Prepared: Useful in Families, and very Serviceable to Country People. By the Honourable R. BOYLE, Esq; Fellow of the Royal Society. To which is annexed a Catalogue of his Theological and Philosophical Books and Tracts. The Second Edition. London: Printed for Sam. Smith, at the Prince's Arms in St. Paul's Churchyard. 1693. Price   Image 2 (unnumbered page) Unnumbered page THE PREFACE OF The Publisher. THese Receipts, taken out of a large Collection, as consisting of a few safe Ingredients, commonly to be found at easie Rates in most places, were sent to a learned Physician beyond Sea: Image 3 (unnumbered page) To whom they were a welcome Present, and answer'd, without doubt, the Ends he had in desiring them. That excellent Person, to whom these choice Prescriptions are owing, did permit a few Copies of them to be Printed, and was pleased to put them in the Hands of some of his Friends, provided, as there was occasion, they would make Tryal of them, and faithsully report the Success. Divers of those, who on these Conditions had received so great a Favour, held themselves obliged to enquire for Persons affected with any Unnumbered page of the Maladies against which the said Medicines were prescribed; and, upon many Experiments carefully made, having found, that frequently they have relieved those who used them, and sometimes strangely outdone Expectation; they addressed themselves with much Importunity to the Noble Author, to suffer Things, which were of such general Benefit, and so easily to be procured by the Poor, to be made more publick. And at length he hath been prevailed with not only to allow the former Receipts, which but few had seen, to be Reprinted, Image 4 (unnumbered page) but hath, out of his rich Treasury, stored us with a fresh Collection, which, as in Number it exceeds what we had before, so in Quality and Virtue it falls not short of it. And if what here, with such an honest and kind Design is offered to the Publick, be but candidly and favourably receiv'd, we may still hope for more Blessings of this sort from him, who has not only a constant Will and great Ability to do good, but hath, perhaps, obliged the Age as much as any private Person in it.   Unnumbered page The Author's PREFACE. THE following Prescriptions are a part of a Collection of Receipts and Processes, that from Time to Time have been recommended to me by the Experience of others, or approv'd by my own: Receipts that being Parable or Cheap, may easily be made servicable to poor Country People. Image 5 (unnumbered page)For Medicines so Simple, and for the most part so Cheap, I have found all of them to be good in their kind: And though I think most of them safer than many other Medicines that are in great Request, yet I do not pretend that these should play the Part of Medicines and Physicians too; but that they may be usefully employed by one who knows how to administer them discreetly. I distinguish them into three Classes or Orders, annexing to the Title of each particular Medicine one of the Three first Letters of the Alphabet; whereof A is the Mark of a Remedy of Unnumbered page the highest Classis of these, Recommended as very considerable and efficatious in its kind. B, Denotes a secondor inferior sort, but yet to be valuable for their good Operations. C, belongs to those Remedies that are of the lowest Order, tho' good enough not to be dispised. Those Receipts, which were my own, are expressed in my own Terms; so also those which I received from others by word of Mouth: But them which were imparted to me in Writing, though I my self would not have worded them, as they did that I had them from, yet I oftentimes made a Scruple to Correct Image 6 (unnumbered page) or Alter their Expressions, tho' not suitable to the Current Style of the Formularies of Receipts, being more concern'd that the Meaning should be close kept to, than the Style rectified.

I. For Coughs, especially such as proceed from thin Rheums. TAke of choice Olibanum,B finely powder'd, from one Scruple to half a Dram, and mix carefully with it an equal weight of Sugar-candy, (white or brown,) or, in want of that, of fine Sugar; and let the Patient take it at Bedtime in the Pap of an Apple, or some other proper Additament, for Image 12 (page 2) several nights together: If it be found needful, it may be taken at any other time, when the Stomach is empty.   II. To give Ease in the Pains of the Stone, even that of the Bladder. TAke the transparent SparrA that grows upon the Veins of Lead-ore, and having reduc'd it to fine Powder, give from half a Dram to a whole Dram of it at a time, in a moderate Draught of some convenient Vehicle. N. B. Though there be (at least in most of our English Mines) two Teguments, as it were, of the Veins of Lead, that grow close together; Page 3 yet that which the Diggers name Cawk, which is white and opacous, is not the Medicine I mean, but the Transparent, or at least Semi-Diaphanous; which easily breaks into smooth Fragments, and in the Fire cleaves into several pieces, that are wont to be smooth, and prettily shap'd.   III For Sharpness of �rine. TAke of the dry stuff thatB divides the Lobes of the Kernels of Walnuts, beat them to Powder, and of this give about half a Dram at a time, in a draught of White-wine, or Posset-drink made with it, or in any other convenient Liquor.   Image 13 (page 4) IV. To Appease the Violent Pains of the Tooth-ach. MAke up a Scruple of PillulaeB Mastichinae, and half a Grain of Laudanum, into two or three Pills for the Patient to take at Bed-time.   V. For Agues. TAke Salt of Card. Benedict.A and Salt of Wormwood ana 15 Grains, Tartar Vitriolate half a Scruple, mix them, and give them Page 5 in a few Spoonfuls of Rhenishwine, or of some other convenient Vehicle, either before the Fit, or at some other time when the Stomach is empty.   VI. For the Yellow-Jaundice. TAke an Ounce of Castle Soap,B (the Elder the better,) slice it thin, put it into a Pint of Smallbeer cold, set it on the Fire, let it boil gently half away, after boiling some time, scum it once; then strain it through a small Sieve, warm it, and drink it all in a morning, fasting; take a small Lump of Sugar after it, and fast two or three hours: The Party may walk about his Business, and eat his accustomed Image 14 (page 6) Meals: If at any time he drinks Wine, let it be Whitewine. N. B. If he be far gone in the Distemper; two or three days after, he may take it once or twice more, and no oftner. Refrain all other Medicines: It will keep a Week or longer.   VII. For the Jaundice. TAke two or three Ounces ofB Semen Cannabis (Hempseed) and boil them till the Seeds (some of them) begin to burst, and a little longer, in a sufficient quantity of New Milk, to make one good Draught; which the Patient is to take warm, renewing it, if need be, for some days together.   Page 7 VIII. For the Dysentery. TAke Pigs-Dung, dry it, andB burn it to grey (not white) Ashes; of these give about half a Dram for a Dose, Drinking after them about three Spoonfuls of Wine-Vinegar.   IX. For the Kings Evil. TAke Cuttle-bone uncalcin'd,B and having scrap'd off the out-side or colour'd part, dry the white part; and of this, finely Image 15 (page 8) powder'd, give half a Dram for a Dose in Aqua Malvae.   X. A Safe and Easie Medicine in Fits of the Stone. TAke Sack, or, in want ofB that, Claret-wine, and by shaking, or otherwise, mix with it, as well as you can, an equal quantity of Oyl of Walnuts; and of this Mixture give from 4 or 6 to 8 or 10 Ounces at a time as a Glyster.    Page 9 DECAD II.  I. For Convulsions, especially in Children. TAke Earth-worms, washB them well in Whitewine to cleanse them, but so as that they may not die in the Wine: Then, upon hollow Tiles, or between them, dry the Worms with a moderate heat, and no further than that they may be conveniently reduc'd to Powder; to one Ounce of which add Image 16 (page 10) a pretty number of Grains of Ambergrise, both to perfume the Powder, (whose scent of it self is rank) and to make the Medicine more Efficacious. The Dose is from one Dram to a Dram and half in any convenient Vehicle.   II. For the Pyles. TAke the Powder of EarthwormsB prepared as in the former Receipt, (but leaving out the Ambergrise,) and incorporate it exactly with as much Hensgrease, as will serve to make it up into an Oyntment. Apply this to the Part affected, whose Pains it usually much and safely mitigates.   Page 11 III. To make Lime-water �seful in divers Distempers. TAke one Pound of goodC Quick-lime, and slake it in a Gallon of warm Water, and let it stand 'till all that will subside be settled at the bottom, and (Separation being made,) the Water swim clear at the top: (At which time it will often happen, that a kind of thin and brittle Substance, almost like Ice, will cover the Surface of the Liquor:) As soon as the Water is thus sufficiently impregnated, delay not to pour it off warily, and keep it very well stopp'd for Use.   Image 17 (page 12) IV. A Lime-water for Obstructions and Consumptions. TAke a Gallon of Lime-waterB made as above, and infuse in it cold, Sassafras, Liquorice, and Anyseeds, of each four Ounces, adding thereto half a Pound of choice Currans, or the like quantity of slic'd Raisins of the Sun: The Dose of this compound Lime-water is four or five Ounces, to be taken twice a day.   Page 13 V. An Amulet against Agues, especially Tertian. TAke a handful of Groundsel,B shred and cut it small, put it into a square Paper Bag of about four Inces every way, pricking that side that is to be next the Skin, full of large holes; and cover it with some Sarcenet or fine Linnen, that nothing may fall out. Let the Patient wear this upon the Pit of his Stomach, renewing it two hours before every Fit.   Image 18 (page 14) VI. For Women in Labour to bring away the Child. TAke about one Dram ofB choice Myrrh, and having reduc'd it to fine Powder, let the Patient take it in a Draught of Rhenish-wine or Sack; or, if you would have the Liquor less active, White-wine, Posset-drink, or some other temperate Vehicle.   VII. For Strengthening the Bowels. TAke Cloves or Chives (notB Bulbs) of Garlick, and let the Patient from time to time Page 15 swallow one or two, without chewing.   VIII. An Amulet against the Cramp. TAke the Root of Mechoacan,A and having reduc'd it to Pouder, fill with this Pouder a little square Bag or Sacket of Sarcenet, or some such slight Stuff; which Bag is to be about three Inches square, and to be hung by a String about the Patient's Neck, so as that it may reach to the Pit of the Stomach, and immediately touch the Skin.   Image 19 (page 16) IX. For Stanching of Blood, especially in Wounds. TAke those round MushroomsA that Botanists call Crepitus Lupi, (in English Puff-balls�) when they are full ripe (which is in Autumn); and breaking them warily, save carefully the Pouder that will fly up, and the rest that remains in their Cavities: And strew this Pouder all over the Part affected, binding it on, or proceeding further, if need be, according to Art.   Page 17 X. For the Tumors and Pains of the Hemorrhoides, not too much inflamed. LET the Patient dip his FingerB in Balsam of Sulphur, made with Oyl of Turpentine, and with his Finger so besmeared anoint the Tumors, whether external or internal, once or twice a day.    Image 20 (page 18) DECAD III.  I. For the Dysentery and other sharp Fluxes. TAke the Stalks andA Leaves of the Herb call'd in Latin, Coniza Media (in English, Flea-bane�) dry it gently, till it be reducible to Pouder; of this Pouder give about one Dram at a time, twice or thrice a day, in any convenient Vehicle; or else incorporate it in Conserve of Red Roses�   Page 19 II. To Sweeten the Blood, and Cure divers Distempers caused by its Acidity. TAke Coral, the clearest andB reddest you can get; reduce it (by exactly grinding it on a Porphory, or Marble Stone,) to an impalpable Pouder. Of this Magistery made without Acids, give the Patient once or twice a day (as need shall require,) a large Dose, viz. ordinarily about one Dram at a time, or from two Scruples to five. N. B. Let him long continue the Use of it.   Image 21 (page 20) III. To clear the Eyes, even from Filmes. TAke Paracelsus's Zibethum OccidentaleA (viz. human Dung) of a good Colour and Consistence, dry it slowly till it be pulverable: Then reduce it into an impalpable Pouder; which is to be blown once, twice, or thrice a day, as occasion shall require into the Patients Eyes.   IV. For Convulsions in Children. GIve the Patient from 2, 3,A or 4, to 5, 6, or 7, Grains, according to the Child's Age, of the true Volatile Salt of Amber, in Page 21 any proper Vehicle. N. B. 'Tis not near so Efficacious in full grown Persons.   V. To bring away the After-birth. GIve about 30 Drops, or anyB Number between 25 and 35, of good Essential (as Chimists call it,) Oyl of Juniper, in a good Draught of any convenient Vehicle.   VI. To strengthen the Stomach, and help the want of Appetite. MAke the Roots of GentianB (sound and not superannuated,) pulverable, with no more waste of their moisture than is necessary. Image 22 (page 22) Reduce these to Pouder; of which let the Patient take from 12 or 15 Grains to double that quantity (or more if need be,) twice or thrice a day. N. B. It may be taken on an empty Stomach, or, if that cannot conveniently be done, at Meal-times. To correct the Bitterness, one may add to it pouder'd Sugar, or make it up with some fit Conserve, or mix it with a Syrup. It is very good, not only for want of Appetite, but for Obstructions. And I (R. B.) have usefully given it in Vertiginous Affections of the Brain, and to lessen, if not quite take away, the Fits of Agues, and even Quartans. But in this last Case the Dose must be considerably augmented. One may also, if one pleases, instead of the Pouder, give the Extract drawn with fair Water, and for those that like that form, made Page 23 up into Pills with a sufficient quantity of pouder'd Tumerick, or the like proper Additament; to which I have sometimes added some Grains of Salt of Wormwood with good Success, in Fluxes that proceeded from Crudities and Indigestion. Where the Winter-Season or the Patients cold Constitution invite, or the Medicine is to be long kept, I chuse rather to make the Extract with Wine moderately strong, than with Water.   VII. For �lcers in the Breast, and elsewhere. TAke Millepedes, (in EnglishA by some called Wood-lice, by others Sows,) and having wash'd them clean with a little Whitewine, and dry'd them with a Linnen Image 23 (page 24) Cloth, beat them very well in a Glass or Marble Mortar (for they ought not to be touch'd with any thing of Metal) and give the first time as much Juice, as you can by strong Expression obtain from five or six of them. This Juice may be given in small Ale or White-wine, in which the next time you may give as much as can be squeez'd out of Eight or Nine Millepedes; and so you may continue, increasing the number that you employ of them by two or three at a time, till it amount to twenty five or thirty; and if need be, to forty or more, for one taking. And note, that if upon the Pounding of these Insects, you find the Mass they afford too dry, as it now and then happens; you may dilute it with a little White-wine or Ale, to be well agitated with it, that being penitrated, and so Page 25 softned, with the Liquor, the Mass may the better part with its Juice.   VIII. For taking off the Fits of Agues. TAke good common BrimstoneB (not Flores Sulphuris,) and having reduc'd them, by passing them through a very fine Sieve, to the subtilest Pouder you can; give of this Pouder one Dram and half or two Drams, either made up into a Bolus with a little good Honey, or else in any appropriated Vehicle; let it be given at the usual times, and reiterated once or twice, if need be, especially if the Fits should return.   Image 24 (page 26) IX. For Fluxes, especially accompanied with Gripings. TAke of Crude Lapis CalaminarisA finely pouder'd two Scruples, of White Chalk one Scruple, mix them exactly, and give them in a spoonful or two of New Milk twice, or, if the case be urgent, thrice a day.   Page 27 X. For the Pains of the Piles. TAke of Myrrh, Olibanum, andB common Frankincense, of each alike quantity; having pouder'd them, mix them very well, and let the Patient receive the Fume of this Mixture, cast upon a Chafsen-dish with Embers, in a Closestool, for about a quarter of an hour, (less or more, as he needs it, and is able to bear it.)    Image 25 (page 28) DECAD IV.  I. For an Outward Contusion. APply to the Part affected,C skim'd or purify'd Honey, spread upon Cap-paper, to be kept on with some convenient Plaister, or the like Bandage, and shifted once or twice a day.   Page 29 II. Another for the same. BEat Aloes Succotrina (or elseB Hepatica,) to fine Pouder; then pour on it as much Rose-water as you guess may dissolve a great part of it. This done, stir them well for a while, and when the Mixture is setled, pour off the Liquor, and in it dip Linnen Rags, which being applied to the Part affected, will soon stick to it, and seldom need be remov'd till the Patient be reliev'd; and then to get them off, the Rags must be well wetted with warm water, which will soften and loosen the adhering Aloes.   Image 26 (page 30) III. For a slighter Excoriation. MElt Mutton-Suet taken fromB about the Kidneys, and freed from its superfluous Fibres or Strings, and to about two Ounces of this add little by little about 16 or 18 Drops (sometimes 8 or 10 may serve) of Oyl (not Aethereal Spirit) of Turpentine; spread this Mixture on a Linnen Cloth, and by binding or otherwise, keep it upon the Part affected.   IV. For an Excoriation, when the true Cutis is affected. TAke Prunella (in EnglishB Self-heal,) and having pounded it very well in a Marble Page 31 or Glass Mortar, (not one of Metal,) apply it to the Part affected, renewing it but seldom, and not without need.   V. To take off the Pain and Inflammation of �lcers in the Legs and elsewhere. IN a Quart of Water boilB about so much White-bread, as in ordinary years may be found in a Halfpenny-loaf; then add to it two Ounces of good Sheeps Suet cut very small; and when that is boil'd a little, add to it one Ounce of finely pouder'd Rosin, and a little well searc'd Brimstone: Of these make a Cataplasm, which is to be kept constantly on the Part affected, and shifted once or twice a day, as need shall require.   Image 27 (page 32) VI. For a Cough, especially accompany'd with a Tickling Rheum. TAke equal Parts of finelyB pouder'd Olibanum and Venice Treacle, incorporate them exactly, and of this Mass form Pills of what bigness you please. Of these let the Patient take about half a Dram at Bed-time, or, if need be, one Scruple, (or more,) twice a day.   VII. To prevent the Tooth-ach, and keep the Teeth sound. LEL the Patient frequentlyB rub his Teeth moderately with the Ashes that remain in Tobacco-pipes, Page 33 after the rest of the Body hath been consum'd in Smoak; sometimes after washing (if need be,) his Mouth with fair Water not too cold.   VIII. For a Rupture, especially in a Child or young Person. TAke of that Geranium orA Cranes-bill that is commonly called Columbinum, reduce the Root and Leaves to fine Pouder, and of this let the Patient take about half a Spoonful Night and Morning for three or four Weeks together, washing it down each time with some Spoonfuls of Red Wine.   Image 28 (page 34) IX. For the Heart-burning as they call it. TAke from 15 or 20, to 30B or 40, Grains of Crabseyes, (known commonly in the Shops by the Name of Lapides Canororum,) reduc'd to very fine Pouder, and either take it alone, or in any convenient Conserve or Syrup. 'Tis for the most part best to take this Medicine when the Stomach is empty.   X. For a Strain. TAke the strongest VinegarB you can get, and boil in it a convenient quantity of Wheat-Bran, Page 35 till you have brought it to the consistence of a Poultess. Apply this as early as may be to the Part affected, and renew it when it begins to grow dry.    Image 29 (page 36) DECAD V.  I. For a Recent Strain. TAKE Worm-wood andB pound it very well in a Mortar of Stone or Glass; then put to it as much of the Whites of Eggs, beaten to Water, as may serve to make it up into such a Consistence, as may be applied like a Poultess to the Part affected.   Page 37 II. A Strengthening Plaister after a Strain, or when there is any Weakness in the Joynt. MELT down togetherB and incorporate very well, two parts of Diapalma, and one part of Emplastrum ad Herniam; spread this Mixture, (but not very thick,) upon Leather, and lay it to the Joynt to be strengthened.   III. For Loosenesses. BOil a convenient quantityC of Cork in Spring-water, till the Liquor taste strong thereof: Of this Decoction let the Patient Image 30 (page 38) drink a moderate Draught from time to time, till he finds himself sufficiently reliev'd by it.   IV. For Obstructions, and divers Diseases proceeding thence. LET the Patient drink, everyB Morning fasting, a moderate Draught of his own �rine newly made, and (if it can conveniently be,) whil'st 'tis yet warm; forbearing Food for an hour or two after it.   Page 39 V. For difficulty of Hearing, from a cold Cause. OUT of a Bulbe or Root ofB Garlick, chuse a Chive of a convenient Bigness; then having pass'd a fine piece of Thread or Silk through one end of it, that thereby it may be pull'd out at pleasure, crush it a little between your Fingers, and having anointed it all over with Oyl of Bitter (or in want of that, Sweet) Almonds, put it into the Cavity of the Patients Ear at Bed-time, and draw it out the next Morning, stopping the Ear afterwards with Black Wooll; but if need require, this Operation is to be reiterated with fresh Garlick for some days successively.   Image 31 (page 40) VI. For Ruptures in the Belly, especially in Children. HAving well cleans'd theA Roots of Sigillum Salamonis, scrape one Ounce of them into a Quart of Broth, and let the Patient take a Mess, or a Porringer full of it for his Break-fast; or else give half a Dram or two Scruples of the Pouder of it at a time, in any convenient Vehicle.   VII. To give Check to Fits of the Gout, and in some measure to prevent them. TAke three Ounces of SarsaparillaB slic'd and cut thin� to these add an equal weight of Page 41 Raisins of the Sun, rubb'd very clean, but not broken: Put both these Ingredients into three Quarts of Spring water, and let the Vessel stand in a moderate heat, that the Liquor may simper for many hours, yet without bursting most part of the Raisins; keep this Decoction, well stop'd, and let the Patient use it for his only Drink, till he need it no longer.   VIII. A Water for �lcers and Sores.

Image 2 (unnumbered page) Unnumbered page TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE, ROBERT, Lord Paston, Baron of Paston, Vicount and Earl of Tarmouth. My Lord, IT is not my intention, nor indeed my Talent, to Celebrate those Excellent Virtues, which shine so eminently bright in your Lordship: For they are Themes only fit to be treated on by the strongest Pen, and their Native Worth and Resplendency are their own sufficient Panegyricks. Yet such is the Veneration I have for the Excellent Qualities and Endowments of your Noble Mind, and those Heroick inclinations, that move your Honour to make such exact, diligent, and curious search into all the Secrets and Mysteries of Nature, and encourage all others that Labour therein, that I cannot forbear being so vain as to publish my resentments thereof to the World. These Reasons, My Lord, together with the consideration of your inbred Candour and Generosity, encouraged me to the boldness of committing this small Treatise to your Honours Patronage and Protection: To whom I know it will be more Image 3 (unnumbered page) welcome, as containing in it the Choice Observations, both in Physick and Chymistry, of that Famous Man, and great Privy Councellor of Nature, Sir K. D. A Name, My Lord, that hath peculiar Charms with it, to recommend all that are under its great shadow, to the value and consideration of all the diligent, the Learned, and the Honourable: So great a Person (may I assume the vanity to say so) I had the Honour and Happiness for several Years to Serve, beyond the Seas, as well as in England, and to attend on him more particularly in the Production of many of his incomparable Experiments, and so to continue till his dying day; when he left with me those Choice things contained in this little Treatise. And since I fear they suffer diminution of their Worth and Beauty, by passing through my mean Hands, and weak Managery, I thought I could make no better Atonement, than by recommending them to receive Recruits and Reinforcements from the Splendour and Eminency of your Illustrious Name. To that end therefore I take the Boldness to prostrate them at your Honours Feet, where also in all Humility lyes Your Honours Most Obedient, and Most Devoted Servant, George Hartman.   Unnumbered page TO THE READER. Courteous Reader, THIS Treatise contains some of the Choicest Collections of the Famous Sir Kenelm Digby (some whereof have been wrought by his own hands, some communicated to him by Learned Men of all Nations) in praise whereof no more need be said, but, that they are his; either of his production, or of his approbation. I shall therefore, omitting other Artifices and Insinuations, only satisfie the Reader with all the clearness and ingenuity I can, how I came by them; and thereby I question not, but I shall very successively recommend this Collection of them to all Ingenious Lovers of Art, whose Ears the Fame of the Worthy Author hath reached. To this End I must acquaint him, that I had the Honour several years to wait upon Sir Kenelm, and to have several of his Manuscripts in my Custody, more particularly this with others was committed to my Image 4 (unnumbered page) Charge, when my Worthy Master intended a Journey to France for his Healths sake, and to settle his Affairs there: And he had Progressed in his designed Journey as far as Cittenburn, when a violent Distemper forced him back again to his own House in Covent-Garden; and in three days after his return, left the Learned World to lament the loss of so great a Man. And here besides his incomparable self, his Friends and Countrey lost also the benefit of his Famous Library he had in France (which for want of his being Naturalized) fell into the French Kings hands, who bestowed it upon a Gentleman, and it was sold (as I was credibly informed) for ten thousand Crowns. In which no doubt were Manuscripts of his own, of very great worth and rich value, and might have much obliged the World, had they fallen into the hands of Generous and Communicative Men. But it was my happiness to have, among some other Manuscripts of his, the sole Propriety of this Choice Manual, which contains rare and profitable Secrets in Philosophy and Chymistry, delivered with more perspicuity and plainness than is yet to be found in any Chymical Book: Yea, such, that any understanding Reader may with great facility be conducted as with an Ariadnean Unnumbered page Line into the most intricate and nitherto fatigating Arcana of Chymistry. Here are the true Menstruums and Alkahests, and that hitherto hidden Secret of Volatilizing the fixed Salt of Tartar without any Heterogene Substance, being the true Vegetable Menstruum; with many other rare and unheard-of Medicines, some whereof I had a mind to reserve for my self, and not to Publish them during my Life, because of the great Experience, and the good Success I have had with them in desperate cases; but Impium est tacere, quae si promulgata essent, multorum misere decumbentium, in levamen extarent. 'Tis Impious and unchristian to forbear the Publication of those things, which being rendred Publick, will effectually redound to the Advantage and Comfort of miserable Men. I have Translated most of these Secrets out of the Latine, French, German, and Italian Tongues. And if I have committed any indecencies against the Idiom of the English Speech, I hope the Candid Reader will forgive a Foreigner. As for any Ornaments and Embellishments of Language, as the Work requires no such Painting, so the Publishers Foreign Stile and mean Talents are not able to afford it. I have no more to acquaint the Reader Image 5 (unnumbered page) with, but that these Secrets had been Communicated to him long before, but that I have been most part of my time since my Excellent Masters Decease, abroad: However, I hope they will be now kindly entertained. For it is the height of my Ambition to make the Memory of my incomparable Master to Live, who was my private, and the Worlds publick Benefactor, which can no where do so with such Advantage as in his Learned Works, for thereby being dead he yet speaks and instructs. And though it be no addition to his Glorious Name, yet for the Wit and smartness of the thing, and the Readers diversion, I shall conclude here with that Elegant Epitaph made on him by the Ingenious Dr. Farrar, which is as followeth.

THe Use of Mineral Waters having deservedly obtain'd a great Esteem and Reputation for the Cure of many Chronical and Rebellious Diseases; some Physicians have applied themselves Image 4 (page 2) to search out, by Experiment, their Nature and Principles; thereby to judge how far they are proper for certain Diseases, and the particular Constitution of the Diseased: While others have been contented to refer themselves to common Opinions founded on the Observations of some Effects. This Matter being subordinate to Physical Speculation, the Royal Academy of the Sciences have determined to employ themselves in the Enquiry of the Qualities of those in this Kingdom, which are most considerable. And till favourable occasion may offer to make Observations at their Springs, they have caused these Waters to be brought from several Provinces, with much care, to examine them in the usual Assemblies of the Naturalists of this Academy. The Resolution to proceed herein has not been taken without much consideration; the Reasons from the advantage of these Waters for the restoring Health in many Diseases, being counterbalanced by those of the Difficulty in knowing the Causes of their Page 3 Proprieties, which depend particularly upon the Mixtures of certain Substances which meet together in their Passages in the Earth, or in the Cavities and Interstices of Rocks, which are various and many, as Vapours, Juices, Salts, Earths, &c.

Published for the benefit of such as languish under any grievous Distemper without Cure. LONDON, Printed by William Godbid for Walter Kettleby, at the Sign of the Bishops Head in Duck-Lane. 1670.    Image 2 (unnumbered page) Page 1 SIR, HAD you not power enough with me to perswade me for your satisfaction, to neglect my own, I should scarcely at this time have comply'd with your desires, in answering your several Quaeries and Objections against both the Theorie and Practice of Chymical Physick; for I find almost all the Galenists that are either totally ignorant of Chymistry, or acquainted only with the Vulgar; such as is that of Crollius, Hartman, Beguin, and their like, so riged opposers of the more occult Philosophy of Hermes, Raymond, Lully, Basilius Valentinus, Paracelsus, Vanhelmont, &c. that they cannot but protest against all their Schollars and followers, as Heterodox, deserters of the Schools, and (to use your own expression) Phanaticks and Canters of such a Philosophy, that were Galen himself again living upon Earth, he would not be able to understand it; and although for your own part I have no reason to believe you of the number of those supercilious Opiners, that scorn to forsake an Errour because vulgarly received; yet I doubt whether the Truth in so plain a dress as I shall expose it, may not startle you also. You are perhaps too tender of the Reputation of Galen, for you ought not to think it any discredit to him, that had never seen so much as common Distillation in his life, to be said not to understand the profound and hidden Mysteries of Natural Phylosophy, plunged in an Abyss inaccessible and imperceivable by any possibility of Witt, without the help of Fire; He well saw that the tenuous and aethereal substance of things, was of greater efficacy than their grosser part, as he confesseth in his 11 Book De Simp. Med. Facul. Quae tenuium sunt partium, iis quae sunt crassarum plus habent efficaciae etiamsi parem sortita fuerint facultatem, nimirum quia melius penitrent; but he knew not how to separate the tennous parts from the implication of the gross, which we do by the help of Fire. Whence I conclude, that he (had he understood Image 3 (page 2) the Art of Chymistry, which in his time lay hid in obscure Hieroglyphicks in the Shrines of Aegypt, would have left us both his Physiology, Pathology, and especially his Method of Healing, quite different from what it is; for it cannot reasonably be imagined, that so curious a searcher into the hidden things of Nature, would have contented himself with a bare rational Analysis of Bodies existing only in the Understanding, had he been acquainted with the Encheiretick, resolving all bodies into Principles subject to Sense, and fit for the use and manual operation of a skilful Physician by the help of Fire. Your Ideal Analysis, by a progressive agitation of the Mind, by which you find contemplation to end where natural composition begins, leads you at last but into the dark Chaos of the Elements, and there begets but this unprofitable conclusion; That because all things are by a mental Resolusion ultimately resolv'd into the four Elements, therefore these are the common Principles of all things. Now how much it may really improve any mans understanding in the Art of Physick, to tell him all things are compounded of the four Elements, more than in Ship-Carpentry, to tell him a Ship is made of Timber, Iron, Hemp, and Tarr, I leave you to judge. We therefore, (in regard the Elements are but remote Principles upon which only God and Nature can work) have by the Resolution of Fire found out nearer Principles subject (as I said) to Sense, and fit for the use of a Spagyrical Physician: these are Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt, which being first separated and cleansed from all heterogeneous feculency, then exalted (by the help of Fire) in power and virtue, we can either use them severally, or conjunctly, according to their virtues, and the curative intention of the Physician; And thus by the help of Fire, we make Medicines easily curing those obstinate Diseases you esteem incurable; By the help of Fire we understand the occult Hermetick and Helmontian Philosophy; and by the help of Fire, with much study, labour, and sweat (never by the bare reading of Books at your ease) may you also be satisfyed of the reality, truth, and excellence of that Physick which you now profess (and I believe you) no more to understand, than the Cantings of Gipsies. But now to your first Quaerie: Page 3Whether it be possible to cure a Disease without a Remedy contrary to the Disease, or at least to its Cause? I answer with the Adepti in the affirmative, and say, Nulla fit sanatio per contraria, quia Morbus proxim� & primari� consistit in Arb�o at substantiae in esse (according to Aristotle) nihil est contrarium. It is not the corporeal substance of the Brain, Heart, Liver, Spleen, &c. that suffers primarily, & per se in their several distempers, though Idiopathical, but the Jusitous Spirit governing the part, and disposing it to perform all natural, Vital, and Animal Functions, which being hurt by the Errour and depravation of the Jufluous Spirit and Topick Ferment, the part necessarily suffers by accident, Quia actio terminatur in corpus. Now the atonie of the Jufluous Spirit and deviation of Ferments happens by ill air, Contagion, Malignant Influence, poisonous Fumes or Odours inspir'd, or entring by the Pores, by Meat or Drink hurtful either in quality or quantity, by Poison or Virulency of ill Physick, by natural or accidental inequality of strength, by retention of Excrements of the several digestions, by transmission from one digestion to another, before a perfect Concoction in the former, &c. So then the right Method of curing Diseases, is primarily by pacation of the Enormontick Spirit, and extinction of Morbifick Idea's, and but � posteriori, by expelling the peccant matter generated by the ataxie of the Spirit: But such a sedation of the Spirit cannot possibly be procured by contraries; does not Fire burn most vehemently, when constring'd by an extreme cold of the ambient? and hot water soonet extinguish Fire than cold, because sooner penetrating its Pores? I could multiply arguments against the Method of curing Diseases by contrary Remedies; but my design is rather to recreate than tire you with too long a Letter. To your next Quaerie, therefore, Whether we acknowledge four� Humours; and if so, Whether various Distempers flowing from the depravation or excess of various Humours, as Synochus simplex, of too much abundance of Blood; Quotidiana Intermittens, of Flegm; Tertiana Intermittens, of Choler; Quartana Intermittens, of Melancholy; all putrifying in the first region of the Image 4 (page 4) Body; and both Quotidian, Tertian, and Quartan, continual from the same humours putrefying in the Vein, may be all cured by one Medicine? In answer to this; First, We deny your Humours, as most repugnant to reason, that under one act of Sanguification, and in the same Vessels, four different Humours should be produc'd, and that naturally in sound and healthful Bodies these Humours should be the efficient causes of future Diseases; For this were to suppose Nature always to erre, etiam in suis finibus. Sense likewise assures us, that although there be a Liquor swimming upon Blood, emitted and cold, of a yellow colour, yet that it is not therefore yellow Bile; for that it is not bitter to the taste: And though the Yellow Jaundies staining the whole Body with a yellow colour, and the Urine with a deep tincture of Red, seem (prima faci�) to prove your Hypothesis of Humours; yet upon an exact Spagyrical examination, you shall find the contrary; for if this tincture of Urine were � flava bile, there must be found in it by Distillation at least some bitterness, either in the Liquor that comes over, or in the Hypostasis, or Caput mortuum; but there is found none, nor could a small quantity of yellow Liquor tinge a large quantity of Urine with a colour deeper than its own. So that we say, Nullus in natura Humor noster, nisi Cruor, Latex, & Secundarius. Now sometimes this Latex, sometimes the Chyle, from the Errour and contagion of degenerated Ferments, and pre-disposition of the matter, receives various tinctures, and puts on the disguise of your supposed Humours. But granting you a Quaternary of Humours, yet we deny them to be truly the efficient causes of Diseases, for manente causa non tollitur Effectus; but very many Diseases we see daily cured by Amulets; Plaisters, Laudanums, Anodynes, Magneticks, &c. without any evacuation of Humours at all; so then the truly Efficient and conjunct Cause is Spiritual, and such a Medicine as can quiet the Archeus, and reduce it to its natural state, shall easily cure all these Distempers, without any regard had to the Purgation, or carrying away of Peccant Humours; for the Jusitous Spirit being strengthened, and the local Ferments restored to their proper Page 5 Energy, your peccant Humours shall soon, by the power of these, be either subacted and compell'd into their genuine perfection, or driven out by the ways most familiar and easie to Nature, truly acknowledged by Hypocrates to be Morborum Curatrix; and in my Opinion, the reason why meer Galenists seldom perform any considerable cure in obstinate Diseases, is for that they wholly prosecute evacuation, and by that means oftentimes disable Nature, (especially by Phlebotomy) from doing what she would be able oftentimes of her own strength to perform, never aiming primarily and directly (but thus only by accident) at the re-establishing of Nature; and no marvel, since this way of Healing is not performable without the help of such Arcana as are only known to Chymists, and of them, only to the Adepti, not every vulgar Professor of Chymistry. But you urge a necessity (in the right Method of Healing) of having respect not only to the expulsion of Peccant Humours, but also to the extinction of praeternatural heat by cooling Medicines, and refocillation of cold, by heating ones; as for Example, in the cure of Anasarcha, which you say is from an immoderate refrigeration of the Liver and Veins; of a Fever, which is from a praeternatural heat kindled first in the Heart, and thence diffusing it self through the whole Body; of Bradypepsia and Apepsia, from the coldness of the Stomach; of Boulimia, from an extraordinary heat of the Stomach suddainly precipitating digestion, and causing almost a continual want of aliment; and likewise in implicite and compounded Diseases that are contrary to each other, as a hot Liver, and cold Stomach; whatsoever Medicines should by their heating quality be proper in the Cure of Anasarcha, Bradypepsia, Apepsi, and cold Distemper of the Stomach must in respect of that heat, be quite contrary in a Fever, Boulimia, and hot Liver. I answer still with the Adepti; That Heat and Cold (as I said of Hmours) are not the efficient Causes of Diseases, but the Antecedent, and therefore though their consideration be Diagnostick yet not Curative, non calor & frigus (says Hypocrates) sed acidum, acre, amarum, ponticum, &c. sunt morborum causae. Heat and cold praeternatural, are indeed an effect of the enraged vital Spirit, Image 5 (page 6) which being once quieted, the natural temper presently returns; and as for the hot Liver and cold Stomach, which so much puzzles you, that you know not which way to direct your curative intention, as appears by your Method: Impliciti compositique morbi si dissentiant, nec prorsus huic, nec illi, sed utrique mediocritate qu�dam succurendum: which is in effect but a needless kind of despair of a Cure; whereas I am able to assure you, that if for the future you can find out such a Remedy as can re-invigorate the languishing tone of the Stomach and Liver, restore their deviated Ferments, and appease the Archeus, which may be all done with one Medicine, without any regard had either to the cold of the one, or heat of the other, you shall quickly, safely, and pleasantly cure both; and by the like Method, all other Diseases vulgarly ascribed to Heat and Cold. You attribute Concoction to the Heat of the Stomach, and to the diminution of this Heat, want of Digeston, and all Diseases happening thence; but that Heat is not the efficient Cause of Digestion, seems manifest; For 1. Fishes digest without any actual Heat, and to say that potential sufficeth, is scarcely consonant to Reason, that a thing barely in potentia, should actu jam agere. 2. There ought to be as many Degrees of Heat specifically different, as there are specifical differences of Concoction, in the Stomachs of Animals of different species; for whatsoever is produc'd specifically different, ought likewise to have the efficient Cause of that difference specifically different, otherwise, Quidlibet generetur � quolibet indifferenter, which I think no man will affirm. Besides, What degree of Heat must we allow the Stomach of an Ostrich, easily digesting Leather, Cloth, and even Nails of Iron? what degree of heat in Boulimia for the Digestion of the coursest Food, in so large a quantity, and so fast, that the Stomach is scarcely ever to be satisfi'd? Riverius confesseth this cannot possibly be from a more intense Heat, since Meat boiled in a Pot with the strongest Heat that can be invented, and continued for many days, cannot by this means be resolv'd into a Chylous Liquor, much less Bones, as in the Stomach of a Dog in the space of an hour: I know you shift this off to a peculiar faculty, but a faculty cannot act without Page 7 an Instrument, so that you are constrained to flie to the Idiosyncrasie of the part, which you teach to be a certain proportion of first qualities; but of all the first qualities, Heat is the most active, which nevertheless, as has been already shew'd, cannot have the power of so suddain a liquation of Meats, so that after much struggling, you are at last but where you began. We therefore ascribe the difference of Digestions, not to Heat, but to formal proprieties, and the operation of the specifical Ferments. By what hath been said, your Objections borrow'd out of Helvetius, against the possibility of an universal Medicine, seem sufficiently answer'd; Nevertheless, take this Argument: Health is but one simple Homogeneal integrity of Life, Nature but one, but one sole Spirit, the Governour and Moderator of Life, which alone labours under Diseases, and is alone (it by a powerful Medicine sufficiently strengthened) able to overcome all Diseases; why then may not one Medicine, such as the Liquor Alkahest of Paracelsus, his Tinctura Lili ab Electro Minerali, his Tinctura Lili Antimonialis, his Mercurius vitae, his Mercurius Diaphoreticus dulcis & fixus, his Ignis veneris, his Corallatus, his Elixir Proprietatis, or any other equal to these, be able to cure all Diseases? and although I am not as yet so happy my self, as to be Master of any one of these, yet in Confirmation of this Hetrodoxical Doctrine, I will undertake (provided the Patients you shall assign me for the tryal, will faithfully comply in taking the Medicines, and carefully observe the order prescrib'd them) to cure all sorts of Fevers how malignant and complicated soever, with one Medicine; your distempers of a hot Liver and cold Stomach, with one Medicine, and for the most part, Sanguine, Bilious, Melancholy, and Flegmatick Diseases, (as you esteem them) with one Medicine, which I hope will make you change you Opinion of the necessity of curing Diseases by their contrary Remedies. And as for those obstinate Diseases, whereof many are esteemed by you incurable, and the rest seldom or never cured by the vulgar Method, as the Dropsie, the Gout, Stone in the Reins and Bladder, Apoplexy, Co""u, Falling Image 6 (page 8) Sickness, Madness, Furor uterinus, Scurvy, French Pox, Small Pox, Griping of the Gutts, of which so many hundreds fell the last Autumn, Hysterica passio, with almost the whole Catalogue of Diseases, wheresoever the vital Spirit, and tone of the part affected, are not so weakened, that no Medicine can work its effects; to end the dispute between us, whether Chymical or Galenical Physick be the most powerful and successful, and which of them the most worthy of esteem by you, and all wise and unbyassed persons; Let there be some of all, or the most of these Diseases put into my hand as soon as you please, and if you do not find me by the help of Chymical Physick, to cure even the hardest of them with less annoyance, less disturbance, less weakening the Spirits and force of the Patient, and incomparably more expedition, safety, and certainty, than your ordinary Physicians cure light and easie Distempers, let me be no longer held by you worthy of Credit, or have any place in your esteem; But if I do, (as by the Grace of God you will certainly find I shall) I doubt not, but for the future you will give the preference to Chymical Physick, and not think me in this guilty of vanity or ostentation, which I have made known unto you out of the sincerity of my heart, inerrable experience, my love of the truth, and (I hope) to the inestimable benefit of such as shall need and require my help. But you apprehend Chymical Medicines to be dangerous, as being many of them extracted out of poysonous Metals and Minerals, as Iron, Copper, Tinn, Lead, Mercury, Antimony, &c. and corrosive Salts, as Vitrial, Nitre, Tarter, Bay Salt, &c. but you seem more especially to be affrighted at Antimony and Mercury; and truly if you mean their vulgar preparations, (which nevertheless you commonly make use of your selves,) such as are the Vitrum, and Flores Antimonii, Crocus Metallorum, the ordinary Mercurius vita, Praecipitates and Sublimates, I so much abhor them my self, that I detest the use of them. But I have by me certain preparations out of A and ? far more precious than Gold, with which I know how to cure almost all curable Diseases in the body of man, and so safe, that I give them commonly Page 9 to little Children, without ever having found the least harm or inconvenience in them; some of them Purge not at all, but are Diaphoretick, Alexipharmacal, Balsamical, Restaurative, and Pacative: and those that do, never cause any superpurgation, though the Patient by mistake should take a double or treble Dose. Out of ? can I make many excellent Medicines, whereof one particularly and especially cures the POX, though ever so full of raging pains, Tophi, and Ulcerous exesions. Cut of Antimony, Basilius Valentinus says, he knew how to make above 300 several preparations, whereof he valued many as more precious and universal than potable Gold; Nevertheless, esteeming himself yet but a Learner and Searcher into the innumerable Virtues and Proprieties of Antimony. Quercitan says, there are in A 600 Proprieties. Our most Learned Roger Bacon made an Oyl out of Antimony, which he affirms to be little inferiour not only in Medicine, but also in Transmutation of Metals, to the great Elixir of the Phylosophers. Of Antimony Paracelsus made some of his most stupendious Arcana; as his Lili Antimoniale, his Mercurius vitae, with which he could cure all the Diseases in the Body of Man, and says of A, that as it separates from Gold all Heterogeneous admixture and impurity, so doth it from the Body of Man all Diseases. And of Mercury, both he and Van Helmont made their miraculous. Alkahest. ? is certainly the most precious Jewel in the whole treasure of the Mineral Kingdom of Nature, from which alone 	 it self borrows its perfection. If I would now comunicate to you but what is known to my self that am but a Scholar in the Schools of these two great Masters of Natural Philosophy of the Virtues and hidden Mysteries of these two Minerals, I must instead of a Letter, write a Volumn, which is at present far from my purpose and your expectation. Now as to Saturn, Mars, Venus, which you likewise apprehend to be dangerous; out of Saturn alone, Paracelsus professeth himself able to cure at least 200 several Diseases, out of @ he made his Ens Veneris, one of his greatest Arcana, and says of B, that he does, valida pugnacique manu morbor quemplurimos etiam contumacissimos domittare, hear your Riverius in the Image 7 (page 10) praise of B in the cure of Hypochondriack Melancholy, Scurvy, most affectious of the Liver and Spleen, Ulcers of the Stomach, Green Sickness, and many others. At caeteris omnibus remediis palmam praeripit Sal Martis, quod obstructiones aperit viscera corroberat, earumque calidam intemperiem emendat, &c. A certain Physician you well knew, got more Fame and Riches than any of his time in this Town, by means of a secret operative preparation of Steel, with which he really perform'd many greater and more considerable Cures, than others equal to himself in all other considerations. But you fill me with admiration, that you should fear the corrosive quality of Vitriol, Tartre, Nitre, and Bay Salt, you may draw a Menstruum out of Bread or Honey, that will dissolve Flints, and �lstadius out of Honey makes a dissolvant of Gold; would you therefore be affraid of the use of Bread or Honey? you know the juice of Limons dissolves Pearl and Coral, and yet most grateful and friendly to the Stomach; and why should these Spirits temper'd with the allay of other milder Liquors, ad gratam aciditatem, be more dangerous? Indeed common experience shews you the contrary; besides you ought to consider the difference between the hard Bodies of Stones and Mettals, and the softer Membranes of the Stomach, irrigated continually with a Balsamick vital moisture: Aqua fortis that corrodes Stones and Mettals, whill not penetrate Wax. But to leave you no ground of suspition, I can shew you how to make them freed from their corrosive aciditie, pleasant to Taste and Smell, and highly exalted in Virtue. But this I confess is a great secret, especially that of the Volatile Salt of Tarter, of which Paracelsus and Van Helmont affirm, that it penetrates into the most inward and remote parts, cleansing them from all impurity, instar saponis cuncta abstergens & omnem � venis amurcam detergens, &c. But though you have oblig'd me to make this just vindication of Chymical Physick, I would not have you think I either despise or neglect the excellent use of Herbs, which I acknowledge with Van Helmont, to be pentacula Divini amoris. Out of Animals and Vegetables I can make Medicines that cure the Gout and Dropsy, with that certainty, as scarcely to miss two in Page 11 twenty. But indeed, as is our Method of Healing, so are our ways of preparation very different from yours; You in your Decoctions consume commonly a third part, sometimes half or more, in which consumption a great deal of the Spirit and Volatile Salt of the Ingredients, which contains their highest Virtues, is evaporated and lost; of the certainty of this loss, both your Smell and Taste will bear you witness: We, on the contrary, so make our Decoctions, that the whole virtue of the Crassis of the Plant is preserv'd without any diminution; I leave it now to your self to judge whether you or we may reasonably hope for the better success in this particular; the like difference is between your Distillations and ours; you for the most part add water, or at least draw over but the Flegmatick part of the Plant, with some very small part of its Sulphur, which gives it something of its natural smell and Taste, leaving nevertheless almost all its Sulphur, and totally all its Alkalious Salt behind; so that your distill'd waters carry only the name, little of the virtue of the Plant from which they are drawn: We first stamp the Hearb, and draw its water, then cohobe it so often upon the caput mortuum, till we have brought over its Sulphur, and lastly calcine the remaining feces, and with the waters extract its own Salt, and then Circulate them together; and thus are the Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt united, which completes the virtue of the whole Plant, and compar'd to yours, is worthy of the name of an Essence; this is indeed laborious and costly, but in its effects largely recompenceth both. There remains yet an Objection against Chymical Physick to be answered, which you offer not as your own, but as received by common Report. That Chymical Physick, though for the present it conquer many Diseases held incurable, yet that afterwards it shortens the lives of such as have been so cured. There is indeed such a senseless calumny current amongst Women, and the weaker sort of Men industriously disseminated amongst them, by some hoping perhaps by this art the better to keep up their own Esteem and Reputation, which otherwise by their abilities they find themselves not likely to maintain. But Image 8 (page 12) to avoid contention, let common Experience determine this difference between us. For my own particular, I can faithfully assure you, that by Chymical Physick I have cured my self of the Vertigo, and Gout, both in great extremity; it is now 4 years since, and I have not (I bless God) to this day relaps'd again into either, nor have I found any harm, but on the contrary, many benefits to my health by such Medicines, tending in all probability to the prolongation of my life; and if I had not grounded my esteem of Chymical Physick upon good reason and sufficient experience, you might think me mad, to make desperate practices upon my own Life. My Lungs are naturally so tender and weak, that had it not been for Chymical Medicines, I cannot think I could have liv'd to see this day. But inform your self further, and you shall find that those that have been long accustomed to Chymical Physick, have preserv'd their Lives and Health much longer, and more comfortably, than those acquainted only with your Druggs; for consider impartially, how few escape death in contumacious Diseases by means of Galenical Medicines, loathsome, tedious, and for the most part ineffectual; and those that do, how slowly do they recover their colour, appetite, and strength, remaining long in continual fear and danger of relapse? such large quantities of Physick as your slow Method requires, so depauperates the vital Spirit, and oppresses Nature, that it may be known many times a year after, from what Method they receiv'd their Cure: whereas we in the same Diseases perfect the Cure quickly, with little Physick, and in small Doses, such as can hardly be nauseous to the nicest and most delicate Stomachs; and in our whole scope, our Method directs us not to enervate (as you do) but to erect deficient Nature, not to extenuate, but reintegrate the languishing Spirit: and is it then likely that Chymical Medicines taken from the hands of a skilful Chymical Physician, appeasing and strengthening the Archeus, restoring the Ferments, which alone in their intire vigour, are able to overcome all Diseases, as being the undoubted Authors of transmutation, friendly and comfortable to Nature, should nevertheless shorten Life? besides the evidence of Reason, I can Page 13 testify out of my own diligent Observation and Experience (and that fido animo) the contrary. But I believe I need not take much pains to satisfie you in this particular, I know you are too sharp sighted to be miss-led by such an Ignis Fatuus; on the contrary, I rather believe you inclinable to acquaint your self fully with the Theory, and manual operations of Chymistry, which though it cost you (as it hath done me) much Time, Sweat, and Money, yet if you prove equally successful, I dare promise it shall never give you cause to repent you: for (I speak it without boasting) I have by the help of this Art easily and quickly cured Diseases quite desperate in the hands of very able and experienced Galenical Physicians. Truly were not Chymical Physick incomparably more powerful and safe, than Galenical, I do not see how I could excuse my self in leaving at any time, the trodden, smooth, and easie paths of the vulgar or Galenical Method, in which I am graduated as well as you, to follow those of the Chymical, painful, costly, sublime, and so secret, that but a few have ever rightly understood: pauci quos aequus amavit Jupiter, hoc potn�re At the worst can be said; surely he that understands both Physicks, is likely to perform more than he that understands but one; but I must not transgress the limits of a Letter, let what has been said suffice for the present, till I Print my Synopsis Medico-Chymica, which is almost finished, and I shall be ready at our next meeting to give you further satisfaction in any thing: In the mean time I pray do me that right to believe, that what I have said in Vindication of Chymical Physick, hath been without the least animosity, or intention of prejudice to the Person or Practice of any man, purely in defence of the Truth, and that whatsoever I have undertaken to do my self in my own particular, the better to confirm you, I will by the Grace of God, whensoever you shall offer me the occasion, faithfully Image 9 (page 14) make good; and further, that I shall unalterably remain upon all Tryals.

Page 1 The Aurora of the Philosophers by Paracelsus.  CHAP. I. Of the Original of the Philosophick Stone. ADAM was the first Inventor of Arts, because he had the knowledge of all things, as well after the fall as before the fall; from thence he presaged the worlds destruction by water; Hence also it came to pass that his Successors erected two tables of stone, in the which they ingraved all Natural Arts, and that in Hieroglyphical Characters, that so their Successors might also know this presage, that it might be heeded, and provision or care Image 6 (page 2) made in time of danger. Afterwards, Noah found one of the tables in Armenia under the Mount Araroth, when the deluge was over: In which [Table] were described the courses of the superiour Firmament, and of the inferiour Globe, and [also] of the Planets; then at length this Universal Notion of Knowledge was drawn into several particulars, and lessened in its Vigor and Power, in so much that by means of that separation, One became an Astronomer, another a Magus, another a Cabalist, and a fourth an Alchymist: Abraham that most great Astrologer and Arithmetitian conveyed [it] out of the Countrey of Canaan into Aegypt, whereupon the Egyptians arose to so great a head and dignity, that the wisdom [or science] of the same thing was derived from them to other Nations and Countreys. And for as much as the Patriarch Jacob painted [as twere] the sheep with various colours, it was done by a part or member of Magick; for in the Theology of the Chaldeans, Hebrews, Persians and Egyptians, they proposed these arts (as the highest Philosophy) to be learned by their chiefest Nobles and Priests: So it was in Moses his time, wherein both the Priests and even Page 3 the Physitians were chosen amongst the Magi� they indeed [viz. the Priests] for the Examination or Judging, of what related to soundness or health, especially in the knowledge of the Leprosie; Moses likewise was instructed in the Egyptian Schools at the Costs and Care of Pharaohs daughter, so that he excelled in all their Wisdom or Learning; So was it which Daniel; he in his young dayes suckt in the Learning of the Chaldeans, so that he became a Cabalist. Witness his Divine foretellings, and exponnding of those words, Mene Mene Tekel Phares: These words are to be understood by the Prophetick and Cabalistick Art: The Tradition of this Cabalistical Art, was very familiar with Moses and the Prophets, and most of all in use; The Prophet Elias foretold many things by his Cabalistical Numbers. Even so the Antient wise men, by this Natural and Mystical Art, learned to know God rightly, and abode and walked in his Laws and statutes very firmly; It likewise is evident in the Book of Samuel, that the Berelists did not follow the Devils part, but became (by Divine permission) partakers of Visions and true Apparitions, the which we shall treat Image 7 (page 4) more largely of in the book of Snpercelestials. The gift thereof is granted by the Lord God to the Priests who walk in the divine precepts. It was a custom amongst the Persians, never to admit any one as King, unless a Sophist [or Wise man] exalted both in reality and name; and this is clear by the usual name of their Kings, for they were called Sophists. Such were those Wise men and Persian Magi that came from the East to seek out Christ Jesus, and are called natural Priests. Likewise the Egyptians having obtained this Magick and Philosophy from the Chaldeans and Persians, would that their Priests should also learn the same wisdom, wherein they became so fruitfull and succesfull, that all the neighbouring Countreyes admired them� This was the cause why Hermes was truly stiled Trismegistus because he was both a King, a Priest, and a Prophet, a Magitian, and a Sophist of Natural things; such another also was Zoroastes.  Page 5 CHAP. II. Wherein is declared that the Grecians drew a good part of this Learning from the Egyptians, and how it came from them to us. AFter that a Son of Noah possessed the third part of the world after the Flood, this Art brake in violently [as it were] into Chalde and Persia, and from thence into Egypt; The which [Art] being a little smelt out by the superstitious and idolatrous Grecians, some of them that were more wise and sage, betook themselves to the Chaldeans and Egyptians, that so they might draw in, out of their Schools the same wisdom; But now whereas the Theological or Bible-study of the Law of Moses did not so well please them, they confided in their own proper Genius, and fell away from the right foundation of those natural secrets and arts. This is evident by their fabulous Conceptions and stumblings about the doctrine of Moses. Twas the Egyptians custom to propose those Traditions of that so excellent wisdom meerly in Enigmatical figures Image 8 (page 6) and abstruse Histories and Terms. The which was afterwards shadowed by Homer, by an admirable poetical artifice: Herewith was Pythagoras also acquainted, who mixed [with his writings] very many things out of the Law of Moses and the Old Testament. In like manner Hippocrates, Thales Milesius, Anaxagoras, Democritus and others, did not forbear to apply their conceptions hereunto. Although none of them were skilfull of the true Astrology, Geometry, Arithmetick or Medicine; for their pride so hindered, that it would not admit of Disciples of other Nations. And when they had got some sight as twere from the Chaldeans and Egyptians, they became by this accident far more proud then they were afore naturally; and without any fear did acuate or set out the thing or substance it self with subtiler figments and lyes, and then attempted to describe a certain kind of Philosophy, which came and descended from them to the Latines. They being now seasoned and instructed herewithal, adorned it with their dictates also: from all which this Philosophy was sowed abroad all Europe, and then many Academies were made for the propagation of their Page 7 Decrees and Rules, that so youth might be instructed; and this doth now flourish with the Germans and other Nations even nuto this very day.   CHAP. III. What was taught in the Schools of the Egyptians. THE Chaldeans, Persians and Egyptians had [all of them] the same knowledge of the secrets of nature and the same Religion, the names only being changed. The Chaldeans & Persians called their doctrine Sophia and Magick; and the Egyptians, because of the sacrifice, called their wisdom the Priest-hood. The Magick of the Persians, and Theology of the Egyptians were both of them heretofore taught in the Schools. Albeit there were many Schools and Learned men in Arabia, Africa & Greece, as Albumazar, Abenzagel, Geber, Rasis and Avicen, amongst the Arabians Machaon, Podalirius, Pythagoras, Anaxagoras, Democritus, Plato, Aristotle and Rodianus amongst the Grecians; but yet there were various opinions amongst themselves as to the Egyptian Image 9 (page 8) wisdom, wherein they differed, and disagreed from it. For this cause Pythagoras would not be called Sophist, because the Egyptian Priesthood and Wisdom was not at all perfectly taught as was fitting, although he received thence many Mysteries and Arcanums; and Anaxagoras [had received] most or exceeding many. This appears by the disputations which he made of Sol & the stone thereof, & which he left after his death, yet he was in many things contrary to the Egyptians; Wherefore even they would not be called Sophists nor Magi, but imitating Pythagoras in that thing they assumed the name of Philosophy; but yet they reaped no more then a few Glances like shadows, from the Magick of the Persians and Egyptians; But Moses, Abraham, Solomon, Adam, Elias, and the Magi that came from the East to Christ, were true Magi, and Divine Sophists, and Cabalists; which Art and Wisdom the Grecians knew very little of, or none at all; and therefore we shall leave that Philosophical Wisdom of the Greacians as a Speculation widely and largely distant, and separated from other true arts and sciences.   Page 9 CHAP. IV. What Magi the Chaldeans, Persians and Egygtians were. MAny have attempted both to search out and bring to use the most secret Magick of those wise men; but yet it hath not hitherto been done; Many even in this our age do exalt Trithemius, others Bacon and Agrippa for Magick and the Cabal, which [two things] seem not in the least to agree, not knowing why they do so; Magick indeed is an art and faculty by which the Elementary bodies, and their fruits, their proprieties, virtues, and obstruse operations are attained unto. But the Cabal, by a subtile understanding of the Scriptures seems to trace out the way for men to God, how to act with him, and prophecy from him; for the Cabal is full of Divine Mysteries, even as the Magick is full of natural secrets; for it teacheth presages and foretellings of or from the nature of things to come and things present; for its opparation consisteth in the knowing of the intrinsecality of all Creatures as well Celestial as Terrestial bodies, [viz.] what is hidden in them, what 2 pages missing	 Image 10 (page 12) ry and Ternary ascend to the denary [then] is made their regress [or reduction] unto Unity. Therein is concluded all the occult wisdom of things, the which [wisdom] God hath made openly manifest to men, both by his word, and the Creatures, of his hands, that so they might have a true knowledge of them, the which shall be declared more at large in another place.   CHAP. V. Of the chiefest and most supream essence of things. THE Magi by their wisdom affirmed, that all creatures might be brought to an united substance, which [substance] they affirmed, might by their mundations and purgations, ascend unto so high a subtilty, divine nature and occult propriety, so as to work and effect things admirable. For they considered that by the returning into the earth, and by a supream Magical Separation, a certain perfect substance would come forth, the which at length, is by exceeding many industrious and very prolix preparations Page 13 exalted and lifted up out of Vegetable substances into Mineral, and out of Mineral into Metalline, and out of Mettalline perfect substances into a perpetual and divine Quint-essence concluding in it self the essence of all Celestial and Terrestial Creatures; The Arabians and Grecians by the occult Characters and Hieroglyphical descriptions of the Persians and Egyptians, attained to secret and abstruse Mysteries, the which being gotten, and in part understood, and partly not, they ocularly saw (by trying and experiencing) many admirable and strange things. But because the Supercelestial Operations lay more profoundly hid, then their capacity could reach unto, they called not this a supercelestial Arcanum according to the intention and mind of the Magi; but the Arcanum of the Philosophers, and (according to the advice and judgement of Pythagoras) their stone. Such now as ever obtained this [stone] did shadow it over with various Enigmatical figures, and deceptory similitudes, comparisons, and fictitious sayings, that so the matter thereof might be occult and hidden, very little or no knowledge whereof can be had [from them.]   Image 11 (page 14) CHAP. VI. Of various Errors as to the matter, its finding out and knowledge. The Philosophers have prefixed sundry most occult names to this matter of the stone, grounded on sundry similitudes; The which Arnoldus observing, saith in his Rosary, that the greatest difficulty is to find out the matter of this stone; for they have called it Vegetable, Mineral, and animal, not according to the litteral sence, as is well known to such wise men as have tried the divine secrets and miracles of the same stone. For example sake Raymund Lullies Lunaria may be produced, which gives flowers of admirable virtues familiar to the Philosophers themselves. But yet this was not the intention of those Philosophers, that you should think they meant thereby any projection upon mettals, or that any such preparation should thence be made; but the abstruse mind of the Philosophers hath another intent; In like manner they called their matter by the name Martagon, to which they applyed an occult Alchymical operation, Page 15 when as notwithstanding that [name] denotes nothing e""se but a certain most occult similitude.

Unnumbered page TO THE READER. Reader, I Was concerned in my mind, what to call you, courteous, or kind; But since the Scene of this our Orb represents men moving so erratically, and varying in that extremity from the Ecliptick of a fixt Judgment, certainly I should have been frustrated in wooing your candour or gentleness; dayly converse gives me the occasion of observing the variable Fates of Authors Works, which although indited by accurateness it self, and accomplisht with Herculean labours, are oft termed stuffe by some; and to others again, the works of a Divinity scarce seem to surpass them: But to render Lines harmonical to every Ear is one of the humane Impossibilities; and no small difficulty to a divine Pen. However all Volumns sail through an Ocean so terrible by Oricanes from Mens Tongues, the more by reason they are tossed to and fro without the conduct of their Pilot, yet it is not this Image 6 (unnumbered page) Charybdis of a carping Momus, or that Scylla of a livid Zollus shall prevail to keep these upon the stocks, but rather precipitate them upon a Voyage, with a venture of their whole lading full of Novelties, suspending my thoughts in the interim for a return: Not a recompence of vain glory, nor a reproof relished with contempt, neither being placed in one Scale of a ballance over powers the other containing no more than an empty air; And should not that be far short of my scope, marked with a single Character of truth, and advancement of Learning, setting aside any  in non-Latin alphabet 	. The faces of most things appearing yet clouded, many but partly unmask; as many, although of themselves clear, covered under a vail of dark terms and absurd notions of Philosophers, cannot but spur any sensible Genius to discuss that muddiness of some, and redeem the light of others, in the performing whereof I have here ingaged my self in these Treatises, taking what advantage long time, hard study, and laborious experiments would contribute thereunto. The only Instruments, that I have imployed in the sounding of the natures of beings, are the external senses, assuming nothing, or concluding no inference, without their advice and undoubted assent, whether in Metaphysicks, Theology, or Natural Philosophy. Those terms or notions, that only give a confuse testimony of their being to the understanding, escaping the evidence of external sence, we have declined as rocks, whereon any one might otherwise easily make shipwrack of his sensible knowledge. Wherefore whatever subject insisted upon within these narrow Pages, doth not crave a necessary, evident, plain and demonstrable assent, as being only attempted by external sense, mediately or immediately, my desire is the Reader would apprehend it to be no part of my Book. But to give you a more particular account of my design, I Unnumbered page shall first discover to you my intention in annexing Natural Theology: My thoughts fluctuating in a mist, astonisht at the multiplicity of all kinds of bodies moving about me, advised to stear their course to some immoveable, whereupon they might fix themselves, and thence to ponder upon others; here they certainly concluded one universal immoveable, whereon and whereby all moveables are moved; because there can be no moveable, but must necessarily have its respect to an immoveable, they being relations, which are constituted at the same time. My next assumption following the chorea of the first, and drawn from the relation interceding between an immoveable and moveable, resolved me, that a Moveable must necessarily be derived from an Immoveable; whence I was soon confirmed of an universal Creator of the whole Universe: Thence I made a digression into the reason and cause of the creation of all moveables, particularly of my self, and so keeping strait on my Road, behold my steps, markt and digested in the fourth Book of my Philosophy, which by reason of their prius ought to have been ranckt in the front, all men naturally converting their first thoughts thither; but for orders sake have inserted them elsewhere. Here I found the camp, whereon Atheism and natural Faith were to encounter each other; but the former being intrencht within the flesh, to have much the advantage of the latter standing bare upon so slippery a ground, whence it is, that the greatest part of the World, yea, of Christendom render themselves up captives and eternal slaves to the obedience of the devil, in the service of Atheism, engaged in actions of Abomination, Horrour, and Blasphemy. Notwithstanding since the ruines of those lines of Blessedness and Innocency, yet discernable in the souls of all men, are possible to be raised up again, whence they may easily demolish and batter down those strong Image 7 (unnumbered page) Bulworks of Pernicion, it is that part of fortification I have endeavoured to delineate, the knowledge whereof is absolutely necessary for Salvation, and is a Key wherewith to unlock the Mysteries of eternal happiness, revealed to us by the holy Scriptures, which being founded upon the greatest and truest reason, must certainly require a gradual ascent to it from natural Theology, being a rational discourse inferring Theorems of Salvation from Humane Reason, subordinate to the highest of the Scriptures. Wherefore all evidence doth direct us to make this our mark or circle, whence we are to run to that blessed Meta of the other. But how preposterous and rash is it for men to slip over this part, and to cast themselves without a bottom into the very depth of divine Theology? Alas their apprehension is immediately drowned in it; their understanding amazed at those fathomless pits of reason; in what different and monstrous acceptions do most Divines attach the genuine sense of Scripture, through ignorance of its precedents, scope, & dependance? And more than this, each invokes the Holy Ghost for a Witness for to attest those various Interpretations. But what is this, but their heavy dull imaginations hallucinating in the appearance of the Scriptures, like several eyes in apparent objects of the Sky, some framing this, others that likeness of them? I am not now to be confirmed in my belief, that the worst of Atheism is latent in many supposed Divines, their sinister ends, cheats, and vile secret passions of the flesh betraying their hypocrisie. Certainly, were I put to pick (out of any Profession) some that were to surmount all others in wickedness, I should not need long time to ponder upon my Verdict. The cause of this perversity I can state none but presumption in those, who after a twelve-moneths dosing upon Ursin's Cat. or Ames. Medul. do apprehend they should Unnumbered page know the whole drift and connection of the Fundamentals of Sacred Writings, which to the same appearing upon a reflection, dishering, and strange in expressions, have soon confounded their small relicts of natural faith into a detestable Atheism, however cloathed with a dissembled time-holiness under their dark habits for to feed their covetousness out of their Benefices. Had these but conferred with their innate Principles of Natural Theology, and arrived to the habit therof before they had applied themselves to the top of inspired Learning, beyond all surmising, the Fundamentals of this latter would have been evidenced to them to be the alone absolute Wisdom, plain Truth, and most certain infallibility. Notwithstanding so universal a neglect of this part, yet I question not, but many may be found so well principled in both, that their undoubted Faith, expressed in their most Holy Life and Actions, will prove a great happiness to their Followers and Hearers in such Leaders and Teachers. Next touching my Scope in the Metaphysicks, which was principally the substitution of such Theorems in them, as might be demonstrated by sense, and had their sole dependance upon it, in order to a confutation of those absurd Notions purely Logical, (although sold for real ones,) that Aristotle proposed in his Metaphysicks; in the interpretation and ambiguities whereof Schollars do usually consume a whole age in vain, reaping no better fruits thence, than that after seven years study they are enabled to say Formaliter, or Materialiter to every thing. But lastly, my chiefest design ever since the seventeenth year of my age, when I had just finisht my course in Physick, and taken my last degree, consisted in elaborating such demonstrations in Natural Philosophy, as might serve to unfold the natures of Beings in relation to the Art of Physick, hitherto so uncertain, blind, and unfounded on Image 8 (unnumbered page) Art, that I dare confidently assert, that the cure of many (if not of most) diseases is rather to be imputed to the strength of bodies, than the application of vulgar Remedies, as the precipitation of Patients to their extream Fate by the ordinary courses of Physick more than to the cruelty of their distempers, setting aside those frequent mistakes in discovering them and their causes; All which are so much subordinated to Natural Philosophy, that whatever rare Invention in Practice, or infallible distinction of any disease, is deprehended in the Art of Medicine, must be demonstrated by Principles of Physicks. Difficulties of Nature, that formerly seemed so uneasie to be explained, I find very obvious and evident through them; Many things that have hitherto lain hidden in the Bosome of Nature, and such, as no Philosophy could yet discover, you will meet with here. Besides these you are like to read the quotation of a Book of Souls or Psychelogia, formerly intending its insertion in the Second Part of Philosophy. But since I apprehend my self to be much scanted of my time, and that this Volumn would swell up into too great a mole, I am compelled to omit the publishing of it, although it hath been long since ready for the Press. Before I take my leave of my Reader, I must not forget to crave your permission of using some kind of terms in my Books, which although somewhat alienated from their proper signification, yet can give you a reason of their figurative or tropical acception, such are Catochization, Grove, besides many others. I must also acquit my self to you of my default in such plain and unpolisht Lines, which I have made use of; Certainly, whoever is acquainted with Philosophy will know, that it is Philosophical so to write; neither, had I been ingaged in any other Subject, could I have gratified your expectation herein, since it was never my fortune to Unnumbered page read two sheets of any English Book in my life, or ever to have had the view of so much as the Title Leaf of an English Grammar. I have also varied in the Orthography both of spelling and pointing from the ordinary, and so the Printer hath varied from me; My own part herein I can easily protect, and so I may the Printers, since his unacquaintedness with the matter and hand-writing, and the dazling of his eyes, (which a pair of Spectacles might easily have mended,) in the smalness of my Letters, hath set him upon the Lee shore of accurateness; however you may prevent the danger of some mistakes (although not of all, since I have not the opportunity of so much as casting a superficial eye over half this Volumn,) by directing your self to the Errata, which you will find set down at the end of each Book. In fine, not to detain you longer in preambles, I shall only commend to you one of Grave Cato's Distichs thus inverted, Non hos collaudes, nec eos culpaveris ipse, Hoc faciant stulti, quos gloria vexat inanis. Condemn thou none, neither give them praise, Let fools do so, who love peoples gaze. And advise you to suspend your Verdict upon these Writings, untill you have perused them twice, and then if disrelishing, dishering, false or contradicting to give your self the trouble of letting me know my errours in the sense of them, which, since my only scope is to promote Learning, to be taught my self, and to excite others to the study of things, that are yet imprisoned in darkness, I shall take for a very friendly office, not valuing the hearing or acknowledging my mistakes (although attended as usually with some reproof) provided, that at the same time I may be furnished Image 9 (unnumbered page) with better Principles in lieu of mine, or otherwise I shall think it much below me to take notice of such Scripts, intended for nothing more than Libels: Moreover, that my further duty may not prove a regret to me, the answering of such desires in Latine will obliege me to remain, Courteous Reader, Your humble Servant.   To Momus. THou cross-grain'd Mome, 'tis time forbear to squint, If not, I'll coin and cast thee in the Mint; Bodel be stamp a dog gnorring at a bone, More stupid, more dull than any dunghitl stone; If now thou shouldst grow civil, beyond what I can Hope, then thou art no more a beast, but a true man.

II. This name was politickly framed by Pythagoras, to cover the genuine and first denomination of  in non-Latin alphabet 	, and to hide its secrecy Image 28 (page 2) and excellence, the fame of which did attract so numerous a body of Contenders (who being ambitious to be renowned by the possession of it, before they had scarce made their first attempt, abusively stiled themselves ( in non-Latin alphabet 	) Wise-men) that through their multitude, they overclouded a few others, who might justly have challenged their title from it. Since then this new imposed word implied but little Fame or Worth, the greater part soon deserted it, whose eager pursuit being more after the shadow, than the thing it self, they freely resigned both to the real deservers thereof. III. Knowing nothing more certain, than that all, which we do enjoy, redounds to us by inheritance, we cannot doubt, but that Philosophy was also a Relict of the Forefathers, successively conveyed to us, who did attribute the original acquisition of it to the first man Adam: for he in his primitive and incorrupt state, being adorned with a full and perfect Knowledge of all Beings, it is probable, that after his Fall, he retained a measure of the same Knowledge; which, although being different from the former in perfection, yet by his industry had much promoted it, and so having committed it to the further accomplishment of his antediluvian Successors, to wit, Seth, Enos, Cainan, Malaleel, Jared, Enoch, Methusalem and Noe; it did attract such increase and degree of perfection from their experience that we have no great cause to admire, whence the profound Learning of the postdiluvian Fathers did arive to them; who were either sacred, as Abraham, Moses, Solomon, &c. or prophane, as the Magicians among the Persians, the Chaldeans of Babylon, Brachmans in India, the Priests of Egypt, the Talmudists and Cabbalists among the Jews, the Druids among the ancient Britains and Gauls, with whom many of the famous Poets, Homer, Hesiod, as also the seaven wise men of Greece were coetaneous; after which, Pythagoras flourished, who lived much about the time of Nebuchadnezzar, and spread his Doctrine throughout Italy, whence it was soon propagated through most parts of the world, and yet is over all the East-Indies. IV. As there was an apt capacity required in these lovers of wisdom to receive the Discipline of their Masters, so there was also necessary in them an indefatigable study, to add to the Inventions of their Predecessors, which to cherish and excite, they proposed the greatest pleasure and contentment of mind, thence undoubtedly Page 3 resulting to themselves (according to that trite Saying, Arduum quod pulchrum, That which is lovely, is hard to be attained unto) which did abundantly satisfie their labours. This is verified by the Relation, which the Mathematicians give of Archimedes, who was so much enamour'd with his Speculations, that at those times which most did dedicate to the rest of their minds, and intermission from their Studies, he was most busied in his thoughts; insomuch, that when for his healths sake, anoynting his body with Oyl (which was an ordinary Preservative in those dayes) he used to make Geometrical Figures with it upon his Breast, and other parts of his body, that so he might avoid the depriving of his Soul from one moments happiness, when he was inevitably forced to consult the safety of his Body. At another time sitting in a Bath, he observed the water to be much swelled through his immersion in it, collected thence a way, whereby to find a proportion of Silver to Gold, when both united in one Mass. This Contemplation did profuse such a joy in him, that he brake out into these words (Inveni, Inveni,) I have found, I have found: No less effect will it produce in us, when finding that in our nebulous state of Ignorance, which we lost in our perfect state of Knowledge, by falling from our Integrity. This seemeth incredible, unless attempted by the serious and diligent application of our minds to it. V. The Scales, whereby to weigh the worth of a thing, are frequently judged to be the Subject, wherein it is inherent, or the possessors of it, whose worth found, is the production of the worth of the thing proposed. The assent of this doth infer Philosophy to be the worthiest and most transcendent of all: For Kings and Princes, whose worth is not to be parallel'd to any but to themselves, have affected Philosophy, and preferred its worth above the esteem of all others. David and Solomon the greatest of Kings, extolled the Pleasure and Contentment flowing from their Contemplations, above them of Glory and Honour, and other secular Pleasures, which they enjoyed in greater measure, than any before or since. Ptolomy Philadelphus King of Africa, having weighed Triumphs, or the Glories following Conquests and Victories (which in their splendor do overtop all other kinds of Glories, and are reputed among the greatest of Contentments and Joyes) judged them to be more troublesom than pleasing: For he had observed them to have been attendants in their highest eminence to his late Predecessors Image 29 (page 4) Alexander the Great, and Ptolomy Lagus his Father, and that their Contentments and Joyes (supposed to slow thence) were subject to a continual Eclipse, through their immoderate aspiring to greater, and through every Alarum of an Enemy, and through the daily News of their revolting Subjects (although but lately vanquished) discomposing their Spirits: Wherefore he composed himself to a peace, and applied his mind to the study of Philosophy, which did so much cultivate his understanding, and please his thoughts, that he endeavoured to procure the helps of men most Renowned far and near, by an universal Invitation. VI. A man naked and unpolisht doth more resemble a Brute, than himself: What Proprieties are there in wild Beasts, but which you may find in West-Indians? I mean, those which are called  in non-Latin alphabet 	, or Men-eaters: They slay and devour one another; the shadow of each of them is a terrour to the other; nothing begetteth tameness in them, unless it be the presence of a Male with a Female, which the Instinct of Nature, and not their Reason, Hence Ovid, Ingenuas didicisse sideliter artes, Emollit mores, nec sinit esse feros doth compel them unto. Nothing different from these should we be, were it not, that Philosophy did rectifie and redintegrate our Understandings: To this we owe our right Reasoning, Morality, and Knowledge of all Natural and Supernatural Beings; and without that we are nothing else but Ignorance and Barbarism. A Divine will hardly reach to Theologick Vertues, unless he be first endowed with Morals: Neither is he like to compass the Knowledge of God, unless he first admireth him in his Creatures, and natural beings. Civilians (those who really merit that name) grow expert in composing Differences between others, by regulating Contentions arising between their own Soul and Body. A Physitian incurreth a suspition of being a Mountebank, or Astrologick Impostor, in case he be not more than ordinarily versed in Natural Philosophy, and questionless will be frustrated in his Cures, unless he be exactly skilful in knowing the proportion of Animal, Mineral, and Vegetable Natures to the Nature of man, which is demonstratively treated of in Natural Philosophy. To this doth the great Hippocrates in his Book of Elegance, elegantly exhort his Auditors:  in non-Latin alphabet 	. Wherefore we ought to apply Wisdom to the Art of Physick, and the Art of Physick again Page 5 to Wisdom: for a Physitian, who is a Philosopher, is like unto God.   CHAP. II. Of the Nature of Philosophy.   1. Whether Philosophy can be defined. 2. Various Definitions of Philosophy. How Plato did define it. The Definition of Damascen. 3. The Authors Definition of it. That the Essence of God is as sensibly apprehended as the Essence of his Creatures. 4. What is implyed by Knowledge. 5. The Subjectum circa quod, or Object of Philosophy. 6. The Subjectum Inhaesionis, or Subject wherein Philosophy is inherent.   MAny perswade themselves, that Philosophy doth not admit a Definition, that requiring an Unity in the Definitum, or thing Defined, which is not inherent in the Nature of Philosophy, but rather a Multiplicity; wherefore it can only be described. To the contrary, all Beings have an Unity: for (Ens & unum convertuntur) a Being and One are identificated: so that, whatever hath no unity, is no Being: But they granting Philosophy to be a Being, cannot deny it an Unity: and if it hath an unity, it is definible. A Being may be materially manifold, and yet formally one, and of that nature is Philosophy. Philosophy is a knowledge of Beings by their Causes, which is the Modus considerandi, or Ratio formalis of it, to wit, of Philosophy: But this is one. Beings, as they are the Materia, are many; nevertheless their universal Form in Philosophy is but one, which is to be known by their Causes. II. The Definitions of Philosophy are variously propounded by several Authors, who disagree more in terms and words, than in the thing it self. Others again, who seeming to define the Essence of a thing, rather describe it by its Properties and Effects: some of which serving to illustrate its Nature, I shall not think amiss to produce. Image 30 (page 6) Among these, that of Plato is most cried up.  in non-Latin alphabet 	. Philosophy is a Meditation upon death. This Meditation upon death, is that which goeth under the notion of a Platonick Extasie, which is nothing else, but a qualification requisite in a Philosopher, whereby he doth withdraw his thoughts from singular and material things, applying them to universal and immaterial beings: or whereby he inclineth his Reason to his Fancy, and diverteth his Mind from his senses: So that in this Rapture, a Philosopher hath his eyes open, and seeth not, and may be environed with Noyse, and hear not. Another Definition the said Divine Philosopher recommends, approaching somwhat nearer to its Essence. Philosophy is a likeness to God, in as much as it is possible for a man to be like to God. God is a Pattern to man in his actions according to the greatest perfection of vertue, and in speculation or knowledge of all natural and supernatural Beings, the habitual imitation of which is the true Philosophy. Damascen in his Dialect, Chap. 3. states this following Definition,  in non-Latin alphabet 	, Philosophy is the Art of Arts, and the Science of Sciences, and the beginning of all Arts; all which amounts to this: Philosophy is a comprehension of all Arts and Sciences. III. Philosophy is the knowledge of all cognoscible Beings. By Knowledge, understand a Habit of knowing a thing by its Definition or Essence, that is, by its internal and external Causes; namely, Matter, Form, and Efficient. By internal Cause, I intend a Principle through which a Being is constituted. Some beings having only a single internal Cause, as God and Angels are constituted by their Forms Take form in a large sense, as it doth imply an Essence or entire Being. without Matter, and for that reason are nominated Immaterial. Others are constituted through a double internal Principle, and from an efficient Cause; as all Natural Beings. Some obtain a single internal Principle, and one efficient Cause; as Angels. God only consisteth of a single internal Principle, which is his Form, which is that which he is: Hence God declares himself, I am who I am. Here may be offered an Objection, That God cannot be known by the same Ratio Formalis cognoscendi, as Naturals are, since that these are considered in a distinct manner in their Matter and Form, the existence of which is incurrent into our Senses: Wherefore the Essences of these we may perfectly apprehend. Page 7 On the other side, God is not known to us, unless indistinctly, and by his Attributes, not by his Essentials. My Answer to this, is, That our Knowledge of God is no less distinct, evident, and sensible (I term it sensible, because according to the Dogmatical Institutions of Aristotle, the Root and Evidence of our Knowledge is, and sloweth from our Senses) than of Naturals: and to speak truth, we neither understand certainly the Essence of God, nor of his Creatures, only their Existences, and other Accidents and Modes, under which the Peripateticks imagine the Essentials of a Being to be latent: So that only the  in non-Latin alphabet 	, and not the  in non-Latin alphabet 	, doth appear unto us. Whence my Inference is, that the Ratio Formalis of knowing immaterial and material Beings is the same, whereby we know the Essences of both in an equal manner. We doubt no less of the Being of God, than of the Being of his Creatures; because as we know these to have a Being and Essence by their sensible operations and effects (For Omne quod est, est propter operationem; All which is, or hath a being, is or hath it for an Operation) so we are also certain of the being and Essence of God by his Operation and Effects upon our Senses. We know that a material Substance consisteth of Matter, because we apprehend a trinal dimension of parts in it, which is an Accident concomitant to Matter, or rather Matter it self. We are also sensible of a Form inhering in that Matter through its Qualities and distinct moving. We gather from Experience, that (Nihil fit a seipso) no material Essence receiveth a Being from it self; but from an Efficient. By which three Causes a Natural Being is generated, and from them derives its Definition. In like manner do our Senses declare to us, that God's Nature is immaterial: For we cannot perceive a trinal dimension of Parts in him, only that he consisteth of a pute, single and formal Being, because we cannot but perceive his formal and spiritual Operations, and Effects upon all material Beings. Wherefore the Knowledge of God proveth no less evident to us, and in the same degree and manner of Perfection, then of Elementary and Created Substances. IV. Knowledge in the forementioned Definition doth equally imply a Practick and Theoretick Knowledge, the ground of which Division is founded upon the Matter and not the Form of Philosophy: so that according to the same sense, the understanding is called either Practick or Theoretick; not formally, as if the Understanding Image 31 (page 8) were twofold in man, but because it apprehendeth an object according to its double Representation of being Practical or Theoretical. V. Subjectum circa quod, or Object of Philosophy, are all Beings comprehending real and objective Beings, Essences, and their Modes, which latter are not specifically distinct from the former; but identificared, and considered here as real, notwithstanding partaking of a Modal Distinction; wherefore it makes no Formal Distinction in this universal Knowledge. In the like manner are the (Phaenomena) appearances in Astronomy supposed and taken for real, and move the understanding as distinctly, as if they were real Beings, strictly so termed, otherwise they could not be referred to a Science. VI. The Subjectum inhaesionis, or Subject wherein Philosophy is inherent, is the Understanding. The Understanding is either Divine, Angelical, Humane or Diabolical. In God Philosophy is Archetypick; in Angels and Men Ectypick; in Devils neither, they apprehending and discerning all things depravately and erroneously.   CHAP. III. Of Philosophers.   1. What a Philosopher is. Four Properties necessary in a Philosopher, That nothing is more hateful, and noysom than a man but half Learned. 2. The first Universities. The Rise and Number of Sects sprung from these Universities. The Fame of Socrates. 3. What Meanes Philosophers made use of to procure themselves a Repute and Fame.   I. A Philosopher, or a Wise man, is a great Artist, and allknowing: He is an Artist, in that he can direct all his Actions to a good and true end: and All-knowing, since there is nothing existent, but which he may know definitely. Wherefore  in non-Latin alphabet 	 is well derived from  in non-Latin alphabet 	, clear; because a Philosopher understandeth all things clearly, which condition makes up one of the Page 9 three Proprieties of a Philosopher, which are, 1. To know all things. 2. To have a capacity of teaching all which he knoweth. 3. To teach and divulge his Knowledge liberally (not for Loan, which is mercenary, and not suiting with the Dignity of a Philosopher) and freely. Scire tuum nihil est, nisite scire hoc sciat alter. Alas thy Knowledge is scarce worth a Pin, If thou keep secret what thou hast within. Hence slow these trite Sayings, Libere Philosophandum. Amicus Socrates, Amicus Plato, sed magis Amica Veritas. Non est jurandum in verba Magistri. We are to deliver Philosophy freely, that is, with a Socratick Liberty, or without adhering strictly to Authorities of Wise men, since that all men are subject to Errours, and the contrary of many of their Assertions are found to be true, we have cause enough to doubt of all, which they have commended to our Studies, and not to be tied, as if by Oath and Slavery, to believe our Masters words in every Tittle: an Abuse equal to Popery, enjoyning all men, upon danger of their Soules perdition, not to question the least Sillable of the Dictates of their Priests. It is no less Errour, to reject all which wise men have Published, their Works testifying their immense Parts and Abilities. So that our securest course is, to walk in the middle Path, and close with the Body of Philosophers in this Saying, Socrates is my good Friend, Plato is my good Friend, but the Truth is my best Friend. To which this doth also allude, Plato is ancient, but the Truth is more ancient. To these three, I will add a fourth; Philosophandum est, sed paucis. We are to prove our selves Philosophers in short, or in few words. This was one of the Famous Precepts of Ennius, whereby he reproved those disturbers of Learning, who through the abundance of their futil Arguments, aery words, and tedious Probo tibi's might have raised anger in Socrates himself, which disposition to nugation and pratling you cannot miss of in a man, who is but half Learned, who generally hath depravate Conceptions of most things which he meets withal. Such are they, who strive to defend and propagate most absurd and pseudodox Tenents, many of which do secretly contain Atheism: As Assertions of the Pre-existence of Souls; Multiplicity of worlds; the Souls being extraduce, and infinite others, which necessarily are Image 32 (page 10) Concomitants of these before-mentioned. In a word, Homine semidocto quid iniquius? what is there more detestable and hateful, than a man but half Learned? Which Apothegm may be justly transferred to a Physitian, Medico semiperito quid mortalius? what is more mortal than a Physitian but half experienced? II. The first Schooles of Fame, or Universities, where Philosophy was publickly and orderly teached, were two: The Italian and Ionick Schooles. The Italian or rather the Calabrian School was most renowned for Mathematicks, and Ethicks, where Pythagoras was Professor. In the Ionian School Natural Philosophy and Astronomy were most professed by Anaximander, a Scholar of Thales. The Italian University encreased in fame by breeding of Renowned Disciples: as Zeno, Democritus, Epicurus, and others. Anaximander's School was no less advanced by the Succession of Socrates, the Prince of Philosophers, and as the Oracle of Pythias stiles him,  in non-Latin alphabet 	, Socrates of all men the wisest. And to give him his due, he was the Ocean of all Humane and Divine Learning, out of which scattered these four Sects: Of Academicks, Cynicks, Peripateticks, and Stoicks; of whom may justly be pronounced, that whatever Truth they had retained in their Doctrine, it was derived from Divine Socrates; whatever Falshood they taught, was from their own Innovation, and depravate Judgment. The Academicks, so called from their abode at the Academy or University, next succeeded the doleful loss of great Socrates, whereby they were exposed to the Innovations and erroneous Opinions of Plato, an elder Scholar of Socrates. Plato having finished his Course of Philosophy by an untimely Death, put also a Period to the Sect, which his Doctrine had raised and fomented, and moved many to withdraw from the University, giving their minds to wandring, and divulging their Opinions or Dogmatical Dictates in their Travels: Among which Aristotle was most taken notice of, whose Scholars, to wit, which he had begot in his wandring, were thence called Peripateticks, or Wanderers, which name his Scholars still retained, although most of them received their Learning from him after his settlement in Lyceum, a School not far distant from Athens, or according to other, in Athens: The Scholars of greatest Note bred in Lyceum, were Theophrastus, who succeeded Aristotle, and Pyrrhon, the first Author of the Scepticks. The Cynicks were so called from their Master Cynosarges; whose Scholars were Diogenes the Page 11 Cynick, and Zeno; whose Disciples afterwards were called Stoicks; his Doctrine was for the most part Moral. To these may be added two Sects more, which these late years have produced, to wit, the Paracelsians and Cartesians. The Bombastin Sect derived their Name from their Master, Phil. Aur. Theophrast. Paracelsus, Bombast, born at Bohenheim, an obscure place in Germany, whose Doctrine treated most of Natural Philosophy, innovated by Principles drawn from the Fire; hence he and his Followers are called (Philosophi per Ignem) Philosophers through the Fire. 2. The Rotarians, or Cartesians, a Sect of the latest standing, reaped their Discipline from Ren. Des Cartes, a Frenchman, whose Study was most Mathematical and Physical, or rather a Mixture of a Pythagorean and Democritean Philosophy. III. The principal Means which each of these Grandees made use of to procure a Repute and Fame to themselves, were, Invections against their Masters Dictates, and phantastical Proposals of their own, dasht over with a multitude of apparent Reasons, and probable Arguments, wherein they did not only shew their Ingratitude and vain Ambition, but their Dishonesty to the world, by commending Falsehoods under the shape of apparent Truths, harnessed by their subtil Fallacies.   Image 33 (page 12) CHAP. IV. Of the Distribution of Philosophy in Parts.   1. In what manner Philosophy contains its subjected Parts. 2. How Objects move the Understanding by their first and immediate Representation. 3. That the Supreme and Immediate Division of Philosophy is in Practick and Theoretick Knowledge. 4. An Objection against the Subdivision of Practick and Theoretick Knowledge. 5. How Knowledge is subdivided. 6. That the Subdivision is adequate to all its Inferiour Parts. 7. Why Practick and Theoretick Philosophy are not treated of separately, as their Inferior Parts are. 8. That the Common Quadripartion of Philosophy is too strict.   I. PHilosophy hath been defined, and considered as a totum universalissimum, comprehending all Sciences, and Arts, as a (magis vel potius mexime universale) more universal, or rather a most universal, containeth (minus universalia) less universals: or also, as in the manner of an (totum Integrale) entire integral Being, a Countrey consisteth of Cities, and Cities of Streets, and Streets of singular Houses, so is the entire Body of Philosophy constituted by its contained Parts. II. The distinct Motion or Habit of an Object sub ratione universali formali, to the Understanding specifieth the kinds of Knowledges, an Object moves the Understanding (ut primum movens) through its first Motion in a twofold respect: 1. As it is good 2. As it is pleasant and admirable. As it is good, it excites a desire and appetite to it in the Intellect: For the understanding conceiving an Object to be good, in that it judgeth the Objects Convenience, and sutableness to it self, and is naturally carried forth to that Object, by which natural motion wrought first upon the animal Spirits in the Phansie, it moves the other Spirits lodging in Nerves throughout the Body, by drawing of them to that Object which it draweth it self unto; To which Attraction the other Spirits are naturally obedient, because they are a continuous Body, or Page 13 joyned in continuity, and in the strongest coherence unto the first moving Spirits of the Phansie; but of this more largely in its proper place. This motion of the Mind upon the Phansie, is called the Will. As it is pleasant and admirable, it moves the Understanding to its perserutation and Contemplation, in a double manner. 1. In a less universal, more concrete, and material manner, in which Representation it constitutes Physicks, or Natural Philosophy. 2. In a more universal, abstracted, and immaterial manner, which specifieth Metaphysicks. III. Whence we may gather the supreme and immediate division of Knowledge, as it is most universal, and is Philosophy it self, to be either Practick or Theoretick, because Practick and Theoretick are the first and immediate Habits or Respects of Objects, whereby they move the understanding. Practick Knowledge is, whereby the understanding is determined to Practise. Practise ( in non-Latin alphabet 	) denotech the production either of a fluent or permanent work: The production of a fluent work is called by the general name of Practise: The production of a permanent work  in non-Latin alphabet 	, or the making of a work. Theoretick Knowledge is, whereby the understanding is only moved to Contemplation, and is not determined to Practise. IV. Against this partition of Knowledge may be Objected; that Practise is not the Object of the understanding, but of the will, which by all Peripateticks is affirmed to be materially distinct from the Understanding: Wherefore Knowledge being the Object of the understanding, is only speculative, and in no wise practick. I grant the Premises, but deny the Syllogism, there being a Fallacia consequentiae hidden in it, or particularly there is more contained in the Conclusion, then was in the Premises. Wherefore I judge it strange, that they should really divide the Will from the understanding or Mind, which of its own nature is formally indivisible: So that the forementioned Objection doth not conclude any thing against my Assertion, since it infers not the will and understanding to be distinguished formally, but to differ only in matter, from which our division is prescinded. V. Practick Knowledge is divided in Logick, Moral Philosophy, and the Art of Nature, whereby she is helped, and may otherwise be called the Art of Physick in a large sence: These tripartited Image 34 (page 14) Parts being less universal, and less mediate, are drawn from a triple end or effect of Philosophy, determined by a triple Object. 1. The Soul. 2. The Body. 3. The Manners. The end of Philosophy upon the Soul is to help it in its Defect, consisting in its subjection to Errours, which constitutes Logick. The effect of Philosophy upon the Body is to relieve its Defects, consisting in nakedness, want of Conveniences, and subjection to Diseases. To this the Art of Physick prescribes Remedies and Helps. 3. The Effect of Philosophy upon the Manners (which are actions produced by Soul and Body joyned in unity) is to regulate them in their Extravagancies and Depravations, which specifieth Moral Philosophy: Note that Logick and Moral Philosophy are here taken in their largest signification. Theoretick Knowledge is divided according to the universal formality (I mean Formality in respect to one another of the subdivided Members, and not to Philosophy it self, to which these are only material Subdivisions) of the speculative Object; which is threefold. 1. A Material Object inherent in material Essences, which limits it to Natural Philosophy. 2. An Immaterial Object depending from immaterial Beings, which determines it to Pneumatology. 3. An Object communicable to both, or abstracted from each, which is a Being in general as it is communicable to material and immaterial Objects, which constitutes the Subject of Metaphysicks. VI. All inferiour and less universal Knowledges must be comprehended in some one of the divided Members of Philosophy, otherwise it would be an erroneous Distribution: wherefore some of the Liberal Arts, as Arithmetick, Grammar, Rhetorick, are reduced to the Art of Logick, as it is taken in a large sense, implying a Habit of guiding Reason being defective in its Judgment, and in Elocution or Utterance. The Arts of Musick, Geometry, Astrology are comprehended in the Art of Nature, as also the Art of Physick, strictly so called, and the servile Arts, as the Art of Husbandry, of Weaving, of Warring, &c. Likewise are Oeconomicks and Politicks referred to Moral Philosophy; Astronomy to Natural Philosophy. VII. The most universal parts of Philosophy, namely Theoretick and Practick, are treated of inclusively, as far as their Inferior Parts do contain them: So that thereby Authors save the labour Page 15 of discoursing of them separately, and of repeating the same Matters in vain. Nevertheless was that Partition necessary, because through it Philosophy is contracted to its less universal Parts. VIII. The common quadripartited distribution of Philosophy is too strict, the subjected Members exceeding its extention; for example, to what part of Philosophy will you reduce the Art of Medicine? possibly you may refer it to Natural Philosophy, which may not be, because the one is practick, and the other speculative. The like Question may be demanded concerning all the Servile and Liberal Arts: Wherefore it was requisite to add the Art of Nature to the practick Knowledges. Pneumatology hath been abusively treated of in Metaphysicks, because its Object, namely, Spirits, is more contracted, then a Being in general; If you answer, that it is a part dividing a Being in general, and therefore it ought to be reduced to its whole; then by vertue of that Argument, Natural Philosophy ought to be referred to the same Science, because that is the other opposite dividing part; for a Being in Metaphysicks is treated of, as it is abstracted from a Material and Immaterial Substance.   CHAP. V.   1. What Method is requisite in the Ordering of the particular Treatises of the several Parts of Philosophy. 2. What Order is observed in the Placing of the General Parts of Philosophy.   I. THe Method requisite in the Ordering of the particular Treatises of the several Parts of Philosophy is not indifferent, most preferring a Synthetick in Theoretick, and an Analytick Method in Practick Knowledges, all excluding an Arbitrary Method in matters necessary, and such are Philosophick II. The Order observed in the placing of the General Parts of Philosophy, is drawn from their Dignity, or primality of Existence. If from their Dignity, Pneumatology is the first, because of its most excellent Object. The next Metaphysicks, because of its most general Object. Moral Philosophy is the first, in respect of time, because our Will is the first Faculty we exercise next after our Production, Image 35 (page 16) whose first act is, to incline a Child to suck, which being subject to be immoderate in it, is learned by use and direction of its Nurse, to be better regulated in its appetite, and to know the Rule of Temperance; Hence it is an universal saying, Disciplinae fuerunt prius in usu quam in arte, Disciplines were in use before they were in art. The Will being the first, which required the help of Prudence, and Moral Philosophy, was the only cause which moved Socrates to teach Morals first, and not because the Science of Physicks were, or seemed to be obscure, and hard to be known: for even in them he was more skilful and learned than any ever was among the Heathens. The first in Nature and respect to Knowledge, is Metaphysicks, comprehending all the others in it self. The first quoad nos, is Logick, which doth dispose our understanding for the Discipline of the other parts. Each of these Parts obtain a distinct consideration. Metaphysicks are considered as abstracted, and Immaterial, that is, most remote from Singulars; not properly immaterial, as a Spirit, but as inherent in its less universals, and by contraction may be material. Physicks are considered as a less universal, and nearest to Singulars, which by their common habit and Representation, exhibit a common unity, which constitutes a less universal; wherefore whatever cannot be proved by experience, that is, by our Senses, to be existent in Singulars, makes an Opinion, or Errour in the universals: So that the proof of Pneumatology, as well as of Natural Philosophy, depends from our Senses, and experience in Singulars. Wherefore every Philosopher ought to make probation of all Assertions, in whatever part of Philosophy it be, by Arguments drawn either mediately or immediately from Singulars, and especially in Natural Philosophy; which way of Arguing produceth a Certainty and Evidence or Demonstration.    Page 17 Metaphysicks. The Second Book:  CHAP. I. Of the Nature of Metaphysicks.   1. Of the Etymology and Synonima's of Metaphysicks. 2. The Authors Definition of Metaphysicks. That a Being is univocal to an objective and a real Being. 3. The true formal and adequate Object of Metaphysicks. 4. Wherein Metaphysicks differs from Philosophy.   IT will be needless to propound any thing further concerning the antiquity, worth, and pleasure of the study of Metaphysicks, since you may justly apply the general fruits and ends of Philosophy to it in particular, wherefore I proceed to what is more requisite. I. Metaphysicks was so called from its Etymology out of  in non-Latin alphabet 	 above, and  in non-Latin alphabet 	, Physicks, which in composition imply as much as a knowledge above Physicks, and from its transcendence it appropriates to it self the most transcendent name of the whole, namely, Wisdom, or a universal Knowledge, which it retains, although improperly; because it is next compared in universality to Philosophy. It is called also the first Philosophy, from its nearest approximation to Philosophy, Image 36 (page 18) its most proper Denomination is Ontology, or a Discourse of a Being. Metaphysicks is a Knowledge of a most universal Being. Knowledge imports the unfolding of a thing by its Causes, Effects, Proprieties and Affections. By a most universal Being understand, a Being abstracted from more universal, and mediately from less universal, material and immaterial Beings, prescinded from real (strictly so termed) and objective Beings, or from real and modal Beings, to all which a Being in general is a Genus univocum: For were they not univocal Parts of a Being in general, they could not be treated of (per se) in this Science, but per accidens, which is erroneous. But suppose I granted that modal or objective Beings had their places here per accidens, to what Science are they then referred per se? For as they are cognoscible, they come under the Notion of Philosophy, and have a distinct Unity and Essence, which must be considered per se in some part or other of Philosophy. Since then they cannot be reduced per se to any Form else, their proper place must be here. I prove that a Being in general, as it is the Subject of Metaphysicks, is a Genus univocum to an (ens rationis) Objective Being, and a (Ens Reale) real Being. All Beings are capable of being the Subject of Philosophy, so far as they are cognoscible only; not as they are real Essences, but as they really move the understanding to their knowledge: This is evident hence, (Quicquid recipitur, recipitur per modum recipientis,) because knowledge in the understanding ariseth from the knowledge in the senses; and the senses know objects by their distinct moving of the sensories; the understanding by being moved by the sensories; wherefore the understanding, which is the Subject of Philosophy, knoweth no things further, than it is moved by the internal and external senses. A Genus univocum is, which is equally constituted by its Species; that is, at the same time, and in an equal manner. Univocal Species are, which constitute a Genus equally. This premised, I frame my Argument thus; An objective Being, and a real Being do equally constitute an universal cognoscible Being. Ergo, they are univocal Parts. I confirm the Antecedent. An Objective Being doth as By really understand effectively & properly. really move the understanding, as a Real Being: Ergo, they are equally cognoscible Beings: So that an Objective Being is neither more or less a cognoscible being, than a Real being, and as to the understanding, Page 19 they are formally one, differing only materially. If two different Essences were reduced to one Science, to wit, one per se, the other per accidens, they would constitute a formal difference in a Science, and cause a duplicity in it, which should be but one. III. The Object of this Science is a Being, as it hath a cognoscible Essence; so that whatever hath no cognoscible being, is excluded without its denomination: Wherefore a non ens reale (excusing the Impropriety of speech) or that, which hath no real being or existence, may be cognoscible, provided it hath but an objective being. So a possible being, which is a non ens reale may be concelved to be an ens rationis. But for a (non ens objectivum) a being, that hath no objective existence, that hath no being, and is impossible, neither can it any wise be positively considered. IV. A Being here is conceived, as it is a most universal being, and abstracted from its more and less universals; herein it differeth from Philosophy, the formal Object of which is taken for a being as it is a most more and less universal being, prescinded from Practical and Theoretick beings, and treating of them in their most, more, and less universalities: whereas a being in Metaphysicks, is also a most universal being, abstracted from more and less universals, but treating of it only, as it is most universal.   CHAP. II. Of Precision.   1. What Precision is. 2. That a real Precision is not properly a Precision. 3. That Precision constitutes a Positive and Negative. 4. The Difference of Precision. That all Precisions are formal.   I. PRecision is an operation of the mind, whereby in distinguishing the Parts of a being from one another, we do apprehend them, which really cannot exist asunder, as existing separately in our minds, in such a manner, as if they were really existent out of our understandings: For example, a singular Blackness in an AEthiopian, although it cannor exist really out of that AEthiopian, yet we may conceive that blackness by it self in our minds, and the AEthiopian Image 37 (page 20) by himself, as if they were really and separately existent. II. Hence it followes, that properly there is no real Precision or Abstraction, as Authors generally have imagined; for that which was really distinct from another, is so (according to their Doctrine) without the operation of the understanding, and therefore it is no precision; because a precision is an operation of the mind. Where observe, that this precision superaddeth nothing to the (Ratio formalis intelligendi) to the understanding, but to the thing understood, or matter intelligible. Wherefore objective and modal beings are made equal objects to real beings by the forementioned precision, and move the understanding as properly as real beings. III. A Precision constitutes a Positive and a Negative: A positive unity, and a negative distinction. That same unity is not a non ens: wherefore the Negative, which is concomitant to all precisions, is not understood by us, only we judge by experience, that one being hath but one unity, and spying a being, we judge, that that being hath unity, and therefore is not a non ens. The difference arising between two real beings or essences is simpliciter called a distinction: the difference between a real being, and its Mode, or Habit, or Representation, is a formal precision: So that all precisions are formal. I call it formal, because we give it a distinct Definition, which is the Form of a being: as in an AEthiopian, we precind his blackness from his Humanity, and define it a colour, which doth concentrate our sight; his Humanity to be a rational living substance. Which beings are formally distinct from one another, because they have distinct Definitions. IV. A Formal precision is either really modal or objectively modal. A real modal precision is whereby an accident is precinded from a real Essence. An objective modal precision is, whereby an accident is abstracted from an objective being; an objective being is that, which doth not exist really, but in the mind only, although it is grounded upon a real being. That, which is called a formal precision of beings in the understanding, is termed a real distinction in real beings, which are not distinguisht from one another without the operation of the understanding, for it is our understanding perswades us that they are distinguisht really from one another.   Page 21 CHAP. III. The Manner of Precision.   1. How a more universal Being is precinded from its less universal Beings. 2. How an universal Being is equally abstracted from an (ens Rationis) Objective Being, and (ens reale) a real Being. 3. How a common Concept is precinded from a Substance and Accident.   A Being in its greater universality is precinded from beings in their less universality; when we conceive a common representation to two or more less universalities, & apprehend them united in that commonness, and distinct from each less universal, from which it was abstracted; for example, an immaterial and material Being have each an Essence: in that, they have each an essence, they are like to another, and constitute a commonness, this commonness abstracted from each, and distinguisht from their materiality and immateriality is the formal precision of a being in its greater universality. The same Rule is also held in abstracting a common Concept from an (ens rationis) objective being, and a real being; each of them having a commonness in their essence, which is, in that they move the understanding, although one existeth really without the understanding, the other only in the active understanding: the abstracting of this commonness from the objectiveness, and reality constitutes a precinded unity of an ens rationis, and an ens reale. In the like manner is a common concept precinded from an accident and substance, each of these having a commonness of moving the understanding, which abstracted from their realities, precindes a more universal unity from each. Note that the Doctrine of precision doth not properly belong to this place, which notwithstanding I thought good to insert, for to explain the specification of the Subject of Metaphysicks; namely, how a being in its greater universality is abstracted from its lesser universalities: how it is univocal to an objective and real being; to a substantial and accidental Image 38 (page 22) being; to a material and immaterial Essence; and summarly, how that a being precinded in the forementioned manners, and univocal to every one of them beings, is specified to the Subject of this Science.   CHAP. IV. Of the Definition of a Being.   1. What the proper name of the Nature of a Being is. The improbation of several Definitions of a Being. 2. Objections against the common Definition of a Being received by most late Philosophers. 3. That there is no common Concept to a possible real Being, and an actual real Being. 4. That there is an univocal Concept to all immaterial and material, Objective and Real, Substantial and Accidental Beings. 5. The Authors Definition of a Being. That our Knowledge is comparatively as perfect as Adams was.   THe Quiddity of a Being in general goeth more by the name of the Concept of a Being, that is, as it is a conceived being, or as it is an Object of our Knowledge, than the Nature and Formality of a being; and that justly and properly, because a being is a being (as to us) only from being conceived by us, that is, from its cognoscibility. As the common name imposed upon the Quiddity of a Being is very proper, no less improper are the common Definitions of it, as they are rendred by most Aristotelian Commentators: Whereof some proposed this Definition: A Being is that, which is not nothing; or (according to others) which is no Chimaera. The first is not so much as a Description, which is cognoscible, but nothing is not cognoscible per se, but per aliud, to wit, by a being; if so, then a being is apprehended by a no-Being, and a no-being by a being, which runs in a blind circle, like a Horse goes round in a Mill. The latter Definition is a Description of a Real Being, and is not freed from all Objections: 1. It is described by a Negative. 2. All that, which is no Chimaera, is not a real being: for a Hircocerous is Page 23 no Chimaera. But possibly by Chimaera is meant an ens rationis, in a larger sense; which although granted, yet there are beings, which are neither strictly an objective being, neither in the same extent a real being; such are all modal beings, which are distinguisht from a real being, as parts from their whole. II. This Definition is more generally received by most latter Philosophers. A Being is, which hath an aptitude to exist; or to which existence is possible. This Definition is also involved in scruples and repugnances: for here a possible being is only described, and not an actual being; wherefore it is not a general Definition of a being. Others, to clear that Objection, proposed the same Definition with a Tayle to it. A Being is, which hath an aptitude to exist, or is that, which doth exist. This is a plain division of a being existent, and possible to exist; Where halts the Definition then? 2. Essence is nearer to a being than Existence; wherefore illegally defined. 3. That which hath an aptitude to exist, is no real being, because it hath no real Essence, not cognoscibility from without. 4. It is too strict: for it doth not comprehend an objective being; wherefore we have occasion enough to doubt of the whole dispute of Smiglecius De ente rationis, since that he proceeds upon a Definition falsly supposed, and defined by existence, which is only a mode of a Being. III. There is no common concept to a possible real being, and an actual real being; because the one is a Negative, the other a Positive, which being contrary, cannot constitute an unity, which is an effect of similitude, or commonness of Concept. A possible being is a Negative; because it is that, which is no real being in a strict sense: For real in a large sense, is taken, for whatever doth move the Understanding. Neither can I apprehend, how a possible being may be called real, according to the ordinary acception; which imports real to be that which doth exist without the understanding; wherefore that which doth not exist, but only can exist, is not real. And this is past mending, notwithstanding the enlarging of it thus. Real is that, which is, or can exist without the Understanding. To define two formal Natures in one Definition, is absurd. For that which is, is one Formality, that which is not, but supposed to be in the Divine Idea, is another Formality. That these two are Contraries, is evident: because that, which is, we may perceive by our senses, that, which is not, but can be, or is in the Image 39 (page 24) Divine Idea, we can neither perceive by our senses, or understanding. Lastly, Possibility relates to Existence, and therefore (if granted) it would be but an accidental Definition, or rather a Division. IV. That there is a common and univocal Concept of God, and his cteatures, of accidents and substances, of objective and real being (ex parte Actus) in the understanding, is sufficiently proved, by supposing certainly, that God is as sensibly known by us, as his Creatures are, and consequently the Concept in the understanding may be univocal; that Accidents and Substances differ modally: And, that an Objective Being is as much a being to us, as a real being; all which hath been demonstratively proved in the precedent Chapters. Besides, the manner of Precision, which is the ground of an univocal Concept, I have so plainly and briefly set down in the two Chapters of Precision, that you have thence an easie entrance, to go through all the difficulries of Metaphysicks (which arise from an omission of an exact Explication of Precision) and to understand with more ease the subtilities of Suares, Arriaga and Oviedo, than they can understand themselves, and dissolve all Objections against the univocal Concept of the forementioned beings. V. A Being is that, which hath an Essence; not that which can have an Essence; for it hath none. To have an Essence, is to be existent; to be existent, is to have an Essence, which Reciprocation is not the same, that hapneth to Synonima's, but to a Formality, and its propriety; so that existence is not really distinct from Essence, but only modally. An Essence is that, whereby a being is cognoscible to be that, which it is. Where observe, that as to us, cognoscibility is necessary and formal to a being; for a being, as to us, is no being, unless it be cognoscible. Notwithstanding this relative Essence, we do grant an absolute or fundamental Nature, whereon this relative Essence of a being is grounded. That which man never perceived by his senses, or like to any thing, which hath been perceived by him, is no being, neither objective or real. This I prove; whatever we can say is real, can be perceived by cur senses (or otherwise, how could we say it were real; for saying proceeds from our Knowledge, and our Knowledge from our Senses) and whatever is perceived by our senses, is real, that is, is existent from without. Ergo, There is no real thing, but it is perceptible by our Senses, mediately or immediately, and consequently as to us, is real from its cognoscibility. You may object, Page 25 that there are many Beings existent, which an individual man cannot perceive: Ergo, by that they should not be real. I answer, That Man is taken here in the universal, for the plurality of men, and therefore I added, by our Senses; so that whatever man in general is not capable of knowing, it is a non ens; for otherwise, if any thing should be said to be real, and no man could perceive it, or did ever perceive it, we should say a most palpable untruth, which another would reply unto, that it was no being: because no man ever saw any such thing, or did ever hear of it. 2. According to the Supposition of the Objector, the material beings, which we may imagine to be existent without the tenth or eleventh Orb, are real; which all confess to be imaginary, and therefore not real. It is certain, that whatever is cognoscible to man, is a being; but whether a being may not be somthing beyond what is cognoscible, is a doubt. 2. The Subjectum in quo of cognoscibility (viz. Man) is differing from himself now to what he was before his Fall, and therefore he apprehending a being then further and beyond what man doth apprehend it now, seems to alter the formality of a being, which should be inalterable: Yea, let us go on and question, whether Angels do not know a thing beyond what may be perceptible to man? If they do, then beyond all Opinion, Cognoscibility in man is not the Formality of a being. To Answer to all these, we must state, that a being is that, for which it is known to be: For it is impossible to imagine, that a being should be any thing else, as to a Rational Creature, but what it may be apprehended by him to be; supposing a man to know certainly what a Colour, Smell or any thing else is in it self, that thing, as to, or in that man, can be nothing but what he knowes it to be: or asking a man, what such a thing is, he will answer you, it is such a thing, that is, he apprehends it so to be. Again, Suppose an Angel told you, such a thing is such; this is no otherwise, than that he knows it to be such or such. I might almost state the same Case of God, but fearing I should offend, I rather omit it. Supposing then that that, which is cognoscible to man, is a being, I do affirm, that an infinite being, as far as it is cognoscible to man, is a Being, and is perceived by him to be a Being; but since that being is not terminated in mans Knowledge, he cannot out of consequence but think and believe, that that being is indeterminate, or at least is more than he knows or is capable of knowing, so that this is a very palpable ground to man, to induce him to believe (for Image 40 (page 26) know it he cannot, since it is beyond his Knowledge, and therefore must believe it, which is an assent beyond Knowledge) that God is a being, because he knows him to be a being, and that he is infinite, or indeterminate, because he is not terminated within his Knowledge, and because God declares the same of himself; wherefore it is well said, that we know God partly only, and as through a Glass. Herein is an infinite being distinguisht, and we know it to be distinguisht from a non ens, which is also (although improperly) termed Infinite, because we know a part of the former, but no part of the latter, and therefore we conclude the one to be somthing beyond what we know it to be, and the other to be nothing beyond what we know it not to be. Finite things, as far as they are cognoscible, are nothing beyond what they are cognoscible, and although one man may erre in his Knowledge, yet the universality of men, it is probable, do not, especially in immediately sensible Objects. In relation to the second doubt and Objection, I affirm, that man in his present state, cannot discern the Essence and Modes of a being so clearly at once, so swiftly, so certainly, and so easily as man did before his Fall, because of the depravate and contrary Habit, since befallen to man; nevertheless his Principle of Knowledge is the same, and may through it perceive, and know the same things, and in the same degree, although with subjection to Errour, Difficulty, by length of time, Study and Experience. Wherefore if Adam knew all things as they were (as doubtless he did) and that cognoscibility of beings in him, were their formality, as to him, certainly the same cognoscibility must be their formality as to us. I could render this point much clearer, but this may suffice to an attentive mind, and therefore shall spend no more Time or Paper about it, deferring it until such time, which I may happily employ for the answering of such Objections, that probably others will make against it. Hence we collect one member of the division of a Being, namely a Real being, which is that, which our understanding doth apprehend to exist without, in the same manner as it doth apprehend it within.   Page 27 CHAP. V. Of the Formality of an Objective Being.   1. The Authors Definition of a (Ens Rationis) Being of the Mind, or an Objective Being. Wherein a Real Being differs and agrees with an Objective Being. 2. The Proof of the fore-given Definition. That whatever we think, when we do not think upon a Real Being, is an Objective Being. That whatever we think or can think, when we do not think upon a Real Being, is like to a Real Being. 3. Another Argument to prove the Formality of a mental being to consist in likeness to a Real Being. 4. The Division of an Objective Being.   1. THat, which a man doth apprehend to be like to what he perceives by his senses, is an (Ens Rationis) objective being, which is like to some one, or more real Beings. And this makes the other opposite dividing Member of a (Ens) Being in general. An Ens Rationis or an objective being, is that, whose essence existing in the mind only, consisteth in a likeness to a real being. That an Objective being as to us, is as much a being, as a real being, it appeares hence, because a being, like to another being, is as much cognoscible in its existence, and other modes or Accidents, as a real being, to which it may be like. It is called objective, because its essence is immediately grounded upon the passive and active Intellect, which gives it to be objective or representing: So that you may observe, that the sorce of the word objective, doth confirm the truth of my Definition, which is, that an objective being is, which represents a real being, or is like to a real being. Likeness doth not imply a single or immediate Idea in the active Intellect; for that is only proper to real beings, but a reflexe or double Idea, or the framing of another Idea, like to the single Idea of a Real being. A being conceived to be like to a real being, is partly different from it, and partly the same with it. It is the same with it, or identificated in their superiour gender, which is a being. It is different, Image 41 (page 28) in that it moves the passive understanding differently from a real being, that moving the understanding by its present motion through and from it self: whereas it self moveth the passive understanding through its intelligibility or internal cognoscibility, which it hath in the active Intellect. This Intelligibility is nothing else but the same Idea of a real being, conceived again in the absence of that real being, which made that first Idea by its own present motion in the understanding: In a word, it is not else, but a Recordation of a real being; and a real being it self is nothing else, but a being apt to move the senses by its own single and present Motion. II. I prove the fore-stated Definition of an Objective being to be adequate to its Essentials. If whatever we think or can think, be only like to a Real being, and that at such times, when we are not employed in understanding a Real being, is no real being; that Concept must be of an Ens Rationis, or Objective being: But what ever we think, or can think, is like to a real being, and that, at such times when we are not employed in understanding a real being, is no real being; Ergo, whatever we think, or can think to be like to a real being, and that at such times when we are not employed in understanding a real being, must be a Concept of an Ens Rationis, or Objective being. I confirm the Major Proposition, which cortaines an Argument a necessario. The Necessity flowes from a Maxime, which is that an Objective Being and real being are contradictorily opposite; and between Contradictories there is no Mean or Medium. But of this more hereafter. I prove the Minor, which is, that all which we think, or can think is like to a real being, at such times when we are not employed in understanding a real being. Stop your ears, and shut your eyes, or compose your self to a Platonick Extasie, and try, whether you can think of one or more beings, which is, or are not like to a real being or beings; let that thought be of a being most impossible to exist really. I am certain, I could never. You will say, that you can think of an Atlas, or a man holding the world upon his back: I grant, that an Atlas is an Ens Rationis; but this Ens Rationis is like to a real being: Namely, the man is like to a man, the world like to a Globe? had we never seen a Globe, or a man, we could never have thought upon them joyntly: so is a Hirco-cervus, a Goatstagge, an objective being, representing a Goat and a Stagge. This Page 29 Axiome doth also infer the same; Nihil est in Intellectus, quin prius fuerit in sensu; there is nothing in the understanding, but it proceeds from our senses. If then we know nothing, but that, which we receive from our sensation, and the Knowledge in the understanding is nothing, but a Representation of what is recommended to it by the Senses, that which we alwaies think, or can think, must be like, or must represent a real being; because we perceive nothing, but what is really existent without the understanding. Here may be Objected, that then all real beings are objective beings; because all real beings cause a Representation or Likeness to themselves in the understanding. The Solution is easie. In a large sense all real beings are objective, if objective be taken largely, for that which moveth the understanding, as Smilec. also, Disp. 1. Q. 1. well observes, Non quaecun{que} existentia objectiva sufficit ad Ens Rationis; Nam etiam entia realia existunt objective in intellectu. It is not every objective existence doth suffice to constitute an objective being; for real beings exist also objectively in the understanding. So that I say, that it is not every Likeness in the understanding specifieth an objective being, but only a mediate and reflexe Likeness, which is formed out of the immediate or direct Likeness or Idea of a real being, by abstracting another or mediate Likeness from that first likeness. The likeness of a real being is immediate, and therefore needs its own real presence to impress this likeness upon the understanding; whereas the likeness of an Objective being is formed mediately from the first real likeness (as I may call it) and is abstracted, when the real Object is absent, that is, at such a time (as I inserted above) when we are not employed in the understanding of a real likeness. I call it a reflexe likeness, because the understanding doth abstract it by a reflexe action upon it self. Neither is that first or immediate likeness of a real being properly a likeness, but rather an Impression made by its presential action; whereas a likeness is properly that, which is abstracted from the Impression already made by a real being, and in the absence of it, that is, when we are not employed in the understanding of a real being. So that a proper likeness is between two beings, formally different from one another. I will illustrate this by an example: Frame a Likeness upon an Impression of a real being: as of a Dog; as long as that Impression lasteth, you cannot make a Likeness upon it; for we can exercise but one act of the understanding faculty at once; Image 42 (page 30) For one formal power exerciseth but one formal act. It is then necessary that the Impression should be finished, by the cessation of the alteration of that real being upon the Sensories (which I call the absence of a real being, a parte rei, or the intermission of understanding a real being a parte actus Intellectus.) The Impression being finisht by the absence of that real being, namely, of the Dog, the understanding by a reflexe and mediate Likeness upon that Impression, may by another action relate that likeness abstracted from that Impression to that same Dog again (which action is a distinct operation of the mind, formally differing from that first action of receiving an Impression) and so that Dog framed in the understanding is like to the first Impression of that real Dog again. Where observe, that this Likeness is not the same Impression, which that Dog made upon the Sensories, but a being abstracted in the passive understanding, by the Active, of the same likeness to that same Impression. III. Another Argument to prove the formality of an Objective being to consist in a likeness to a real being, is this. As Beasts and Men are formally distinct in their Essence, so also they are formally distinct in their formal Operations. Hence I proceed thus. The perceiving of a real being is proper to a Beast, the perceiving of an objective being is only proper unto men. Wherefore as them two operations are formally different, so are their Acts, which is the perceiving of a real being, and of a formal being, and consequently, an Objective being doth differ from a real being. These Operations being supposed to be formally different, I say, that that which makes them formally different, is the Ratio formalis of each. That which argues or makes a being to be real, is its perception by the animal Senses. This is evident, because Beasts, who do perceive and discern real beings (for they discern Grass from water, their own Stable from another) which they cannot perceive, but by their senses: Ergo, the perception by animal sense is the Ratio formalis of a real being. That which makes an Objective being, is that, whereby a man is distinct from a Beast, which is a power of framing likenesses by a reflexion upon the Animal perception or Impression, and is an act whereby a man is formally distinct from a Beast: For a Beast cannot frame any Likeness: Ergo, The Formality of an Objective being doth consist in a Likeness to a Real being. You may Object, that you can apprehend a being existing in your Page 31 mind, to be a real being: Ergo, Whatever is thought, is not thought to be like to a real being, but somthing may be thought to be a real being. I Answer, That that, which you think to be a real being, you think it to be like to a real being, and because of that, you say it is a real being: For example, Suppose you think the Pope to be a real man, your thinking of him to be so, is nothing else, but your thinking him to be like to a man, and therefore you say he is a man. Moreover, although an objective being consisteth in a likeness to a real being, the Conclusion thence is not, that that which is an objective being, is no real being, that is, that hath no real being for its foundation: for the definition doth imply it: neither are you to conclude, that an objective being is a contradictorily opposite to a real being: that is, that an objective being doth not respond to a real being, because a real being doth not exist in that manner of conjunction, as an objective being is somtime conceived, viz. a Dog-cat is an Ens Rationis: now the apprehending of these both together, that is, one a top the other, doth not make them formally and essentially distinct from each other, supposing them to be conceived distinctly; for that is but accidental to them, and in effect, they are conceived distinctly in the same manner, as I have declared in the Sixth Chapter. This then being granted to be accidental to an Objective being, we must necessarily suppose each of them singly (viz. the Dog and the Cat) existing at present only in the understanding, to be an objective being: What, will you call them beings real beings, which now, are existent only in your understanding, and cannot move your cognoscible faculty really from without at the same time, when you know them from within? Further, supposing, that each Component of a compounded ens rationis, is an Ens Rationis (as formally it is, for how can a whole compounded ens rationis be said to be an whole Ens Rationis, unless its parts are likewise Entia Rationis? (Nihil est in effectu, quin prius suerit in causis) there is nothing contained in the effect, but what was before existent in its Causes, and such as the effect is, such must the Cause have been) it is impossible, that you can think or conceive any such components, but which are respondable to a real being. Neither is it proper to call that being, which you have conceived in your mind, to be like to a real being, although that real being be before you, a real being, because now it is objective, and existent in the active Intellect, moving the passive Intellect actually: But in case you Image 43 (page 32) leave that Objective being, and reflect your senses to that same being which is before, then that being, which doth now move your sensual cognoscibility, is said to be a real being. But here you may say, that an objective being is formally different from a real being, wherefore an Objective being ought not so much as to have a power of existing really, which according to this Discourse it hath, and therefore the fore-stated Definition of an Objective is not to be allowed. I Answer, That an Objective being is formally different from a real being, and is impossible ever to be formally a real being: For, in that I assert a being to be Objective, I assert that it is not real, neither can an Objective being quatenus objective, be real, quatenus real. Lastly, Is a Mule more or less an ens rationis, because it is generated from different Species, or constituted in unity by part"" of a different Species? Certainly no. So"

Image 2 (unnumbered page) Page 1 SIR, THERE came lately to my hands since I came to this place a Discourse stiled the Examination of Accademies, (which I herewith send you) It pretends to the reforming of Publick Schooles, and the promoting of all kind of science. I must confesse my selfe at first sight, very much pleased with the undertakeing, as being suitable to my owne frequent wishes, and what I conceived might with some reason be hoped for in this inquisitive age. And therefore I came to the reading of it, with great expectations of finding somewhat answerable to the noblenesse of the attempt. But I quickly discovered, that I was like to be much disappointed in that hope, & that besides a Torrent of affected insignificant tautologies with some peevish unworthy reflections, & the repetitions of some old & trite cavills, together with severall bundles of grosse mistaks there was litle else to be expected from this Author. Two grand incapacityes for such a worke, he quickly discovers himselfe guilty of, that are not to be pardoned or excused in such an undertaker. 1.

He supposes and takes it for granted, that they are so tyed up to the Dictates of Aristotle, that whatsoeuer is taught either against or besides him by way of refutation or supply, they do by no meanes admit of, so much as to any consideration or debate, but are wholy ignorant of it. Which is so notoriously false, that I should very much wonder Image 3 (page 2) with what confidence he could suppose it, if I did not finde Mr Hobbs likewise guilty of the same mistake. Whereas those that understad these places, do know that there is not to be wished a more generall liberty in point of judgment or debate, then what is here allowed. So that there is scarce any Hypothesis, which hath been formerly or lately entertained by Judicious men, and seemes to have in it any clearenesse or consistency, but hath here its strenuous Assertours, as the Atomicall and Magneticall in Philosophy, the Copernican in Astronomy &c. And though we do very much honour Aristotle for his profound judgment and universall learning, yet are we so farre from being tyed up to his opinions, that persons of all conditions amongst us take liberty to discent fom him, and to declare against him, according as any contrary evidence doth ingage them, being ready to follow the Banner of truth by whomsoever it shall be lifted up. Witnesse the publick Lectures of our Professors, the Positions or Questions maintained in the publick Exercise of the Vniversitie for Degrees, & in the private Exercises of Colledges, besides the Instructions and readings of many Tutors, wherein the principall things which this Author doth accuse us to be ignorant of, and enemies unto, are taught and owned, and I can assure him they are so well learnt, that for all his contempt of the Universityes, we have here many young boyes (who have not yet attained to that very proud & vainglorious title of Bachelours of Art, (as he is pleased to phrase it) that are able to reforme this Reformer, in those things, wherein he thinks us all so ignorant, and himselfe so great a Master. 2. And for his ignorance in the common grounds of those things which he undertakes to advance and promote, his whole Discourse doth not so clearely prove any thing else, (not that which he intends by it,) as it doth prove this. Let any serious man but consider the two first Chapters of it, wherein he endeavours to prove, Vniversities are not in any kind usefull to fit men for the Ministry, but opposite thereunto, pag. 3. And that those Systems of Theology, which are therein taught are not only uselesse but hurtfull, pag. 10. One might reasonably expect that upon flinging out his Gauntlet for the defence of such positions as these, this Author should muster up his forces, and appeare at least with some seeming strength and reason. And yet he doth nothing lesse.

First occasionally Written, among some other Essays, to a Friend; and now suffer'd to come abroad as THE BEGINNING Of An Experimental History OF COLOURS. By the Honourable ROBERT BOYLE, Fellow of the ROYAL SOCIETY. Non fingendum, aut excogitandum, sed inveniendum, quid Natura faciat, aut ferat. Bacon. LONDON, Printed for Henry Herringman at the Anchor in the Lower walk of the New-Exchange. MDCLXIV.   Image 2 (unnumbered page) Unnumbered page THE PREFACE. HAving in convenient places of the following Treatise, mention'd the Motives, that induc'd me to write it, and the Scope I propos'd to my self in it, I think it superfluous to entertain the Reader now, with what he will meet with hereafter. And I should judge it needless, to trouble others, or my self, with any thing of Preface: were it not that I can scarce doubt, but this Book will fall into the hands of some Readers, who being unacquainted with the difficulty of attempts of this nature, will think it strange that I should publish any thing about Colours, without a particular Theory of them. But I dare expect that Intelligent and Equitable Readers will consider on my behalf: That the professed Design of this Treatise is to deliver things rather Historical than Image 3 (unnumbered page) Dogmatical, and consequently if I have added divers new speculative Considerations and hints, which perhaps may afford no despicable Assistance towards the framing of a solid and comprehensive Hypothesis, I have done at least as much as I promis'd, or as the nature of my Undertaking exacted. But another thing there is, which if it should be objected, I fear I should not be able so easily to answer it, and that is; That in the following Treatise (especially in the Third part of it) the Experiments might have been better Marshall'd, and some of them deliver'd in fewer words. For I must confess that this Essay was written to a private Friend, and that too, by snatches, at several times, and places, and (after my manner) in loose sheets, of which I oftentimes had not all by me that I had already written, when I was writing more, so that it needs be no wonder if all the Experiments be not rang'd to the best Advantage, and if some connections and consecutions of them might easily have been mended. Especially since having carelesly laid by the loose Papers, for several years after they were written, when I came to put them together to dispatch them to the Press, I found some of those I reckon'd upon, to be very unseasonably wanting. And to make any great change in the order of the rest, was more than the Printers importunity, and that, of my own avoavocations Unnumbered page (and perhaps also considerabler sollicitations) would permit. But though some few preambles of the particular Experiments might have (perchance) been spar'd, or shorten'd, if I had had all my Papers under my View at once; Yet in the most of those Introductory passages, the Reader will (I hope) find hints, or Advertisements, as well as Transitions. If I sometimes seem to insist long upon the circumstances of a Tryall, I hope I shall be easily excused by those that both know, how nice divers experiments of Colours are, and consider, that I was not barely to relate them, but so as to teach a young Gentleman to make them. And if I was not sollicitous, to make a nicer division of the whole Treatise, than into three parts, whereof the One contains some Considerations about Colours in general. The Other exhibits a specimen of an Account of particular Colours, Exemplifi'd in whiteness and Blackness. And the Third promiscuous Experiments about the remaining Colours (especially Red) in order to a Theory of them. If, I say, I contented my self with this easie Division of my Discourse, it was perhaps because I did not think it so necessary to be Curious about the Method or Contrivance of a Treatise, wherein I do not pretend to present my Reader with a compleat Fabrick, or so much as Modell; but only to bring in Materials proper for the Building; And if I Image 4 (unnumbered page) did not well know how Ingenious the Curiosity and Civility of Friends makes them, to perswade Men by specious allegations, to gratifie their desires; I should have been made to believe by persons very well qualify'd to judge of matters of this nature, that the following Experiments will not need the addition of accurate Method and speculative Notions to procure Acceptance for the Treatise that contains them: For it hath been represented, That in most of them, as the Novelly will make them surprizing, and the Quickness of performance, keep them from being tedious; so the sensible changes, that are effected by them, are so manifest, so great, and so sudden, that scarce any will be displeased to see them, and those that are any thing Curious will scarce be able to see them, without finding themselves excited, to make Reflexions upon Them. But though with me, who love to measure Phyfical things by their use, not their strangeness, or prettiness, the partiality of others prevails not to make me over value these, or look upon them in themselves as other than Trifles: Yet I confess, that ever since I did divers years ago shew some of them to a Learned Company of Virtuosi: so many persons of differing Conditions, and ev'n Sexes, have been Curious to see them, and pleas'd not to Dislike them, that I cannot Despair, but that by complying with those that urge the Publicaion Unnumbered page of them, I may both gratifie and excite the Curious, and lay perhaps a Foundation whereon either others or my self may in time superstruct a substantial Theory of Colours. And if Aristotle, after his Master Plato, have rightly observ'd Admiration to be the Parent of Philosophy, the wonder, some of these Trifles have been wont to produce in all sorts of Beholders, and the access they have sometimes gain'd ev'n to the Closets of Ladies, seem to promise, that since the subject is so pleasing, that the Speculation appears as Delightfull as Difficult, such easie and recreative Experiments, which require but little time, or charge, or trouble in the making, and when made are sensible and surprizing enough, may contribute more than others, (far more important but as much more difficult) to recommend those parts of Learning (Chymistry and Corpuscular Philosophy) by which they have been produc'd, and to which they give Testimony ev'n to such kind of persons, as value a pretty Trick more than a true Notion, and would scarce admit Philosophy, if it approach'd them in another Dress: without the strangeness or endearments of pleasantness to recommend it. I know that I do but ill consult my own Advantage in the consenting to the Publication of the following Treatise: For those things, which, whilst men knew not how they were perform'd, Image 5 (unnumbered page) appear'd so strange, will, when the way of making them, and the Grounds on which I devis'd them, shall be Publick, quickly lose all that their being Rarityes, and their being thought Mysteries, contributed to recommend them. But 'tis fitter for Mountebancks than Naturalis to desire to have their discoverys rather admir'd than understood, and for my part I had much rather deserve the thanks of the Ingenious, than enjoy the Applause of the Ignorant. And if I can so farr contribute to the discovery of the nature of Colours, as to help the Curious to it, I shall have reach'd my End, and sav'd my self some Labour which else I may chance be tempted to undergo in prosecuting that subject, and adding to this Treatise, which I therefore call a History, because it chiefly contains matters of fact, and which History the Title declares me to look upon but as Begun: Because though that above a hundred, not to say a hundred and fifty Experiments, (some loose, and others interwoven amongst the discourses them selves) may suffice to give a Beginning to a History not hitherto, that I know, begun by any; yet the subject is so fruitfull, and so worthy, that those that are Curious of these Matters will be farr more wanting to themselves than I can suspect, if what I now publish prove any more than a Beginning. For, as I hope my End avours Unnumbered page may afford them some assistance towards this work, so those Endeavours aremuch too Vnfinish'd to give them any discouragement, as if there were little left for others to do towards the History of Colours. For (first) I have been willing to leave unmention'd the most part of those Phaenomena of Colours, that Nature presents us of her own accord, (that is, without being guided or overruld by man) such as the different Colours that several sorts of Fruites pass through before they are perfectly ripe, and those that appear upon the fading of flowers and leaves, and the putrifaction (and its several degrees) of fruits, &c. together with a thousand other obvious Instances of the changes of colours. Nor have I much medled with those familiar Phaenomena wherein man is not an Idle spectator; such as the Greenness produc'd by salt in Beef much powder'd, and the Redness produc'd in the shells of Lobsters upon the boyling of those fisles; For I was willing to leave the gathering of Observations to those that have not the Opportunity to make Expements. And for the same Reasons, among others, I did purposly omit the Lucriferous practise of Trades-men about colours; as the ways of making Pigments, of Bleanching wax, of dying Scarlet, &c. though to divers of them I be not a stranger, and of some I have myself made Tryall. Image 6 (unnumbered page) Next; I did purposely pass by divers Experiments of other Writers that I had made Tryall of (and that not without registring some of their Events) unless I could some way or other improve them, because I wanted leasure to insert them, and had thoughts of prosecuting the work once begun of laying together those I had examin'd by themselves in case of my not being prevented by others diligence. So that there remains not a little, among the things that are already published, to imploy those that have a mind to exercise themselves in repeating and examining them. And I will not undertake, that none of the things deliver'd, ev'n in this Treatise, though never so faithfully set down, may not prove to be thus farr of this Sort, as to afford the Curious somewhat to add about them. For I remember that I have somewhere in the Book itself acknowledged, that having written it by snatches, partly in the Countrey, and partly at unseasonable times of the year, when the want of fit Instruments, and of a competent variety of flowers, salts, Pigments, and other materials made me leave some of the following Experiments, (especialy those about Emphatical Colours) far more unfinishd than they should have been, if it had been as easie for me to supply what was wanting to compleat them, as to discern. Thirdly to avoyd discouraging the young Gentleman I call Pyrophilus, whom Unnumbered page the less Familiar, and more Laborious operations of Chymistry would probably have frighted, I purposely declin'd in what I writ to him, the setting down any Number of such Chymicall Experiments, as, by being very elaborate or tedious, would either require much skill, or exercise his patience. And yet that this sort of Experiments is exceedingly Numerous, and might more than a little inrich the History of Colours, those that are vers'd in Chymical processes, will, I presume, easily allow me. And (Lastly) for as much as I have occasion more than once in my several Writings to treat either porposely or incidentally of matters relating to Colours; I did not, perhaps, conceive my self oblig'd, to deliver in one Treatise all that I would say concerning that subject. But to conclude, by summing up what I would say concerning what I have and what I have not done, in the following Papers; I shall not (on the one side) deny, that considering that I pretended not to write an accurate Treatise of Colours, but an Occasional Essay to acquaint a private firiend with what then occurrd to me of the things I had thought or try'd concerning them; I might presume I did enough for once, if I did clearly and faithfully set down, though not all the Experiments I could, yet at least such a Image 7 (unnumbered page) variety of them, that an attentive Reader that shall consider the Grounds on which they have been made, and the hints that are purposely (though dispersedly) couched in them, may easily compound them, and otherwise vary them, so as very much to increase their Number. And yet (on the other side) I am so sensible both of how much I have, either out of necessity or choice, left undone, and of the fruitfullness of the subject I have begun to handle; that though I had performed far more then 'tis like many Readers will judge I have, I should yet be very free to let them apply to my Attempts that of Seneca, where having spoken of the Study of Natures Mysteries, and Particularly of the Cause of Earth-Quakes, he subjoins.

Friendly Reader, HEre is presented to thy view one of the Abstrusest as well as the Gentilest Subjects of Natural Philosophy, the Experimentall History of Colours; which though the Noble Author be pleased to think but Begun, yet I must take leave to say, that I think it so well begun, that the work is more than half dispatcht. Concerning which I cannot but give this advertisement to the Reader, that I have heard the Author express himself, that it would not surprise him, if it should happen to be objected, that some of these Experiments have been already published, partly by Chymists, and partly by two or three very fresh Writers upon other Subjects. And though the number of these Experiments be but very small, and though they be none of the considerablest, yet it may on this occasion be further represented, that it is easie for our Author to name several men, (of whose number I can truly name my Image 8 (unnumbered page) self) who remember either their having seen him make, or their having read, his Accounts of the Experiments delivered in the following Tract several years since, and long before the publication of the Books, wherein they are mentioned. Nay in divers passages (where he could do it without any great inconvenience) he hath struck out Experiments, which he had tryed many years ago, because he since found them divulged by persons from whom he had not the least hint of them; which yet is not touched, with design to reflect upon any Ingenious Man, as if he were a Plagiary: For, though our Generous Author were not reserved enough in shewing his Experiments to those that expressed a Curiosity to see them (amongst whom a very Learned Man hath been pleased publickly to acknowledge it several years ago He that desires more instances of this kind and matter, that according to this doctrine may much help the Theory of colours, and particularly the force both of Sulphureous and volatile, as likewise of Alcalizate and Acid Salts, and in what particulars, Colours likely depend not in their causation from any Salt at all, may beg his information from M. Boyle, who hath some while since honoured me with the sight of his papers concerning this subject, containing many excellent experiments, made by him for the Elucidation of this doctrine, &c. Dr. R. Sharrock in his ingenious and usefull History of the Propagation and Improvement of Vegetables, published in the yeare 1660.; yet the same thing may be well enough lighted on by persons that know nothing of one Unnumbered page another. And especially Chymical Laboratories may many times afford the same Phaenomenon about Colours to several persons at the same or differing times. And as for the few Phaenomena mentioned in the same Chymical writers, as well as in the following Treatise, our Author hath given an account, why he did not decline rejecting them, in the Anotations upon the 47th Experiment of the third part. Not here to mention, what he elsewhere saith, to shew what use may be Justifiably made of Eperiments not of his own devising by a writer of Natural History, if, what he employes of others mens, be well examined or verified by himself. In the mean time, this Treatise is such, that there needs no other invitation to peruse it, but that tis composed by one of the Deepest & Most indefatigable searchers of Nature, which, I think the World, as far as I know it, affords. For mine own part, I feel a secret Joy within me, to see such beginings upon such Themes, it being demonstratively true, Mota facilius moveri, which causeth me to entertain strong hopes, that this Illustrious Virtuoso and Restless Inquirer into Nature's Secrets will not stop here, but go on and prosper in the Disquisition of the other principal Colours, Green, Red, and Yellow. The Reasoning faculty set Image 9 (unnumbered page) once a sloat, will be carried on, and that with ease, especially, when the productions thereof meet, as they do here, with so greedy an Entertainment at home and a broad. I am confident, that the ROYAL SOCIETY, lately constituted by his MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY for improving Natural knowledge, will Judge it their interest to exhort our Author to the prosecution of this Argument, considering, how much it is their design and business to accumulate a good stock of such accurate Observations and Experiments, as may afford them and their Offpring genuine Matter to raise a Masculine Philosophy upon, whereby the Mind of Man may be enobled with the Knowledge of solid Truths, and the Life of Man benefited with ampler accommodations, than it hath been hitherto. Our Great Author, one of the Pillars of that Illustrious Corporation, is constantly furnishing large Symbola's to this work, and is now falln, as you see, upon so comprehensive and important a theme, as will, if insisted on and compleated, prove one of the considerablest peeces of that structure. To which, if he shall please to add his Treatise of Heat and Flame, as he is ready to publish his Unnumbered page Experimental Accounts of Cold, I esteem, the World will be obliged to Him for having shewed them both the Right and Left Hand of Nature, and the Operations thereof. The considering Reader will by this very Treatise see abundant cause to sollicit the Author for more; sure I am, that of whatever of the Productions of his Ingeny comes into Forein parts (where I am happy in the acquaintance of many intelligent friends) is highly valued; And to my knowledge, there are those among the French, that have lately begun to learn English, on purpose to enable themselves to read his Books, being impatient of their Traduction into Latin. If I durst say all, I know of the Elogies received by me from abroad concerning Him, I should perhaps make this Preamble too prolix, and certainly offend the modesty of our Author. Wherefore I shall leave this, and conclude with desiring the Reader, that if he meet with other faults besides those, that the Errata take notice of (as I believe he may) he will please to consider both the weakness of the Authors eyes, for not reviewing, and the manifold Avocations Image 10 (unnumbered page) of the Publisher for not doing his part; who taketh his leave with inviting those, that have also considered this Nice subject experimentally, to follow the Example of our Noble Author, and impart such and the like performances to the now very inquisitive world. Farewell.   Unnumbered page THE CONTENTS.  CHAP. I. THe Author shews the Reason, first of his Writing on this Subject (1.) Next of his present manner of Handling it, and why he partly declines a Methodical way (2.) and why he has partly made use of it in the History of Whiteness and Blackness. (3.) Chap. 2. Some general Considerations are premis'd, first of the Insignificancy of the Observation of Colours in many Bodies (4, 5.) and the Importance of it in others (5.) as particularly in the Tempering of Steel (6, 7, 8.) The reason why other particular Instances are in that place omitted (9.) A necessary distinction about Colour premis'd (10, 11.) That Colour is not Inherent in the Object (11.) prov'd first by the Phantasms of Colours to Dreaming men, and Lunaticks; Secondly by the sensation or apparition of Light upon a Blow given the Eye or the Distemper Image 11 (unnumbered page) of the Brain from internal Vapours (12.). The Author recites a particular Instance in himself; another that hapn'd to an Excellent Person related to him (13.) and a third told him by an Ingenious Physician (14, 15.) Thirdly, from the change of Colours made by the Sensory Disaffected (15, 16.) Some Instances of this are related by the Author, observ'd in himself (16, 17.) others told him by a Lady of known Veracity (18.) And others told him by a very Eminent Man (19.) But the strange Instances afforded by such as are Bit by the Tarantula are omitted, as more properly deliver'd in another place. (20.) Chap. 3. That the Colour of Bodies depends chiefly on the disposition of the Superficial parts, and partly upon the Variety of the Texture of the Object (21.) The former of these are confirm'd by several Persons (22.) and two Instances, the first of the Steel mention'd before, the second of melted Lead (23, 24.) of which last several Observables are noted (25.) A third Instance is added of the Porousness of the appearing smooth Surface of Cork (26, 27.) And that the same kind of Porousness may be also in the other Colour'd Bodies; And of what kind of Figures, the Superficial reflecting Particles of them may be (28.) and of what Bulks, and closeness of Position (29.) How much these may conduce to the Generation of Colour instanc'd in the Whiteness of Froth, and in the mixtures of Dry colour'd Powders (30.) A further explication of the Variety that may be in the Superficial parts of Colour'd Bodies, that may cause that Effect, by an example drawn from the Surface of the Earth (31.) An Apology for Unnumbered page that gross Comparison (32.) That the appearances of the Superficial asperities may be Varied from the position of the Eye, and several Instances given of such appearances (33, 34, 35.) That the appearance of the Superficial particles may be Varied also by their Motion, confirm'd by an Instance of the smoaking Liquor (35.) especially if the Superficial parts be of such a Nature as to appear divers in several Postures, explain'd by the variety of Colours exhibited by the shaken Leaves of some Plants (36.) and by changeable Taffities (37, 38, 39.) The Authors wish that the Variety of Colours in Mother of Pearl were examin'd with a Microscope (40.) And his Conjectures, that possibly good Microscopes might discover those Superficial inequalities to be Real, which we now only imagine, with his reasons drawn partly from the Discoveries of the Telescope, and Microscope (41.) And partly also from the Prodigiously strange example of a Blind man that could feel Colours (42.) whose History is Related (43, 44, 45.) The Authors conjecture and thoughts of it (46, 47, 48, 49.) and several Conclusions and Corollaries drawn from it about the Nature of Blackness and Black Bodies (50, 51, 52.) and about the Asperities of several other Colour'd Bodies (53.) And from these, and some premis'd Considerations, are propos'd some Conjectures; That the reason of the several Phaenomena of Colours, afterwards to be met with, depends upon the Disposition of the Seen parts of the Object (54.) That Liquors may alter the Colours of each other, and of other Bodies, first by their Insinuating themselves into the Pores, and Image 12 (unnumbered page) filling them, whence the Asperity of the Surface of a Body becomes alter'd, explicated with some Instances (55, 56.) Next by removing those Bodies, which before hindred the appearance of the Genuine Colour, confirm'd by several examples (57) Thirdly, by making a Fissure or Separation either in the Contiguous or Continued Particles of a Body (58.) Fourthly, by a �nion or Conjunction of the formerly separated Particles; Illustrated with divers Instances of precipitated Bodies (59.) Fifthly, by Dislocating the parts, and putting them both into other Orders and Postures, which is Illustrated with Instances (60, 61.) Sixthly, by Motion, which is explain'd (62.) And lastly, and chiefly, by the �nion of the Saline Bodies, with the Superficial parts of another Body, whereby both their Bigness and Shape must necessarily be alter'd (63, 64.) Explain'd by Experiments (65, 66.) That the Colour of Bodies may be Chang'd by the concurrence of two or more of these ways (67.) And besides all these, Eight Reflective causes of Colours, there may be in Transparent Bodies several Refractive (68, 69.) Why the Author thinks the Nature of Colours deserves yet a further Inquiry (69.) First, for that the little Motes of Dust exhibited very lovely Colours in a darkned Room, whilst in a convenient posture to the Eye, which in other Postures and Lights they did not (70.) And that though the smaller Parts of some Colour'd Bodies are Transparent, yet of others they are not, so that the first Doubt's, whether the Superficial parts create those Colours, and the second, whether there be any Refraction at all in the later (71, 72, 73.) A Unnumbered page famous Controversie among Philosophers, about the Nature of Colour decided. (74. 75.) Chap. 4. The controversie stated about Real and Emphatical Colours (75, 76.) That the great Disparity between them seems to be, partly their Duration in the same state, and partly, that Genuine Colours are produc'd in Opacous Bodies by Reflection, and Emphatical in Transparent by Refraction (78.) but that this is not to be taken in too large a Sense, the Cautionary instance of Froth is alleged and insisted on (78, 79.) That the Duration is not a sufficient Characteristick, exemplify'd by the duration of Froth, and other Emphatical Colours, and the suddain fading of Flowers, and other Bodies of Real ones (80.) That the position of the Eye is not necessary to the discerning Emphatical Colours, shew'd by the seeing white Froth, or an Iris cast on the Wall by a Prism, in what place of the Room soever the Eye be (81.) which proceeds from the specular Reflection of the Wall (82.) that Emphatical Colours may be Compounded, and that the present Discourse is not much concern'd, whether there be, or be not made a distinction between Real and Emphatical Colours. (83.) Chap. 5. Six Hypotheses about Colour recited (84, 85) Why the Author cannot more fully Speak of any of these (86.) nor Acquiesce in them (87, 88.) What Pyrophilus is to expect in this Treatise (88, 89.) What Hypothesis of Light and Colour the Author most inclines too (90.) Why he thinks neither that nor any other sufficient; and what his Difficulties are, that Image 13 (unnumbered page) make him decline all Hypotheses, and to think it very difficult to stick to any. (91, 92.)   Part the Second. Of the Nature of Whiteness and Blackness. CHAP. I. THe reason why the Author chose the Explication of Whiteness and Blackness (93.) Wherein Democritus thought amiss of these (94.) Gassendus his Opinion about them (95.) What the Author approves, and a more full Explication of White, making it a Multiplicity of Light or Reflections (96, 97.) Confirm'd first by the Whiteness of the Meridian Sun, observ'd in Water (98.) and of a piece of Iron glowing Hot (99.) Secondly, by the Offensiveness of Snow to the Travellers eyes, confirm'd by an example of a Person that has Travell'd much in Russia (100.) and by an Observation out of Olaus Magnus (100.) and that the Snow does inlighten and clear the Air in the Night, confirm'd by the Mosco Physician, and Captain James (101.) But that Snow has no inherent Light, prov'd by Experience (102.) Thirdly, by the great store of Reflections, from white Bodies observ'd in a darkned Room, and by their unaptness to be Kindled by a Burning-glass (103.) Fourthly, the Specularness of White Bodies is confirm'd by the Reflections in a dark Room from other Bodies (104.) and by the appearance Unnumbered page of a River, which both to the Eye and in a darkned Room appear'd White (105. 106.) Fifthly, by the Whiteness of distill'd Mercury, and that of the Galaxie (107, 108.) and by the Whiteness of Froth, rais'd from whites of Eggs beaten; that this Whiteness comes not from the Air, shew'd by Experiments (109. 110.) where occasionally the Whiteness of Distill'd Oyls, Hot water, &c. are shew'd (111.) That it seems not necessary the Reflecting Surfaces should be Sphaerical, confirm'd by Experiments (112, 113.) Sixthly, by the Whiteness of the Powders of transparent Bodies (114.) Seventhly, by the Experiment of Whitening and Burnishing Silver. (115. 116.) Chap. 2. A Recital of some Opinions about Blackness, and which the Author inclines to (117.) which he further insists on and explicates (118, 119.) and shews for what reasons he imbrac'd that Hypothesis (120.) First, from the contrary Nature of Whiteness and Blackness, White reflecting most Beams outwards, Black should reflect most inward (120.) Next, from the Black appearance of all Bodies, when Shadow'd; And the manner how this paucity of Refection outwards is caus'd, is further explicated, byshewing that the Superficial parts may be Conica and Pyramical (121.) This and other Considrations formerly deliver'd, Illustrated by Experiments with black and white Marble (122, 123.) Thirdly, from the Black appearance of Holes in whit Linnen, and from the appearance of Velvet stroak'd several ways, and from an Observation Image 14 (unnumbered page) of Carrots (124, 125.) Fourthly, from the small Reflection from Black in a darkned Room (125, 126.) Fifthly, from the Experiment of a Checker'd Tile expos'd to the Sun-beams (127.) which is to be preferr'd before a Similar Experiment try'd in Italy, with black and white Marble (128.) Some other congruous Observations (129.) Sixthly, from the Roasting black'd Eggs in the Sun (130.) Seventhly, by the Observation of the Blind man lately mention'd, and of another mention'd by Bartholine (130.) That notwithstanding all these Reasons, the Author is not absolutely Positive, but remains yet a Secker after the true Nature of Whiteness and Blackness. (131, 132.) Experiments in Consort, touching Whiteness and Blackness. The first Experiment, with a Solution of Sublimate, made White with Spirit of Urine, &c. (133, 134.) The second Experiment, with an Infusion of Galls, made Black with Vitriol, &c. (135, 136) further Discours'd of (137.) The third Experiment, of the Blacking of Hrtshorn, and Ivory, and Tartar, and by a father Calcination making them White (138, 139. The fourth Experiment, limiting the Chmist's principle, Adusta nigra sed perusta a""a"

Image 2 (unnumbered page) Unnumbered page THE Publishers Preface TO THE READER. WE do with all Respects and Candidness, present you with the Works of one who was a true and faithful Labourer in his Day; his Pains hath been bestowed, in watering and cultivating, what was sown by another Hand. And having imployed his Time and Talent well, is entered into his Lord's rest; enjoying that Peace which must necessarily result from a faithful Performance of a Trust given by our great Lord. We can give but a very short account of the Author, but hope this Publication may produce a fuller, from some of his Personal Acquaintance. As we are informed, it was one Mr. Edward Taylor an English Gentleman, the latter part of his time he lived at Dublin, in much Privacy and Retirement, where he made this his Work and Business. He died at Dublin about the Year 1684. His Manuscripts were preserved by the Care of a Friend, and brought over hither, where they have lain some time in Private; But considering how much we are beholding to our Predecessors for their great Pains taken to inform us, their Writings Published being a Testimony of their good Will to Posterity: And also considering the Labour taken by this good Man for a Publick Benefit, we could not in Justice to the Author deceased, nor with the respect we owe to all Mankind as our Brethren, suffer so Good and Profitable a Work, to Perish under our Custody; without incurring the guilt of Ingratitude, if not of Inhumanity. We have hereby indeavoured to set this Light in Publick View, and that it may prove of use to direct the Course of any, in this dark and dismal Passage, towards the Haven of Rest, is what we earnestly desire and seek. He was a Devout Christian, a Sincere Protestant, living in the Communion Image 3 (unnumbered page) of the Church of England, and earnest he was in vindicating the Truth, abhorring a bare outside Formality, which only hath the Name and Profession, but wants the Nature, Life and Power of Religion. He was not for making Rents and Divisions amongst Men, by setting up a new Sect, or having a People called after his Name, thereby to gain Applause, or to make himself great. But made it his Business to Learn and Improve, in the Knowledge and Understanding of the Divine and Natural Mysteries. We are very apt to regret the loss of worthy Instruments, such as have been raised up in an Extraordinary Manner, and Eminently Qualified above their Brethren, hoping that if we had enjoyed their good Converse, we might have greatly benefited and improved thereby: without doubt they have a great Happiness that injoy such a Benefit and improve it. But we must consider that they are but Men, and are indeed but Instruments or Vehicles, and it is very rare but that the Purity and Excellency of Truth conveyed by them, receives some Shadow or Soil from the Medium. Their chief work hath been to direct us to the Fountain of Wisdom, which is open at all times to all Persons, ready to inform all that truly seek Wisdom there: And from this Universal Fountain every one receives according to their Capacities. And accordingly it is required, that every one should Communicate or Prophecy according to their proportion of Faith received; now Faith is every particular Man's Evidence, and not anothers: Thus, although one may have a larger Measure, or more Mysterious, yet there is no disharmony, but all tends to the Benefit of the whole. And teaching all Wisdom, that every one may be presented perfect in Christ. Although we cannot Comprehend all Truth, let us remain humble sincere Searchers, and in due time we shall be rewarded with her Treasures; when the Captious, Disdaining, Mocking Spirits, shall reap their Reward, that is to be perfected in that Principle they have given themselves up to as Servants. The Writings of the Divinely inspired Jacob Behmen, called the Teutonick Philosopher, have been by many received with great Satisfaction, and have contributed towards the Extricating their Minds out of those Labyrinths and Difficulties, wherein Evil Practice and Opinions (kept up by Custom) had involved them. The greatest Objection raised against the said Writings have been their Abstruseness, and Uncouth Expressions, making them almost impossible to be understood; which now is answered and removed; Here being a Person raised up to bear Testimony to their Truth, who by delivering his Sense in more usual and familiar words, it is hoped may have render'd them clear. Unnumbered pageIn his Considerations on the Subject, Matter and Scope of the Writings of Jacob Behmen, He doth (from the Types, Figures and Sacrifices under the Law, from things we are most conversant with through the whole Creation, from Heaven and Earth, and from Man himself) Demonstrate the Truth of his Doctrine to be well-grounded, upon the uncontroulable Maxims of Confessed Theology and Philosophy. The 177 Theosophick Questions which were propounded by J. Behmen, of which he lived to Answer but 13, and part of the 15th, the rest of them lying unanswered, till this Good Man being spirited thereto, took up the task, and hath performed it as an able Workman, Answering the Remainder, and hath given us some Meditations on part of the said Questions and Answers: All treating of the highest Mysteries, and yet what we (in Duty) ought to be most conversant about. His Extracts of several of the Works of Jacob Behmen were intended for the use of those that had not, or could not procure the said Writings, and also to give a Summary Account of the whole: which may be as an Introduction, opening the Gates to us, and promote a further Communication of these great and most useful Truths. The Apostle Paul preached to the Athenians the Knowledge of that God whom they ignorantly adored: Even so these Writings serve or tend to teach us by plain Demonstration what we, like the Athenians, are too Ignorant of. It is written God is one, which certainly is as true as where it is said, There are three that bear Record in Heaven. It is written, Our God is a consuming Fire. And yet said to be,Heb. 12. 29. Light, and Love, and in him is no Darkness at all, that he is meek, merciful, of everlasting kindness, and that fury is not in him. It is also written, God sware by two Immutable things, in which itHeb. 6. 18. was impossible for God to lye. And because he could Swear by no greater, he Sware by himself, That Blessing he would Bless Abraham: And Curse him that Cursed Abraham. Here are two Principles clearly express'd, andGen. 12. 3. both called Immutable: The one Wrath and Fury, and a consuming Fire; The other Love, Meekness and Light ineffable. Had Man stood in his Primitive State totally resigned to the Divine Love, he had not known the Principle of Wrath, but it had remained more hidden than the bitterness of the Root is in the most pleasant Fruit. But when Man was fallen into the state of Evil and Good, the Infinite Love of God descends in order to restore him, and then sets before him Blessings on the one hand, and Cursings on the other. These great Truths are at large treated of and explained, and by them we are Taught what Use and Improvement to make thereof. How can we tell what God's Mercy is, till we come to know him that Image 4 (unnumbered page) is Merciful; And what Christ's Merits are, till we know Christ in us and him Crucified? For if we content our selves with an Historical Knowledge, it is to be feared it will be attended with an Hypocritical Obedience. The Law that all true Christians ought to square their Actions by, is the New Commandment; else they are not known to be Christ's Disciples. All those worthy Instruments that have Taught or Writ from the Holy Aointing, directed their Hearers or Readers, to him that is the true Teacher, that they might receive their Knowledge from the same Root with themselves. And then unto such they wanted no Epistle of Recommendation, they being their Epistle written with the Spirit of the Living God, not in Tables of Stone, but in the fleshly Tables of the Heart, known and read of all Men. To such the Language of the Scriptures comes to be more clear, and can discern the Correction, Instruction and Comfort held forth in them, and how they are able to furnish the Man of God to every good Work. Also why there is no Ability in them to furnish any man else, but as they Convert, and become new Men. The great Affair of Man's Happiness depending upon the Conversion of his Will; for as the first Man by turning his Will from God into this World from the Unity and Harmony he at first was placed in (and so was truly Honourable) into Multiplicity, Selfhood, Lust and Enmity: thereby became an abominate to God's Holiness, attracting a Bestial Body, and a Mind darkned, Ignorant and Estranged from God. It is real Resignation that brings a Death upon Self-hood, and that must continually be performed, that the Enmity being mortified, the resigned Will may become an Instrument in God's Hand, to be agitated thereby; for his Servants we are whom we yield Obedience unto. Here ariseth the strife and warfare in Man, The Corrupt Will in Selfhood accounts it folly and madness to submit to Death, when the Pleasures and Voluptuousness of this VVorld might be lived in and injoyed. But the resigned sees, that as at first it precipitated Man from that Happy state in which he was placed; so the tendency and end thereof is to fill us with Eternal sorrow and misery. Thus it is to become Fools that we may be made VVise, and Poor that we may be made Rich; as having Nothing, yet possessing all things,  """"This is the State which Reason's splendid Schools, """"Do nominate the Paradise of Fools.  Whatever specious Pretences to Religion may be made by any, though very fair and beautiful to shew, where this corrupt Will in Self-hood is unmortified; and the Path of Resignation not trod, that Religion is vain, deceitful Unnumbered page and destructive. As the Prophet Isaiah declared in the Name of theIsa. ch. 29. 13, 14. Lord; For as much as this people draw near me with their Mouth, and with their Lips do honour me, but have removed their Heart far from me, and their fear towards me is taught by the Precepts of Men: Therefore the Wisdom of their Wisemen shall perish, and the Understanding of their Prudent Men shall be hid. Our Saviour reciting this place ofMat. ch. 15. v. 29. the Prophet saith, But in vain do they Worship me, teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men. The Wisdom of this World which is1 Cor. ch. 3. v. 9. Foolishness with God, existing in the perverted Will of Man, which hath broken it self off from God, and stands upon its own bottom; by this Wisdom the World neither can know or worship God. The Wisdom of God in his Servants stands in an humble Resignation of themselves to the Divine Love, in order to a Regeneration of their Wills, which is not effected but by slaying this opposite Will in which stands the Enmity in order to know a new Life generated; and as long as Truth and Error, Light and Darkness are in this World, so long must and will this Warfare be continued; happy is he that goes off a Conqueror, for his Garland or Crown is sure to him. And as the World by Wisdom knew not God, so hath it fared likewise in respect to the inquiries made concerning Nature. From hence it is the Apostle Paul gives a caution, To beware lest any Man should spoil them through Philosophy and vain Deceit, after the Tradition of Men, after the Rudiments of this World, and not after Christ. An empty and vain Philosophy hath been introduced and kept up in the World, by Men of corrupt minds estranged from God, and therefore ignorant of Nature: For it is as impossible truely to know Nature, separate and removed from God, as it is to know God in the Wisdom of this World, or truely to worship him, with a Heart removed far from him. What hopes was left after the miserable Fall of Man, when God cursed the Earth for Mans sake, but only the Descent of God, or the Incarnation of Jesus Christ, that inspoken Word of Life, in order to a happy Restoration and Renovation? For as all things were made by this Eternal Word, so all things are upheld by it: This is the Healer of our Wounds, and Repairer of our Breaches. This Word is declared by Moses, and by the Apostle Paul to be near us, even in our Hearts and in our Mouths, that we needDeut. 30. 14. Rom. 10. 8. 1 Cor. 10. 4. not say, Who shall ascend into Heaven, or descend into the Deep to fetch it? This was the Rock in the Wilderness. This is the Stone of Fire in Ezekiel. The Stone with seven Eyes upon it in Zechariah. The White Stone with the New Name, in the Revelation. This is the Salt which we ought to have in our selves. This is the Water and Spirit whereof we must be Born again. King Solomon was indued with great Wisdom, and may properly be said Image 5 (unnumbered page) to have been an Eminent Philosopher; take his Description of Wisdom, and where it is to be found. She is the Breath of the Power of God, and a pure influence flowingWisdom ch. 7. from the Glory of the Almighty: Therefore can no defiled thing fall into her. And being but one she can do all things: And remaining in her self she maketh all things new: And in all Ages entring into holy Souls, she maketh them Friends of God and Prophets. All good things together came to me with her, and innumerable Riches in her hands. And a greater than Solomon saith, Seek ye first the Kingdom of God, and his Righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. This Certainly is not only our Duty, but the great Affair most worthy our Enquiry and Industry. That Work which Man alone is capacitated for, by reason of his noble Extract, and that which is alone a suitable reward to render him truely happy. It is this Work and Wisdom, that the Writings of Jacob Behmen, and these following, are conversant about; laying the Foundation deep, firm and solid; and thereupon raising a regular and noble Building. Here is described at large our Malady and Remedy, both with respect to Time and Eternity; for the Instruction and Teaching of those he calls his School-fellows, and to the perusal of the said Writings, we recommend the Candid Reader. And shall conclude with a Testimony concerning the Writings of Jacob Behmen from an Ingenious and Learned Hand. What soever the thrice great Hermes delivered as Oracles from his Prophetical Tripos; or Pythagoras spake by Authority; or Socrates debated; or Aristotle affirmed; yea whatever Divine Plato Prophesied, or Plotinus proved; this and all this, or a far higher and profounder Philosophy is (I think) contained in the Teutonicks Writings. And if there be any friendly Medium which can possibly reconcile those� Ancient Differences between the Nobler Wisdom, which hath fixt her Palace in Holy Writ, and her stubborn Handmaid, Natural Reason, this happy Marriage of the Spirit and the Soul, this wonderful consent of Discords in one Harmony we owe in great measure to Teutonicus his Skill. Only let not the Non or Misunderstanding of the most rational Reader (if not a little sublimed above the Sphere of common Reason) be imputed as a fault to this Elevated Philosopher, no more than 'twas to the Divine Plotine, whose highest Notions many, even of his own School, after much Study were not able to reach. The way to profit in reading these Writings is to be possest with patience, our Minds standing in singleness and simplicity, and in this frame of Mind, to seek diligently, pray earnestly, and to resign up our Wills intirely to the Unnumbered page Guidance and Conduct of the Divine Love. Importunity and Industry often prevails to the obtaining the desired End, when Sloth and Negligence meets with Disappointments and Shame. Let us humble our selves under the sense of our Misery, and submit to the mortifying our corrupt Wills, and proceed on to Experience a Separation or cleansing from all filthiness of the Flesh, and more secret defilements of the Spirit, through the Power and Energy of the Heavenly Fire, the Divine Life, the Breath or Word of God: That knowing a Death unto Sin, we may also know a Life unto Righteousness, which in the true Heavenly Process being offered up to God as an acceptable Sacrifice, a permanent, fixed and immortal State may be manifest, where there shall be no more going forth for ever. If these followingRev. 3. 12. Sheets contribute in some measure towards the directing and assisting of any, especially the honest Industrious Searcher, it will greatly rejoice the Persons concerned; it being their end and design in the present Publication. Farewel.   Image 6 (unnumbered page) Some Words used by Jacob Behmen explained near to his deep Sense.  AByss, is an Infinity peculiar only to each of the Three Principles. Amass, is a Spirit or Will bringing it self into substance, compaction or manifestation. Anguish, is the third Form of the seven Properties of the Eternal Nature, made of the two first Forms, and making the Sulphurous Spirit.

Element, call'd the one or holy Element, is of or according to the second Principle generated Eternally out of the Eternal Nature or great Mystery, which are according to the first, but where-ever they generate the holy Element there is Paradise. Ens, the proper or peculiar Being or Essence, (Good, or be it Evil) of a thing. Eternal Nature, is of the first Principle, and is that in which standeth two Kingdoms; one, the pure Virgin Wisdom of God, the one holy Element, the cause of the four Elements and Stars: The other, the severe fierce wrath: According to which God calleth himself a consuming Fire. It is therefore the great Mystery. Expressed word comprizeth all Creatures Visible and Invisible. Fiat, the Eternal speaking Word or Creating Power proceeding from the Freewill of the Abyss. Also the desire of the Soul taking the power of the holy Love Tincture, and makes it Essential. Flagrat, or sudden fright, terror� shriek, flash, the severing the two Principles of Light and Darkness; resembling that in Thunder and Lightning, Gunpowder, &c. The pregnant Eccho of the sound of Eternity, speaking (by Magical Firebreath) Love or Anger; Life, in the Light; Death, in the Darkness. Which is called the Salnitral Flagrat. Idea, is the Ens, which with Man first is, and then known: But we wrong God unless we say, it is, because God seeth it. &	, a Divine Sparkle, captiv'd so as can only glimmer, not shine forth. Magia, there are two Magia's, one of the Unity, the other of the Multiplicity, or Astral Powers. And two Magi in Man, the Spirit of God, and Reason, into the latter the Devil easily insinuates. Majesty, the Light of the Glorious Son of God, the second Principle, according to which only God is called God, for according to the first, viz. the Fathers Property, he is not called God, but a consuming Fire. Lubet, a Longing Delight or Beneplacitum. In God, it is the free pregnant will to Manifestation in Nature and Creature; without which all had been an Eternal stilness. The Lubet in Man, is the moving will to Good or Evil. Mysterium Magnum, that out of which all Visible and Invisible Concreates proceeded; it is of the first Principle. Vide Eternal Nature. Out-birth, the visible, palpable, mortal part of this World call'd the Anger-fire. Unnumbered pageSalniter, is that which in the Sulphur is awakened by the heat arising into a Flagrat out of the Brimstony, Watry and Earthy Properties, whereby the Properties are Explicated. Sathan, is meant the Spirit of Error, and not always a Creaturely Devil, but the Property of such an Erroneous Spirit. Salitter, (call'd) Divine Salitter; represented by the Earth, but like the pure Heaven; in it are moving, springing Powers, producing all manner of Divine Trees, Plants, &c. with Heavenly Colours, Smells, Tasts, whereof this Worlds Trees, Gold, Silver, precious Stones, &c. are hard, dead, dark shadows. But this Salitter and Mercurius, (i. e.) Divine Mercurius, is the Food of Angels and Holy Souls. Sophia, the true noble precious Image of Christ, viz. the Wisdom of God, the Tincture of the Light. Source, the original quality or essential property to Love and Anger, Light and Darkness, both according to time and Eternity. Ternarius, or number three in the Language of Nature the Divine Birth in the six Forms of Nature, which are the six Seals of God.

In Man that which Adam's Fall caused almost wholly to disappear. In Vegetables, Animals and Minerals their Vertue� Vitality, or Life, Spirit and Power. Turba, is taken for a fierce Wrath-fire, which destroyeth a corruptible Body: Sometimes for horrid Tempests or� Hellish Blasts, general Contagions, awakened by common Sins, call'd Turba Magna. Sometimes for the Eternal Wrathfire, which swalloweth up an Evil Spirit without a Body; and may be called Turba Maxima.     I.

Unnumbered page A Preface to the Book of Extracts, AND The following Considerations by way of Enquiry into part of the Scope of the Writings of Jacob Behmen. THE Extracts of the Aurora was intended for the particular use of one only, without his purpose of proceeding farther in the other Books, or imparting that, as can hardly escape any ones observation. And tho' more be done than was at first designed, yet oo little is done, and with too many defects. The proceedings in it, like as of a Traveller through a spacious Territory, hath been to comprehend and report the varieties there, according to the degree of ability, intentness and capacity of the passenger. Or as one admitted into exquisite Gardens, deckt with plenty of all curious flowers, &c. fills his hand with a few of those he best knows, or most admires, according to what skill he hath. Or as one at a Royal Feast, feeds only on what his appetite most relisheth. Where the Writer hath contracted below the sublimity of the subject, the Reader may with some ease supply that defect by recourse to, and consulting the blessed Authors Books themselves. Image 8 (unnumbered page)To make them truly conspicuous were the work of a divinely irradiated Expositor, not of an abridgement: And thereto to adapt the minds of (but) the Sons of Wisdom is the Prerogative of the God of Wisdom; for it would bring down Paradise as near us, as mortals could bear so sweet a neighbourhood. Prayer might help us to power, to see (as it were) the voice of the Author J. B. or rather of God in him; for that voice leads us thro' the creatures to the creating Word, convincingly demonstrating not only that God is, but what he is, what he is not, and what of him may be seen in every creature good, bad and mixt, angelical, rational, animal, vegetative, mineral, and the dark earth. Also in all Kingdoms paradisical, astral, elementary, and the dark abyss. And how he may be found in all things good, bad and mixt, in love and wrath. Also whence man fell, what and how low his fall, and how to be restored by Jesus Christ. And all this not a new Doctrine, but that which is substantial, orderly, firmly and naturally founded on the immovable principles, and uncontroulable maxims of confessed Theology and Philosophy, both sacred and natural.

A Comedy, As it is Acted at his Royal Highness the Duke of York's THEATRE. LONDON, Printed for Tho. Dring at the White Lyon in Fleetstreet, over against the Inner-Temple-Gate, 1671.   Image 2 (unnumbered page) Unnumbered page The Preface of the Author. IF wit of this kind did always depend on success, there were little to be said (especially in this age) to justifie the best of the antient, or modern Poesy, the latter of which though short of competition with our former Dramatique Poets, who brought the stage to such a non ultra of designe and wit, that it might have been in some sort their several Glories to have said according to that Poetical boast of OvidJamque opus exegi. And from whom the English Stage alone has given the world, (whatsoever can be objected to the contrary) the best Dramatique Rules, and Plays together. Notwithstanding which, such is the disingenious Humour, or ignorance of the Age we live in, that not only the most deserving of these come to be unfrequented, and slighted by their Auditors, but likewise some few of our modern, that can so far Justifie themselves as to be Imitators of their vertues; and in stead of them obscene, ridiculous and indigested Plays, have their numerous Audiences; as if it were their due to receive a superior allowance, though they deserve not the name of good foils, to set off the beauties of the other; nor can it be denied, that wit (like other most remarkable things) has not generally past its Epochoreca, so that we may compute its renown rather backward than forward, a treasure that cannot be intail'd on posterity, who are observable enough, (especially now a days) to be rather beholding to the abilities of former writers, than able to oblige the world out of their store again. And it is some wonder that such who can pretend to so little of invention and wit, are favourably allow'd to be Authors; and like Bankrupts (though breaking their credit with the world) are permitted to set up still; but if this be the good fortune of any, such as conceive themselves to have any title to desert, have the least cause to Repine, no more than to observe the common ingratitudes of fortune, which does seldome place merit on her right hand; nor is it otherwise to be expected, whilst her greatest Patrons are the most deprav'd, and ignorant of men: and I will presume to say that there was so much good fortune in the fate of this Play, to receive its condemnation from such, who wanted either capacity to receive it, or at least were resolv'd to joyn in a confederacy to oppose that esteem, which the more just and knowing might have probably allow'd Image 3 (unnumbered page) it, either being conscious, that it was better than they were willing it should be thought, or at least not inferiour to what the most celebrated amongst them could produce on the Stage; which consideration did perhaps industriously occasion the disturbance of the Actors in the Representation of this Play, as also the audience in the hearing of it, who could not with any quiet give their attention to the Action, and they had their end; for after this was done, the 2d day, there were few of the sober spectators who would venture that disrespect to themselves to see it often. If there were any persons of quality who did submit to so mean a compliance, as to abet or partake with so ungenerous a carriage, we will spare them the concern of reading themselves here, of whom it may be said as Juvenal, did of some degenerate in his time, Qui Curios simulant, & Bacchanalia vivunt. But that which was said to sharpen the sting of this malice, was the undertaking concerning this Play, because in that there might be some pecuniary loss to add to this triumph. To which it may be answered, that if the adventure were imprudent (and possibly there may be as little reason to hazard mony on the success of wit as on any thing whatsoever) the carriage of such as oppos'd its reception was a far greater extravagancy and folly. And he must distrust his abilities very much (considering some Plays which have had success) if he thinks his own not worth hazarding his mony as well as credit; as on the other side, there are some who would make such a monopoly of their wit, that it is their endeavour none may sell but theirs: though he may be a greater fool that writes ill and loses nothing by it, than he that values himself so far as to adventure on what he conceives merits an esteem. The truth is, not a few of our new Writers have scap'd much better, because their works have not been thought worthy of emulation, though in the apprehension of the Judicious, they have suffer'd enough without other loss than the forfeit of their understandings: and I doubt not (in this extravagant, if not ridiculous Age of censure) a Poet may be condemn'd and yet no delinquent to Parnassus. 'Tis true it lies much within the power of such men, who have any reasonable allowance of judgment to condemn the works of others, but on the other side it deserves some admiration, that those who are but pretenders to it, and who rather keep up a Cabal, or faction of judging, than of abilities fit to sway Unnumbered page others, yet notwithstanding it should lie in their power to suppress the esteem of any; insomuch that an ingenious man might scorn, or at least blush, in behalf of that brow, that should wear a leaf of Lawrel from the favour of these, who like under-graduates in the Schools of the Muses, are too inconsiderable to give Authority to Poesy; wherefore the Author of this play may with modesty enough slight the malevolent carriage, as well as impotent censure of those, who byass'd by prejudice, effected that injury which was given it in the Representation, and he doubts not it will be his sufficient vindication to all impartial, that he now commits it to their perusing in print, who could not receive that satisfaction in seeing it, (by reason of the interruption already mention'd) as he hopes they may by a judicious reading; which had he not cause to believe, he should have been far from presenting that publickly, which could with justice have been nauseated before; it being no less than a double folly, as well as offence, to occasion a second condemnation. Besides, it could not be other than imperfectly perform'd by the Actors, who finding the Play abusively treated, were apt enough to neglect that diligence required to their parts, (as I doubt not it was observ'd by many) there being little respect given by them to wit, (let it be never so deserving) if they find it be not so far succesful, as to be beneficial to themselves. In this somewhat resembling the Judgment of the Turks, who hold nothing good but what is fortunate; but as this providence is not always likely to accompany wit, so the Actors may be allow'd to esteem such Plays that get them most, though it be little credit to their judgments or their Playing, if the latter were not in some kind suitable to that wit, which has rather the good fortune to be receiv'd than good in it self. The humour of the age is so much inclin'd to favour low, and farcelike Mimikry, together with common place wit, (not less undervaluing the Stage than the other) frequently observ'd from discourse in Taverns, French-houses, Coffee-houses, together with the loose and debauch'd carriages of men and women put together, not considering that the wit and beauty of Poesy consist rather in manners feign'd than in such of vulgar observation amongst men, that this Comedy, the humours of which are more remote and Satyrical, could not in reason meet with an applause equal to the former; which though I take to be in some part its commendation, I shall not so far justifie it, as not to give the Reader necessary satisfaction in what he may misconceive from the report or misapprehension of others. Image 4 (unnumbered page) In order to which before I speak of the parts against which I can gather any objection lyes, I will say something of the design, (which is the foundation of a Play) the deficiency whereof doth render all Dramatique compositions neither profitable, nor pleasant, like a structure that is rais'd upon an unsound foundation, & though there be never so many supporters applied of wit to keep it from falling, it will be observ'd so leaning, and tottering, that it cannot be worthy of the Architecture of the Muses, who are too much the Daughters of Science to admit incongruity and error in their works. And as to the contrivance of this Play, that it was new, its greatest adversaries will not, I suppose, deny, (I wish they could say as much in behalf of Plays they most esteem;) that it was not improper, I shall as easily manifest: For what can be objected against my introducing the several common-wealths of men, and women, grounded on suppos'd custome, by affirming it to be novel, and consequently unalowable, the objection is not at all solid, because it is not more impossible that such a manner of rule might be practis'd, than that there were Amazons in one or more parts of the world, (if we will believe Authors) who had a supremacy over men, obtain'd by force of law or power, or at some time or other conferr'd on their ambition by a prevalent indulgence to that sex; or that some Countreys at this day admit of Queens as well as Kings, and perhaps it is more the authority of usage and manners, than the law of nature, which does generally incapacitate the Rule of women, there being not seldome to be found as great abilities in them (allowing for the disadvantage they have in not being suitably educated to letters,) as are to be observ'd in men of greatest comprehensions. But this is suggested not disputed here: their characters in this Play being rather made use of to confirm the judgement and practice of the world in rendring them more properly the weaker Sex, than to authorize their government; though the ambition of that Sex, as likewise the value they are apt enough to allow themselves, may call it a severe policy; but women have small reason to complain, if for their greater honour their beauty, and other attractions give them not seldom such a superintendent esteem that they command in many respects without being oblig'd to power and law, no less absolutely than men. But enough of this particular. For the Characters of this Play, I find those of Foppering and Peacock occasion'd some scrupulous, or inconsiderate spectators to make more than needful objections against them; not but I conceive that Unnumbered page there are few characters in the most approved Plays, which keep so strict a decorum with nature and reason, as that there cannot be observ'd any incongruities in them. Wherefore I shall not so far undertake their vindication, but rather shew how they were usefully to have been receiv'd in order to what was to be expressed by them. And first for Foppering; in whose Character the reader will observe a Satyre against lyars heightn'd by several degrees of traducing of truth; not that every common Lyar keeps that road, or goes so high as the Moon for Fables, which had not been necessary in his case strictly to resemble, because it being satyrically intended against this exorbitancy in men, it might be allow'd to be more bold with truth than they usually are, by reason the higher in that case a Character is rais'd, it is more comprehensive of whatsoever can fall under that notion; as we see in his, which doth not only correct vulgar lying, but by an extravagancy of humour ascends to Astronomers, whose faults could not have otherwise been touch'd; as is instanc'd in their erroneous computations of the motions of the Moon well known to the learned. The like may be said of the part of Peacock, whose vanity of selflove is heightned to introduce that Satyr which is usefully designed against the impossibilities pretended by Chymists, and he could be no otherwise than of an extraordinary humour to represent it, for what had been common could not have done it. And I differ from their judgments who think, that whatsoever is not vulgarly observ'd amongst men, to be therefore not Poetically allowable, which if true, the wit of Poetry were rather commonplace and observation, than invention, in no case to be allow'd. Wherefore there needs no practicable authority for every Character that is produced, if what has been never before observ'd, answer the design of the Author in being useful and corrective to manners, the essential dignity of Comedy, and without which it has small title to that name or desert; besides a Satyr cannot be poetically expressed but it must be highly Hyperbolical, as may be seen in those of Juvenal's, as also in most of the comedies of Ben Jhonson in which are very many characters of no being amongst men, as in his Devil's an Ass, Cinthio's Revels, and others; nay in his more exact one of the silent Woman, I doubt not to affirm that there was never such a man as Morose who convers'd by a whisper through a Trunk, but the Poets authority in that case is sufficient for what is not probable, because it was an extravagancy well applyed to the humour of such a Image 5 (unnumbered page) person, which is sufficient to direct us that things may be allow'd in a Poetical sence which are not naturally so. Who ever disputed against the wonders mention'd by the Poets, the Metamorphosis of Ovid, AEsop's Fables and the like, by reason that the moral of them is more to be regarded than the truth; which consideration has been the best and general authority of introducing of Fables: wherefore to such as are different in opinion, there needs no other reply, but that they are little skill'd in the Muses, and must be beholding to their ignorance for their excuse. As there are few rules for the decision of wit, so it has not always a dignity suitable to its desert, nay very often so far from receiving Justice in that kind, that a judicious person would sooner esteem what generally has been disapproved or condemn'd, than submit his censure to the giddiness of vulgar applause, there being nothing more unstable or erroneous than vox populi in point of plays, as the observation of not a few now extant doth manifest; besides that the Major part of Audiences are neither all Poets nor critical enough to determine of approbation or censure, but rather a commixture of men of several capacities, no more fit to conceive judiciously of what they observe, than if a multitude were consulted about a peice of painting, the generality whereof can hardly distinguish betwixt the Trowel and Pencil: so that it is no wonder, if from the confus'd result of their Judgment, or as they are decoyed by parties and factions, (which some to support their wit implore with more devotion than they pay their Muses, to which purpose they are industrious Orators to the Court and Town) we find the most irregular, and illiterate, obscene and insipid Plays crowded with audiences, where they with better exercise to their bodies sweat for company, than improve their wit, learning, or manners, to do all which should be the use of Plays; whilest the most fortunate of our present Poets may perhaps conceive themselves little less than sacred, in having this vogue, or stream of applause bestowed on their Plays, as if it were the only proper incense to be offer'd to Parnassus in their behalfs: but we may remember that the Red Bull writers, with their Drums, Trumpets, Battels, and Hero's, have had this success formerly, and perhaps have been able to number as many Audiences as our Theatres, (I will not presume to make the comparison otherwise) so likewise the Sock of that stage as well as the Buskin is not so Rank but that it may in some degree tread with our present writers, witness the Farce, alias the comedy of Tu quoque, no less than a Unnumbered page mote for most of the modern of either denomination, and yet of happy memory, in point of audiences, as I doubt not many of ours of the like Genius will be, when they have liv'd as long. And though the ear be the principal sense to receive satisfaction from the Stage, yet we find, that of seeing has not seldome a greater predominancy, whilst Scenes, habits, dances, or perhaps an Actress take more with Spectators, than the best Dramatick wit, or contrivance of the Age, from whence we may prognosticate, that the enterlude of Punchinello, (having some resemblance of the same entertainment) may be as long frequented as either Theatre. Not that I instance this, as a froward reflection on the mean reception of this Play, or any concern depending on it, or that I would have any oblig'd to like what in their aprehensions they judge fit to condemn; which whether in this case, it has proceeded from mistake or prejudice, I doubt not the Reader will candidly consider. For what value can there be given to wit, that it should be esteemed worth contending for, or for which a man would so much as seem to take it ill of the world if he be not thought to write or speak so well as he does, or that one more inconsiderable in either should be allow'd to perform both better? wit being so far from being the inseparable Talent of the wise, that it is observable in some degree, not only in men of mean converse, but in the extravagancies of Fools, and madmen, and what does little redound to the credit of any that has been most successful (I mean on the Stage,) it has seldome been thought weighty enough for applause by such as have been able to put it to the test of sober judgment, who being few in respect of the gaudy and illiterate numbers that resort to Plays, & will take upon them to be at least so far acquainted with Poetry as to call themselves wits, (though they have little more Title to it than pretence, or as far perhaps as a Baudy, or Tavern Jest can give the denomination) the discerning sort of men are as much disabled from over-ruling their Censures, as the Principles of Sobriety, Prudence, and Vertue, are rendred too weak to resist the more prevailing practice of disorder and vice. Wherefore if such who are properly Judges have thought fit to give this Comedy any Credit with the world, the Author will not have cause to conceive its value impair'd by the condemnation of those (though the major part) who wanted either wit, or candor, to allow its repute. As on the other side, the respect of these several persons of ingenuity, and worth, who have thought it deserving Image 6 (unnumbered page) of the Ornaments of their Pens, I doubt not is enough to confirm the Reader that if it be not so good as the Author could wish, it wants not the vindication as well as attest of impartial and knowing apprehensions.

Thy Solymour does his Morose destroy, And thy Black Page undoes his Barbers Boy: His whole College of Ladies must retire Whilst we thy braver Heroins do admire. Tbis New Vtopia rais'd by thee Shall stand a Structure to be wonder'd at, And men shall say this! this is he Who that Poetick City did create, Of which Moor only did the Model draw You did compleat that little world, and gave it Law:   2 If you too great a Prospect do allow To those whom ignorance do at distance seat 'Tis not to say the object is less great, But they want sight to apprehend it so; The Antient Poets in their times When through the Peopled Streets they sung their Rhimes, Found small applause, they sang, but still were poor, Repeated wit enough at every door To've made them Demy Gods, but 'twould not do Till Ages more refin'd esteem'd them so: The Modern Poets have with like success Quitted the Stage, and salli'd from the Press. Great Johnson scarce a Play brought forth But Monster-like it frightect at its birth; Image 7 (unnumbered page) Yet he continu'd still to write And still his Satyre did more sharply bite He writ though certain of his doom (Knowing his Power in Comedy) To please a wiser Age to come; And though he weapons wore to justifie The reason of his Pen; he could not bring Dull souls to sence by Satyre nor by Cudgelling.   3. In vain the errors of the times You strive by wholsome precepts to confute, Not all your power in Prose nor Rhimes Can finish the dispute, 'Twixt those that damn, and those that do admire The heat of your Poetick fire: Your soul of thought you may imploy A nobler way Than in revenge upon a multitude, Whose ignorance only make them rude: Should you that justice do You must for ever bid adieu, To Poetry Divine, And every Muse o'th' nine; For malice then with ignorance would joyn And so undo the world and you And Ravish from them that delight Of seeing the wonders which you write; And all your glories, unadmir'd must lye, As Vestal beauties are intomb'd before they dye.   4 Consider, and consult your wit Despise those Ills you must endure; And raise your scorn as great as it, Be confident, and then secure: And let your rich fraught Pen Adventure out again, Maugre the storms which do oppose its course (Storms which destroy without remorse:) It may new worlds descry, Which peopl'd from thy brain may know Unnumbered page More than the Universe besides can show; More Arts of Love, and more of Gallantry: Write on, and let not after Ages say The Whistle, and rude Hiss could lay, Thy mighty Sprite of Poetry, Which but the Fools and guilty fly; Who dare not in thy Mirror see, Their own deformitie. Where thou in two, the world dost Character, Since most of men Sir Graves, or Peacocks are.   5. And shall that Muse which did ere while Chant forth the glories of the Brittish Isle, Shall she who louder was than fame Now useless lye, and tame? She who late made the Amazons so great And she who conquer'd Scythia too Which Alexander ne'er could do; Will you permit her to retreat? Silence will like submission show And give advantage to the foe. Undaunted let her once again appear And let her lowdly sing in every eare; Then like thy Mistress eyes who have the skill Both to preserve and kill; So thou at once must be reveng'd on those That are thy foes; And on thy Friends such obligations lay As nothing but the deed, the doer can repay.  A. Behn.   Image 8 (unnumbered page) To the Author of the New Vtopia.  On the miscarriage of his Play in Acting. IN vain he seeks to get the worlds applause, Who only pleads the merit of his cause; For now, alas, by faction, or by chance, All happy Candidates their names advance. Faction! the weight that renders good too light; First mov'd by envy, malice, and despight; And ever since indifferently try'd To turn the Scale upon the weaker side. Of old, as now, it did rewards bestow: Witness the noblest Romans overthrow; When standing for the Consulship in choice, Their vertues yielded to the peoples voice. Nor is repulse the worst; but many times, Supreme deserts were punisht as great crimes: So was this Play, by a consorted cry Of wits and wittals, baffled and laid by. They, to preserve themselves in force, condemn; And these, like Pensioners, to follow them: While both presume of nonsence to impeach, Because some fancies went above their reach: Conceit and language only proving good, Where by the hearers they are understood. But trust the Press to vindicate the Stage, And show their judgment was th'effect of rage, Each Scene will there such pointed reasons urge, As may the Blades at once convince and scourge. Thus triumpht Horace o'er his sinking Fate, Making th'united Brothers separate: Who in a Body durst pronounce your Doom, Doubt not but singly you shall overcome.  J. T.   Unnumbered page To the Author of the New Vtopia.  1. HOw happy, Sir, was the last age When learned Johnson rul'd the Stage That Strict observer of mankind. Men were the Books he read, and he Made the whole town his Librarie; Theatres were then the Schools Of good morality, where Knaves and Fools Their follies saw, and vices acted so, Shame, those made honester, these, wiser grow. In every Scene he writ we find With Pleasure Profit joyn'd, And every Comedie He did intend An Errata Page should be, To show men faults and teach 'em how to mend.   2. But this age disesteems true Comedy 'Cause 'tis the mirrour of the times That doth reflect mens follies and their Crimes: So some affected Lady 'cause her glass Shows her how ill she manages her face, Is out of humour with't and throws it by. Now Comedy to Farce gives place, Which but its Zany is, and pleases more With its Grimace, Than all the Arts of Comedy before: Yet is but Comedy turn'd Ridicule, Or humours shown in Masquerade An antick playing of the fool, Which does so fast advance Comedy is laugh'd out of Countenance.   3. But you adventure to retrive The fading glories of the Stage, Whilst this Play you more than give Image 9 (unnumbered page) To the unthankful age. Great Ben thought it enough to swear That his were good Believe me so they are, Could we but find a man had as much wit To read and judg of them as he that writ. The same fate now Do's your Play disallow, 'Tis lik'd by as few as understood. Our age before Ne'er had a Play like this, nor e'er again Will such another see, less you once more Imploy your Pen, Which you must do in scorn of them That for your virtue do your wit condemn. Their spight Brings you more praise than all your friends can write, And does assert Your Fame: For where there's envy, there's desert, That still at excellence doth aim. So mungrel Curs are known To bark against the brightness of the Moon, But let such Criticks still pursue Their malice, and do you Write on, 'tis not allow'd By fate, their breath Should raise a lasting Cloud. For after death Like other Poets you shall have The Bays you merit Planted on your grave. No Poet ere a greater fame acquir'd, Than living, to be envy'd, dead, admir'd.  Edward Ravenscroft.   Unnumbered page To the Author of the New Utopia.  1. I have oft in silence griev'd to see Poor and afflicted Poetry, (Of late so much ador'd) Rudely by ignorance dethron'd, Till you, brave Sir, did timely succour bring, And by your Art restor'd That poor distressed and deposed Queen.   2. You've built her Throne much brighter than before Adding vast treasures to her wasted store; You have enlarg'd her power, and demain By the sole vertue of your Pen; And have remov'd all that usurp'd the sway, That she might rule Without Controul Not Fetter'd by penurious and rebellious law.   3. You've added New Utopia to her Crown Richly Adorn'd with trophies of your own, Surpassing Antient Babylon or Rome; This shall the Eternal seat of Empire be To love and Poesie: In whose soft reign their subjects shall not know The noise of wars Or Civil jars, Whose mighty empire most in peace does grow.   4. In the next age, of this it will be said, They practise by the pattern you have laid. Your prudent Morals that world will reform Which now are lost and smother'd in the Storm. Proceed, great soul, and fear not a worse Doom; But like a Ship bear through your Course Against the wind and waters force; Scattering the angry Billows and their foam,   5. You first controuled the ill-manner'd Stage, Obliging, by correcting vice, the Age; You've sing'd the tattering Pinnions of that Rhime In which our flock of wits seem so sublime: Their maim'd and helpless Muse now groveling lyes; Fluskers and beats the earth but cannot rise. Image 10 (unnumbered page) You've banish'd from the Stage their Jill and Ruffian too, (Enough a thousand Poets to undo) For this they hate and snarle at you. You like the wiser Ages these detest, And all your modest Scenes Seem fil'd with Queens, Only more fair they are and humbly drest.   6. When you have travers'd all the Sciences, Your patient soul in these sweet Arts you ease: You Court your Muse neither for gain nor Dower But all your flame and passion's pure: Your thoughts you show in such a comely dress, As never fullied Theater nor Press; Yet so severely prick That the most sluggish Asse does kick, And scourge no less the fool and lunatick.   7. You have disturb'd our Poets Hive, And what will spoil their game, The stolen sweets you do proclaim, By which the lazy Wasps do live. You must expect they'l buzza while about But yet one breath Like sudden storm or death, Will quickly scatter all that peevish rout.   8. Unwearied Ben in the ungrateful Age Propt up the stooping ruins of the Stage; He bravely finish'd what he knew was good Scorning the envy of the multitude; Rebuk'd, and then sustain'd with patience The poor and rude Revilings of the Croud, And whipt the foolish world at last to sence.   9. Cease not to do undauntedly the same And you'l succeed that great man in his fame. Beamont and witty Fletcher then as due Will yield their Antient glories up to you. Go on, your help you may too long defer And then this Age must give to you What that to Ben did owe: And call you the supporter of the sinking Theater.  S""m"

TO give the Reader an account, Why the following Treatise is suffer'd to pass abroad so maim'd, and imperfect, I must inform him that 'tis now long since, that to gratify an ingenious Gentleman, I set down some of the Reasons that kept me from fully acquiescing either in the Peripatetical, or in the Chymical Doctrine, of the Material Principles of mixt Bodies. This Discourse some years after falling into the hands of some Learned men, had the good luck to be so favourably receiv'd, and advantageously spoken of by them, that having had more then ordinary Invitations given me to make it publick, I thought fit to review it, that I might retrench some things that seem'd not so fit to be shewn to every Reader, And substitute some of those other things that occurr'd to me of Image 3 (unnumbered page)the tryals and observations I had since made. What became of my papers, I elsewhere mention in a Preface where I complain of it: But since I writ That, I found many sheets that belong'd to the subjects I am now about to discourse of. Wherefore seeing that I had then in my hands as much of the first Dialogue as was requisite to state the Case, and serve for an Introduction as well to the conference betwixt Carneades and Eleutherius, as to some other Dialogues, which for certain reasons are not now herewith publish'd, I resolv'd to supply, as well as I could, the Contents of a Paper belonging to the second of the following Discourses, which I could not possibly retrive, though it were the chief of them all. And having once more try'd the Opinion of Friends, but not of the same, about this imperfect work, I found it such, that I was content in complyance with their Desires, that not only it should be publish'd, but that it should be publish'd as soon as conveniently might be. I had indeed all along the Dialogues spoken of my self, as of a third Person; For, they containing Discourses which were among the first Treatises that I ventur'd long ago to write of matters Philosophical, I had reason to desire, with the Painter, to latere pone tabulam, and hear what men would say of them, before I own'd my self to be their Author. But besides that now I find, 'tis not unknown to many who it is Unnumbered pagethat writ them, I am made to believe that 'tis not inexpedient, they should be known to come from a Person not altogether a stranger to Chymical Affairs. And I made the lesse scruple to let them come abroad uncompleated, partly, because my affairs and Prae-ingagements to publish divers other Treatises allow'd me small hopes of being able in a great while to compleat these Dialogues. And partly, because I am not unapt to think, that they may come abroad seasonably enough, though not for the Authors reputation, yet for other purposes. For I observe, that of late Chymistry begins, as indeed it deserves, to be cultivated by Learned Men who before despis'd it; and to be pretended to by many who never cultivated it, that they may be thought not to ignore it: Whence it is come to passe, that divers Chymical Notions about Matters Philosophical are taken for granted and employ'd, and so adopted by very eminent Writers both Naturalists and Physitians. Now this I fear may prove somewhat prejudicial to the Advancement of solid Philosophy: For though I am a great Lover of Chymical Experiments, and though I have no mean esteem of divers Chymical Remedies, yet I distinguish these from their Notions about the causes of things, and their manner of Generation. And for ought I can hitherto discern, there are a thousand Phaenomena in Nature, besides a Image 4 (unnumbered page)Multitude of Accidents relating to the humane Body, which will scarcely be clearly & satisfactorily made out by them that confine themselves to deduce things from Salt, Sulphur and Mercury, and the other Notions peculiar to the Chymists, without taking much more Notice than they are wont to do, of the Motions and Figures, of the small Parts of Matter, and the other more Catholick and Fruitful affections of Bodies. Wherefore it will not perhaps be now unseasonable to let our Carneades warne Men, not to subscribe to the grand Doctrine of the Chymists touching their three Hypostatical Principles, till they have a little examin'd it, and consider'd, how they can clear it from his Objections, divers of which 'tis like they may never have thought on; since a Chymist scarce would, and none but a Chymist could propose them. I hope also it will not be unacceptable to several Ingenious Persons, who are unwilling to determine of any important Controversie, without a previous consideration of what may be said on both sides, and yet have greater desires to understand Chymical Matters, than Opportunities of learning them, to find here together, besides several Experiments of my own purposely made to Illustrate the Doctrine of the Elements, divers others scarce to be met with, otherwise then Scatter'd among many Chymical Books. And to Find these Associated Unnumbered pageExperiments so Deliver'd as that an Ordinary Reader, if he be but Acquainted with the usuall Chymical Termes, may easily enough Understand Them; and even a wary One may safely rely on Them. These Things I add, because a Person any Thing vers'd in the Writings of Chymists cannot but Discern by their obscure, ambiguous, and almost Aenigmatical Way of expressing what they pretend to Teach, that they have no Mind to be understood at all, but by the Sons of Art (as they call them) nor to be Understood even by these without Difficulty and Hazardous Tryalls. Insomuch that some of Them Scarce ever speak so candidly, as when they make use of that known Chymical Sentence; Ubi palam locuti sumus, ibi nihil diximus. And as the obscurity of what some Writers deliver makes it very difficult to be understood; so the Unfaithfulness of too many others makes it unfit to be reli'd on. For though unwillingly, Yet I must for the truths sake, and the Readers, warne him not to be forward to believe Chymical Experiments when they are set down only by way of Prescriptions, and not of Relations; that is, unless he that delivers them mentions his doing it upon his own particular knowledge, or upon the Relation of some credible person, avowing it upon his own experience. For I Image 5 (unnumbered page)am troubled, I must complain, that even Eminent Writers, both Physitians and Philosophers, whom I can easily name, if it be requir'd, have of late suffer'd themselves to be so far impos'd upon, as to Publish and Build upon Chymical Experiments, which questionless they never try'd; for if they had, they would, as well as I, have found them not to be true. And indeed it were to be wish'd, that now that those begin to quote Chymical Experiments that are not themselves Acquainted with Chymical Operations, men would Leave off that Indefinite Way of Vouching the Chymists say this, or the Chymists affirme that, and would rather for each Experiment they alledge name the Author or Authors, upon whose credit they relate it; For, by this means they would secure themselves from the suspition of falshood (to which the other Practice Exposes them) and they would Leave the Reader to Judge of what is fit for him to Believe of what is Deliver'd, whilst they employ not their own great names to Countenance doubtfull Relations; and they will also do Justice to the Inventors or Publishers of true Experiments, as well as upon the Obtruders of false ones. Whereas by that general Way of quoting the Chymists, the candid Writer is Defrauded of the particular Praise, and the Impostor escapes the Personal Disgrace that is due to him. Unnumbered page The remaining Part of this Praeface must be imploy'd in saying something for Carneades, and something for my Self. And first, Carneades hopes that he will be thought to have disputed civilly and Modestly enough for one that was to play the Antagonist and the Sceptick. And if he any where seem to sleight his Adversaries Tenents and Arguments, he is willing to have it look'd upon as what he was induc'd to, not so much by his Opinion of them, as the Examples of Themistius and Philoponus, and the custom of such kind of Disputes. Next, In case that some of his Arguments shall not be thought of the most Cogent sort that may be, he hopes it will be consider'd that it ought not to be Expected, that they should be So. For, his Part being chiefly but to propose Doubts and Scruples, he does enough, if he shews that his Adversaries Arguments are not strongly Concluding, though his own be not so neither. And if there should appear any disagreement betwixt the things he delivers in divers passages, he hopes it will be consider'd, that it is not necessary that all the things a Sceptick Proposes, should be consonant; since it being his work to Suggest doubts against the Opinion he questions, it is allowable for him to propose two or more severall Hypotheses about the same thing: And to Image 6 (unnumbered page)say that it may be accounted for this way, or that way, or the other Way, though these wayes be perhaps inconsistent among Themselves. Because it is enough for him, if either of the proposed Hypotheses be but as probable as that he calls a question. And if he proposes many that are Each of them probable, he does the more satisfie his doubts, by making it appear the more difficult to be sure, that that which they alwayes differ from is the true. And our Garneades by holding the Negative, he has this Advantage, that if among all the Instances he brings to invalidate all the Vulgar Doctrine of those he Disputes with, any one be Irrefragable, that alone is sufficient to overthrow a Doctrine which Universally asserts what he opposes. For, it cannot be true, that all Bodies whatsoever that are reckon'd among the Perfectly mixt Ones, are Compounded of such a Determinate Number of such or such Ingredients, in case any one such Body can be produc'd, that is not so compounded; and he hopes too, that Accurateness will be the less expected from him, because his undertaking obliges him to maintain such Opinions in Chymistry, and that chiefly by Chymical Arguments, as are Contrary to the very Principles of the Chymists; From whose writings it is not Therefore like he should receive any intentionall Assistance, except from some Passages of the Bold and Ingenious Helmont, Unnumbered pagewith whom he yet disagrees in many things (which reduce him to explicate Divers Chymical Phaenomena, according to other Notions;) And of whose Ratiocinations, not only some seem very Extravagant, but even the Rest are not wont to be as considerable as his Experiments. And though it be True indeed, that some Aristotelians have occasionally written against the Chymical Doctrine he Oppugnes, yet since they have done it according to their Principles, And since our Carneades must as well oppose their Hypothesis as that of the Spagyrist, he was fain to fight his Adversaries with their own Weapons, Those of the Peripatetick being Improper, if not hurtfull for a Person of his Tenents; besides that those Aristotelians, (at Least, those he met with,) that have written against the Chymists, seem to have had so little Experimental Knowledge in Chymical Matters, that by their frequent Mistakes and unskilfull Way of Oppugning, they have too often expos'd Themselves to the Derision of their Adversaries, for writing so Confidently against what they appear so little to understand. And Lastly, Carneades hopes, he shall doe the Ingenious this Piece of service, that by having Thus drawn the Chymists Doctrine out of their Dark and Smoakie Laboratories, and both brought it into the open light, and shewn the weakness Image 7 (unnumbered page)of their Proofs, that have hitherto been wont to be brought for it, either Judicious Men shall henceforth be allowed calmly and after due information to disbelieve it, or those abler Chymists, that are zealous for the reputation of it, will be oblig'd to speak plainer then hitherto has been done, and maintain it by better Experiments and Arguments then Those Carneades hath examin'd: so That he hopes, the Curious will one Way or other Derive either satisfaction or instruction from his endeavours. And as he is ready to make good the profession he makes in the close of his Discourse, he being ready to be better inform'd, so he expects either to be indeed inform'd, or to be let alone. For Though if any Truly knowing Chymists shall Think fit in a civil and rational way to shew him any truth touching the matter in Dispute That he yet discernes not, Carneades will not refuse either to admit, or to own a Conviction: yet if any impertinent Person shall, either to get Himself a Name, or for what other end soever, wilfully or carelesly mistake the State of the Controversie, G. and F. and H. and others, in their books against one another. or the sence of his Arguments, or shall rail instead of arguing, as hath been done of Late in Print by divers Chymists; or lastly, shall write against them in a canting way; I mean, shall express himself in ambiguous or obscure termes, or argue from experiments not intelligibly enough Unnumbered pageDeliver'd, Carneades professes, That he values his time so much, as not to think the answering such Trifles worth the loss of it. And now having said thus much for Carneades, I hope the Reader will give me leave to say something too for my self. And first, if some morose Readers shall find fault with my having made the Interlocutors upon occasion complement with one another, and that I have almost all along written these Dialogues in a stile more Fashionable then That of meer scholars is wont to be, I hope I shall be excus'd by them that shall consider, that to keep a due decorum in the Discourses, it was fit that in a book written by a Gentleman, and wherein only Gentlemen are introduc'd as speakers, the Language should be more smooth, and the Expressions more civil than is usual in the more Scholastick way of writing. And indeed, I am not sorry to have this Opportunity of giving an example how to manage even Disputes with Civility; whence perhaps some Readers will be assisted to discern a Difference betwixt Bluntness of speech and Strength of reason, and find that a man may be a Champion for Truth, without being an Enemy to Civility; and may confute an Opinion without railing at Them that hold it; To whom he that desires to convince and not to provoke them, must make some amends by his Civility Image 8 (unnumbered page)to their Persons, for his severity to their mistakes; and must say as little else as he can, to displease them, when he says that they are in an error. But perhaps other Readers will be less apt to find fault with the Civility of my Disputants, than the Chymists will be, upon the reading of some Passages of the following Dialogue, to accuse Carneades of Asperity. But if I have made my Sceptick sometimes speak sleightingly of the Opinions he opposes, I hope it will not be found that I have done any more, than became the Part he was to act of an Opponent: Especially, if what I have made him say be compar'd with what the Prince of the Romane Orators himself makes both great Persons and Friends say of one anothers Opinions, in his excellent Dialogues, De Natura Deorum: And I shall scarce be suspected of Partiality, in the case, by them that take Notice that there is full as much (if not far more) liberty of sleighting their Adversaries Tenents to be met with in the Discourses of those with whom Carneades disputes. Nor needed I make the Interlocutors speak otherwise then freely in a Dialogue, wherein it was sufficiently intimated, that I meant not to declare my own Opinion of the Arguments propos'd, much lesse of the whole Controversy it self otherwise than as it may by an attentive Reader be guess'd at by some Passages of Carneades: (I say, some Passages, because I make not all that he says, especially in the heat of Disputation, mine,) partly in this Discourse, and partly in some other Dialogues betwixt the same speakers (though they treat not immediately of the Elements) which have long Unnumbered pagelayn by me, and expect the Entertainment that these present Discourses will meet with. And indeed they will much mistake me, that shall conclude from what I now publish, that I am at Defyance with Chymistry, or would make my Readers so. I hope the Specimina I have lately publish'd of an attempt to shew the usefulness of Chymical Experiments to Contemplative Philosophers, will give those that shall read them other thoughts of me; & I had a design (but wanted opportunity) to publish with these Papers an Essay I have lying by me, the greater part of which is Apologetical for one sort of Chymists. And at least, as for those that know me, I hope the pain I have taken in the fire will both convince them, that I am far from being an Enemy to the Chymists Art, (though I am no friend to many that disgrace it by professing it,) and perswade them to believe me when I declare that I distinguish betwixt those Chymists that are either Cheats, or but Laborants, and the true Adepti; By whom, could I enjoy their Conversation, I would both willingly and thankfully be instructed; especially concerning the Nature and Generation of Metals: And possibly, those that know how little I have remitted of my former addictedness to make Chymical Experiments, will easily believe, that one of the chief Designes of this Sceptical Discourse was, not so much to discredit Chymistry, as to give an occasion and a kind of necessity to the more knowing Artists to lay aside a little of their overgreat Reservedness, & either explicate or prove the Chymical Theory better than ordinary Chymists have done, or by enriching us with some of their nobler secrets Image 9 (unnumbered page)to evince that Their art is able to make amends even for the deficiencies of their Theory: And thus much I shall here make bold to add, that we shall much undervalue Chymistry, if we imagine, that it cannot teach us things farr more useful, not only to Physick but to Philosophy, than those that are hitherto known to vulgar Chymists. And yet as for inferiour Spagyrists themselves, they have by their labours deserv'd so well of the Common-wealth of Learning, that methinks 'tis Pity they should ever misse the Truth which they have so industriously sought. And though I be no Admirer of the Theorical Part of their Art, yet my conjectures will much deceive me, if the Practical Part be not much more cultivated than hitherto it has been, and do not both employ Philosophy and Philosophers, and help to make men such. Nor would I that have been diverted by other Studies as well as affairs, be thought to pretend being a profound Spagyrist, by finding so many faults in the Doctrine wherein the Generality of Chymists scruples not to Acquiesce: For besides that 'tis most commonly far easier to frame Objections against any propos'd Hypothesis, than to propose an Hypothesis not lyable to Objections (besides this I say) 'tis no such great matter, if whereas Beginners in Chymistry are commonly at once imbu'd with the Theory and Operations of their profession, I who had the Unnumbered pagegood Fortune to Learn the Operations from illiterate Persons, upon whose credit I was not Tempted to take up any opinion about them, should consider things with lesse prejudice, and consequently with other Eyes than the Generality of Learners; And should be more dispos'd to accommodate the Phaenomena that occur'd to me to other Notions than to those of the Spagyrists. And having at first entertain'd a suspition That the Vulgar Principles were lesse General and comprehensive, or lesse considerately Deduc'd from Chymical Operations, than was believ'd; it was not uneasie for me both to Take notice of divers Phaenomena, overlook'd by prepossest Persons, that seem'd not to suite so well with the Hermetical Doctrine; and to devise some Experiments likely to furnish me with Objections against it, not known to many, that having practis'd Chymistry longer perchance then I have yet liv'd, may have far more Experience, Than I, of particular processes. To conclude, whether the Notions I have propos'd, and the Experiments I have communicated, be considerable, or not, I willingly leave others to Judge; and This only I shall say for my Self, That I have endeavour'd to deliver matters of Fact, so faithfully, that I may as well assist the lesse skilful Readers to examine the Image 10 (unnumbered page)Chymical Hypothesis, as provoke the Spagyrical Philosophers to illustrate it: which if they do, and that either the Chymical opinion, or the Peripatetick, or any other Theory of the Elements differing from that I am most inclin'd to, shall be intelligibly explicated, and duly prov'd to me; what I have hitherto discours'd will not hinder it from making a Proselyte of a Person that Loves Fluctuation of Judgment little enough to be willing to be eas'd of it by any thing but Error.    Page 1 PHYSIOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS Touching The experiments wont to be employed to evince either the IV Peripatetick Elements, or the III Chymical Principles of Mixt Bodies. Part of the First Dialogue. I Perceive that divers of my Friends have thought it very strange to hear me speak so irresolvedly, as I have been wont to do, concerning those things which some take to be the Elements, and others to be the Principles of all mixt Bodies. But I blush not to acknowledge that I much lesse scruple to confess that I Doubt, when I do so, then Image 11 (page 2)to profess that I Know what I do not: And I should have much stronger Expectations then I dare yet entertain, to see Philosophy solidly establish't, if men would more carefully distinguish those things that they know, from those that they ignore or do but think, and then explicate clearly the things they conceive they understand, acknowledge ingenuously what it is they ignore, and profess so candidly their Doubts, that the industry of intelligent persons might be set on work to make further enquiries, and the easiness of less discerning Men might not be impos'd on. But because a more particular accompt will probably be expected of my unsatisfyedness not only with the Peripatetick, but with the Chymical Doctrine of the Primitive Ingredients of Bodies: It may possibly serve to satisfy others of the excusableness of my disatisfaction to peruse the ensuing Relation of what passed a while since at a meeting of persons of several opinions, in a place that need not here be named; where the subject whereof we have been speaking, was amply and variously discours'd of. Page 3 It was on one of the fairest dayes of this Summer that the inquisitive Eleutherius came to invite me to make a visit with him to his friend Carneades. I readily consented to this motion, telling him that if he would but permit me to go first and make an excuse at a place not far off, where I had at that hour appointed to meet, but not about a business either of moment, or that could not well admit of a delay, I would presently wait on him, because of my knowing Carneades to be so conversant with nature and with Furnaces, and so unconfin'd to vulgar Opinions, that he would probably by some ingenious Paradox or other, give our mindes at least a pleasing Exercise, and perhaps enrich them with some solid instruction. Eleutherius then first going with me to the place where my Apology was to be made, I accompanied him to the lodging of Carneades, where when we were come, we were told by the Servants, that he was retired with a couple of Friends (whose names they also told us) to one of the Arbours in his Garden, to enjoy under its coole shades a delightful protection from the yet troublesome heat of the Sun. Image 12 (page 4) Eleutherius being perfectly acquainted with that Garden immediately led me to the Arbour, and relying on the intimate familiarity that had been long cherish'd betwixt him and Carneades; in spight of my Reluctancy to what might look like an intrusion upon his privacy, drawing me by the hand, he abruptly entered the Arbour, where we found Carneades, Philoponus, and Themistius, sitting close about a little round Table, on which besides paper, pen, and inke, there lay two or three open Books; Carneades appeared not at all troubled at this surprise, but rising from the Table, received his Friend with open looks and armes, and welcoming me also with his wonted freedom and civility, invited us to rest our selves by him, which, as soon as we had exchanged with his two Friends (who were ours also) the civilities accustomed on such occasions, we did. And he presently after we had seated our selves, shutting the Books that lay open, and turning to us with a smiling countenance seemed ready to begin some such unconcerning discourse as is wont to pass or rather waste the time in promiscuous companies. Page 5 But Eleutherius guessing at what he meant to do, prevented him by telling him, I perceive Carneades by the books that you have been now shutting, and much more by the posture wherein I found Persons qualifi'd to discourse of serious matters, and so accustom'd to do it, that you three were before our coming, engag'd in some Philosophical conference, which I hope you will either prosecute, and allow us to be partakers of, in recompence of the freedome we have us'd in presuming to surprise you, or else give us leave to repair the injury we should otherwise do you, by leaving you to the freedom we have interrupted, and punishing our selves for our boldness by depriving our selves of the happiness of your company. With these last words he and I rose up, as if we meant to be gone, But Carneades suddenly laying hold on his arme, and stopping him by it, smileingly told him, We are not so forward to lose good company as you seem to imagine; especially since you are pleas'd to desire to be present at what we shall say, about such a Subject as that You found us considering. For that, being Image 13 (page 6)the number of the Elements, Principles, or Materiall Ingredients of Bodies, is an enquiry whose truth is of that Importance, and of that Difficulty, that it may as well deserve as require to be searched into by such skilfull Indagators of Nature as your selves. And therefore we sent to invite the bold and acute Leucippus to lend us some light by his Atomical Paradox, upon which we expected such pregnant hints, that 'twas not without a great deal of trouble that we had lately word brought us that he was not to be found; and we had likewise begg'd the Assistance of your presence and thoughts, had not the messenger we employ'd to Leucippus inform'd us, that as he was going, he saw you both pass by towards another part of the Town; And this frustrated expectation of Leucippus his company, who told me but last night that he would be ready to give me a meeting where I pleas'd to day, having very long suspended our conference about the freshly mention'd Subject, it was so newly begun when you came in, that we shall scarce need to repeat any thing to acquaint you with what has pass'd betwixt us before Page 7your arrival, so that I cannot but look upon it as a fortunate Accident that you should come so seasonably, to be not hearers alone, but we hope Interlocutors at our conference. For we shall not only allow of your presence at it, but desire your Assistance in it; which I adde both for other reasons, and because though these learned Gentlemen (sayes he, turning to his two friends) need not fear to discourse before any Auditory, provided it be intelligent enough to understand them, yet for my part (continues he with a new smile,) I shall not dare to vent my unpremeditated thoughts before two such Criticks, unless by promising to take your turnes of speaking, You will allow me mine of quarrelling, with what has been said. He and his friends added divers things to convince us that they were both desirous that we should hear them, and resolved against our doing so, unless we allowed them sometimes to hear us. Elutherius after having a while fruitlesly endeavoured to obtain leave to be silent promis'd he would not be so alwayes, provided that he were permitted according to the freedom of his Image 14 (page 8)Genious and Principles to side with one of them in the managing of one Argument, and, if he saw cause, with his Antagonist, in the Prosecution of another, without being confin'd to stick to any one party or Opinion, which was after some debate accorded him. But I conscious to my own Disability's told them resolutely that I was as much more willing as more fit to be a hearer then a speaker, among such knowing Persons, and on so abstruse a Subject. And that therefore I beseeched them without necessitating me to proclaim my weaknesses, to allow me to lessen them by being a silent Auditor of their Discourses: to suffer me to be at which I could present them no motive, save that their instructions would make them in me a more intelligent Admirer. I added, that I desir'd not to be idle whilst they were imploy'd, but would if they pleas'd, by writing down in short hand what should be delivered, preserve Discourses that I knew would merit to be lasting. At first Carneades and his two friends utterly rejected this motion; and all that my Resoluteness to make use of my ears, not Page 9tongue, at their debates, could do, was to make them acquiesce in the Proposition of Eleutherius, who thinking himself concern'd, because he brought me thither, to afford me some faint assistance, was content that I should register their Arguments, that I might be the better able after the conclusion of their conference to give them my sence upon the Subject of it, (The number of Elements or Principles:) which he promis'd I should do at the end of the present Debates, if time would permit, or else at our next meeting. And this being by him undertaken in my name, though without my consent, the company would by no means receive my Protestation against it, but casting, all at once, their eyes on Carneades, they did by that and their unanimous silence, invite him to begin; which (after a short pause, during which he turn'd himself to Eleutherius and me) he did in this manner. Notwithstanding the subtile reasonings I have met with in the books of the Peripateticks, and the pretty experiments that have been shew'd me in the Laboratories of Chymists, I am of so Image 15 (page 10)diffident, or dull a Nature, as to think that if neither of them can bring more cogent arguments to evince the truth of their assertion then are wont to be brought; a Man may rationally enough retain some doubts concerning the very number of those materiall Ingredients of mixt bodies, which some would have us call Elements, and others principles. Indeed when I considered that the Tenents concerning the Elements are as considerable amongst the Doctrines of natural Philosophy as the Elements themselves are among the bodies of the Universe, I expected to find those Opinions solidly establish'd, upon which so many others are superstructed. But when I took the pains impartially to examine the bodies themselves that are said to result from the blended Elements, and to torture them into a confession of their constituent Principles, I was quickly induc'd to think that the number of the Elements has been contended about by Philosophers with more earnestness then success. This unsatisfiedness of mine has been much wonder'd at, by these two Gentlemen (at which words he pointed at Themistius Page 11and Philoponus) who though they differ almost as much betwixt themselves about the question we are to consider, as I do from either of them, yet they both agree very well in this, that there is a determinate number of such ingredients as I was just now speaking of, and that what that number is, I say not, may be (for what may not such as they perswade?) but is wont to be clearly enough demonstrated both by Reason and Experience. This has occasion'd our present Conference. For our Discourse this afternoon, having fallen from one subject to another, and at length setl'd on this, they proffer'd to demonstrate to me, each of them the truth of his opinion, out of both the Topicks that I have freshly nam'd. But on the former (that of Reason strictly so taken) we declin'd insisting at the present, lest we should not have time enough before supper to go thorough the Reasons and Experiments too. The latter of which we unanimously thought the most requisite to be seriously examin'd. I must desire you then to take notice Gentlemen (continued Carneades) that my present business doth not Image 16 (page 12)oblige me so to declare my own opinion on the Subject in question, as to assert or deny the truth either of the Peripatetick, or the Chymical Doctrine concerning the number of the Elements, but only to shew you that neither of these Doctrines hath been satisfactorily proved by the arguments commonly alledged on its behalfe. So that if I really discern (as perhaps I think I do) that there may be a more rational account then ordinary, given of one of these opinions, I am left free to declare my self of it, notwithstanding my present engagement, it being obvious to all your observation, that a solid truth may be generally maintained by no other, then incompetent Arguments. And to this Declaration I hope it will be needless to add, that my task obliges me not to answer the Arguments that may be drawn either for Themistius or Philoponus's Opinion from the Topick of reason, as opposed to experiments; since 'tis these only that I am to examine and not all these neither, but such of them alone as either of them shall think fit to insist on, and as have hitherto been wont to be brought either to prove that 'tis Page 13the four Peripatetick Elements, or that 'tis the three Chymical Principles that all compounded bodies consist of. These things (adds Carneades) I thought my self obliged to premise, partly lest you should do these Gentlemen (pointing at Themistius and Philoponus, and smiling on them) the injury of measuring their parts by the arguments they are ready to propose, the lawes of our Conference confining them to make use of those that the vulgar of Philosophers (for even of them there is a vulgar) has drawn up to their hands; and partly, that you should not condemn me of presumption for disputing against persons over whom I can hope for no advantage, that I must not derive from the nature, or rules of our controversy, wherein I have but a negative to defend, and wherein too I am like on several occasions to have the Assistance of one of my disagreeing adversaries against the other. Philoponus and Themistius soon returned this complement with civilities of the like nature, in which Eleutherius perceiving them engaged, to prevent the further loss of that time of which they were not like to have very much to spare, he Image 17 (page 14)minded them that their present businesse was not to exchange complements, but Arguments: and then addressing his speech to Carneades, I esteem it no small happinesse (saies he) that I am come here so luckily this Evening. For I have been long disquieted with Doubts concerning this very subject which you are now ready to debate. And since a Question of this importance is to be now discussed by persons that maintain such variety of opinions concerning it, and are both so able to enquire after truth, and so ready to embrace it by whomsoever and on what occasion soever it is presented them; I cannot but promise my self that I shall before we part either lose my Doubts or the hopes of ever finding them resolved: Eleutherius paused not here; but to prevent their answer, added almost in the same breath; and I am not a little pleased to find that you are resolved on this occasion to insist rather on Experiments then Syllogismes. For I, and no doubt You, have long observed, that those Dialectical subtleties, that the Schoolmen too often employ about Physiological Mysteries, are wont much more to declare the wit of him Page 15that uses them, then increase the knowledge or remove the doubts of sober lovers of truth. And such captious subtleties do indeed often puzzle and sometimes silence men, but rarely satisfy them. Being like the tricks of Jugglers, whereby men doubt not but they are cheated, though oftentimes they cannot declare by what slights they are imposed on. And therefore I think you have done very wisely to make it your businesse to consider the Phaenomena relating to the present Question, which have been afforded by experiments, especially since it might seem injurious to our senses, by whose mediation we acquire so much of the knowledge we have of things corporal, to have recourse to far-fetched and abstracted Ratiocination, to know what are the sensible ingredients of those sensible things that we daily see and handle, and are supposed to have the liberty to untwist (if I may so speak) into the primitive bodies they consist of. He annexed that he wished therefore they would no longer delay his expected satisfaction, if they had not, as he feared they had, forgotten something preparatory to their debate; and that was to Image 18 (page 16)lay down what should be all along understood by the word Principle or Element. Carneades thank'd him for his admonition, but told him that they had not been unmindful of so requisite a thing. But that being Gentlemen and very far from the litigious humour of loving to wrangle about words or terms or notions as empty; they had before his coming in, readily agreed promiscuously to use when they pleased, Elements and Principles as terms equivalent: and to understand both by the one and the other, those primitive and simple Bodies of which the mixt ones are said to be composed, and into which they are ultimately resolved. And upon the same account (he added) we agreed to discourse of the opinions to be debated, as we have found them maintained by the Generality of the assertors of the four Elements of the one party, and of those that receive the three Principles on the other, without tying our selves to enquire scrupulously what notion either Aristotle or Paracelsus, or this or that Interpreter, or follower of either of those great persons, framed of Elements or Principles; our design being to examine, not what these Page 17or those writers thought or taught, but what we find to be the obvious and most general opinion of those, who are willing to be accounted Favourers of the Peripatetick or Chymical Doctrine, concerning this subject. I see not (saies Eleutherius) why you might not immediately begin to argue, if you were but agreed which of your two friendly Adversaries shall be first heard. And it being quickly resolv'd on that Themistius should first propose the Proofs for his Opinion, because it was the antienter, and the more general, he made not the company expect long before he thus addressed himself to Eleutherius, as to the Person least interessed in the dispute. If you have taken sufficient notice of the late Confession which was made by Carneades, and which (though his Civility dressed it up in complementall Expressions) was exacted of him by his Justice, I suppose You will be easily made sensible, that I engage in this Controversie with great and peculiar Disadvantages, besides those which his Parts and my Personal Disabilities would bring to any other cause to be Image 19 (page 18)maintained by me against him. For he justly apprehending the force of truth, though speaking by no better a tongue then mine, has made it the chief condition of our Duell, that I should lay aside the best Weapons I have, and those I can best handle; Whereas if I were allowed the freedom, in pleading for the four Elements, to employ the Arguments suggested to me by Reason to demonstrare them, I should almost as little doubt of making You a Proselyte to those unsever'd Teachers, Truth and Aristotle, as I do of your Candour and your Judgment. And I hope you will however consider, that that great Favorite and Interpreter of Nature, Aristotle, who was (as his Organum witnesses) the greatest Master of Logick that ever liv'd, disclaim'd the course taken by other petty Philosophers (Antient and Modern) who not attending the Coherence and Consequences of their Opinions, are more sollicitous to make each particular Opinion plausible independently upon the the rest, then to frame them all so, as not only to be consistent together, but to support each other. For that great Page 19Man in his vast and comprehensive Intellect, so fram'd each of his Notions, that being curiously adapted into one Systeme, they need not each of them any other defence then that which their mutuall Coherence gives them: As 'tis in an Arch, where each single stone, which if sever'd from the rest would be perhaps defenceless, is sufficiently secur'd by the solidity and entireness of the whole Fabrick of which it is a part. How justly this may be apply'd to the present case, I could easily shew You, if I were permitted to declare to You, how harmonious Aristotles Doctrine of the Elements is with his other Principles of Philosophy; and how rationally he has deduc'd their number from that of the combinations of the four first Qualities from the kinds of simple Motion belonging to simple bodies, and from I know not how many other Principles and Phaenomena of Nature, which so conspire with his Doctrine of the Elements, that they mutually strengthen and support each other. But since 'tis forbidden me to insist on Reflections of this kind, I must proceed to tell You, that though the Image 20 (page 20)Assertors of the four Elements value Reason so highly, and are furnish'd with Arguments enough drawn from thence, to be satisfi'd that there must be four Elements, though no Man had ever yet made any sensible tryal to discover their Number, yet they are not destitute of Experience to satisfie others that are wont to be more sway'd by their senses then their Reason. And I shall proceed to consider the testimony of Experience, when I shall have first advertis'd You, that if Men were as perfectly rational as 'tis to be wish'd they were, this sensible way of Probation would be as needless as 'tis wont to be imperfect. For it is much more high and Philosophical to discover things a priore, then a posteriore. And therefore the Peripateticks have not been very sollicitous to gather Experiments to prove their Doctrines, contenting themselves with a few only, to satisfie those that are not capable of a Nobler Conviction. And indeed they employ Experiments rather to illustrate then to demonstrate their Doctrines, as Astronomers use Sphaeres of pastboard, to descend to the capacities Page 21of such as must be taught by their senses, for want of being arriv'd to a clear apprehension of purely Mathematical Notions and Truths. I speak thus Eleutherius (adds Themistius) only to do right to Reason, and not out of Diffidence of the Experimental proof I am to alledge. For though I shall name but one, yet it is such a one as will make all other appear as needless as it self will be found Satisfactory. For if You but consider a piece of green-Wood burning in a Chimney, You will readily discern in the disbanded parts of it the four Elements, of which we teach It and other mixt bodies to be compos'd. The fire discovers it self in the flame by its own light; the smoke by ascending to the top of the chimney, and there readily vanishing into air, like a River losing it self in the Sea, sufficiently manifests to what Element it belongs and gladly returnes. The water in its own form boyling and hissing at the ends of the burning Wood betrayes it self to more then one of our senses; and the ashes by their weight, their firiness, and their dryness, put it past doubt that they belong to the Element Image 21 (page 22)of Earth. If I spoke (continues Themistius) to less knowing Persons, I would perhaps make some Excuse for building upon such an obvious and easie Analysis, but 'twould be, I fear, injurious, not to think such an Apology needless to You, who are too judicious either to think it necessary that Experiments to prove obvious truths should be farr fetch'd, or to wonder that among so many mixt Bodies that are compounded of the four Elements, some of them should upon a slight Analysis manifestly exhibite the Ingredients they consist of. Especially since it is very agreeable to the Goodness of Nature, to disclose, even in some of the most obvious Experiments that Men make, a Truth so important, and so requisite to be taken notice of by them. Besides that our Analysis by how much the more obvious we make it, by so much the more suittable it will be to the Nature of that Doctrine which 'tis alledged to prove, which being as clear and intelligible to the Understanding as obvious to the sense, tis no marvail the learned part of Mankind should so long and so generally imbrace it. For this Doctrine Page 23is very different from the whimseys of Chymists and other Modern Innovators, of whose Hypotheses we may observe, as Naturalists do of less perfect Animals, that as they are hastily form'd, so they are commonly short liv'd. For so these, as they are often fram'd in one week, are perhaps thought fit to be laughed at the next; and being built perchance but upon two or three Experiments are destroyed by a third or fourth, whereas the doctrine of the four Elements was fram'd by Aristotle after he had leasurely considered those Theories of former Philosophers, which are now with great applause revived, as discovered by these latter ages; And had so judiciously detected and supplyed the Errors and defects of former Hypotheses concerning the Elements, that his Doctrine of them has been ever since deservedly embraced by the letter'd part of Mankind: All the Philosophers that preceded him having in their several ages contributed to the compleatness of this Doctrine, as those of succeeding times have acquiesc'd in it. Nor has an Hypothesis so deliberately and maturely established been called in Question Image 22 (page 24)till in the last Century Paracelfus and some few other sooty Empiricks, rather then (as they are fain to call themselves) Philosophers, having their eyes darken'd, and their Brains troubl'd with the smoke of their own Furnaces, began to rail at the Peripatetick Doctrine, which they were too illiterate to understand, and to tell the credulous World, that they could see but three Ingredients in mixt Bodies; which to gain themselves the repute of Inventors, they endeavoured to disguise by calling them, instead of Earth, and Fire, and Vapour, Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury; to which they gave the canting title of Hypostatical Principles: but when they came to describe them, they shewed how little they understood what they meant by them, by disagreeing as much from one another, as from the truth they agreed in opposing: For they deliver their Hypotheses as darkly as their Processes; and 'tis almost as impossible for any sober Man to find their meaning, as 'tis for them to find their Elixir. And indeed nothing has spread their Philosophy, but their great Brags and undertakings; notwithstanding all which, (sayes Themistius Page 25smiling) I scarce know any thing they have performed worth wondering at, save that they have been able to draw Philoponus to their Party, and to engage him to the Defence of an unintelligible Hypothesis, who knowes so well as he does, that Principles ought to be like Diamonds, as well very clear, as perfectly solid. Themistius having after these last words declared by his silence, that he had finished his Discourse, Carneades addressing himself, as his Adversary had done, to Eleutherius, returned this Answer to it. I hop'd for Demonstration, but I perceive Themistius hopes to put me off with a Harangue, wherein he cannot have given me a greater Opinion of his Parts, then he has given me Distrust for his Hypothesis, since for it even a Man of such Learning can bring no better Arguments. The Rhetorical part of his Discourse, though it make not the least part of it, I shall say nothing to, designing to examine only the Argumentative part, and leaving it to Philoponus to answer those passages wherein either Paracelsus or Chymists are concern'd: I shall observe to You, that in what he has said Image 23 (page 26)besides, he makes it his Business to do these two things. The one to propose and make out an Experiment to demonstrate the common Opinion about the four Elements; And the other, to insinuate divers things which he thinks may repair the weakness of his Argument, from Experience, and upon other Accounts bring some credit to the otherwise defenceless Doctrine he maintains. To begin then with his Experiment of the burning Wood, it seems to me to be obnoxious to not a few considerable Exceptions. And first, if I would now deal rigidly with my Adversary, I might here make a great Question of the very way of Probation which he and others employ, without the least scruple, to evince, that the Bodies commonly call'd mixt, are made up of Earth, Air, Water, and Fire, which they are pleas'd also to call Elements; namely that upon the suppos'd Analysis made by the fire, of the former sort of Concretes, there are wont to emerge Bodies resembling those which they take for the Elements. For not to Anticipate here what I foresee I Page 27shall have occasion to insist on, when I come to discourse with Philoponus concerning the right that fire has to pass for the proper and Universal Instrument of Analysing mixt Bodies, not to Anticipate that, I say, if I were dispos'd to wrangle, I might alledge, that by Themistius his Experiment it would appear rather that those he calls Elements, are made of those he calls mixt Bodies, then mix'd Bodies of the Elements. For in Themistius's Analyz'd Wood, and in other Bodies dissipated and alter'd by the fire, it appears, and he confesses, that which he takes for Elementary Fire and Water, are made out of the Concrete; but it appears not that the Concrete was made up of Fire and Water. Nor has either He, or any Man, for ought I know, of his perswasion, yet prov'd that nothing can be obtained from a Body by the fire that was not Pre-existent in it. At this unexpected objection, not only Themistius, but the rest of the company appear'd not a little surpriz'd; but after a while Philoponus conceiving his opinion, as well as that of Aristotle, concern'd in that Objection, You cannot sure Image 24 (page 28)(sayes he to Carneades) propose this Difficulty, not to call it Cavill, otherwise then as an Exercise of wit, and not as laying any weight upon it. For how can that be separated from a thing that was not existent in it. When, for instance, a Refiner mingles Gold and Lead, and exposing this Mixture upon a Cuppell to the violence of the fire, thereby separates it into pure and resulgent Gold and Lead (which driven off together with the Dross of the Gold is thence call'd Lithargyrium Auri) can any man doubt that sees these two so differing substances separated from the Mass, that they were existent in it before it was committed to the fire. I should (replies Carneades) allow your Argument to prove something, if, as Men see the Refiners commonly take before hand both Lead and Gold to make the Mass you speak of, so we did see Nature pull down a parcell of the Element of Fire, that is fancy'd to be plac'd I know not how many thousand Leagues off, contiguous to the Orb of the Moon, and to blend it with a quantity of each of the three other Elements, to compose every mixt Body, upon whose Resolution the Page 29Fire presents us with Fire, and Earth, and the rest. And let me add, Philoponus, that to make your Reasoning cogent, it must be first prov'd, that the fire do's only take the Elementary Ingredients asunder, without otherwise altering them. For else 'tis obvious, that Bodies may afford substances which were not pre-existent in them; as Flesh too long kept produces Magots, and old Cheese Mites, which I suppose you will not affirm to be Ingredients of those Bodies. Now that fire do's not alwayes barely separate the Elementary parts, but sometimes at least alter also the Ingredients of Bodies, if I did not expect ere long a better occasion to prove it, I might make probable out of your very Instance, wherein there is nothing Elementary separated by the great violence of the Refiners fire: the Gold and Lead which are the two Ingredients separated upon the Analysis being confessedly yet perfectly mixt Bodies, and the Litharge being Lead indeed; but such Lead as is differing in consistence and other Qualities from what it was before. To which I must add that I have sometimes seen, and so questionlesse have you Image 25 (page 30)much oftener, some parcells of Glasse adhering to the Test or Cuppel, and this Glass though Emergent as well as the Gold or Litharge upon your Analysis, you will not I hope allow to have been a third Ingredient of the Mass out of which the fire produc'd it. Both Philoponus and Themistius were about to reply, when Eleutherius apprehending that the Prosecution of this Dispute would take up time, which might be better employ d, thought fit to prevent them by saying to Carneades: You made at least half a Promise, when you first propos'd this Objection, that you would not (now at least) insist on it, nor indeed does it seem to be of absolute necessity to your cause, that you should. For though you should grant that there are Elements, it would not follow that there must be precisely four. And therefore I hope you will proceed to acquaint us with your other and more considerable Objections against Themistius's Opinion, especially since there is so great a Disproportion in Bulke betwixt the Earth, Water and Air, on the one part, and those little parcells of resembling substances, that the fire separates Page 31from Concretes on the other part, that I can scarce think that you are serious, when to lose no advantage against your Adversary, you seem to deny it to be rational, to conclude these great simple Bodies to be the Elements, and not the Products of compounded ones. What you alledge (replies Carneades) of the Vastness of the Earth and Water, has long since made me willing to allow them to be the greatest and chief Masses of Matter to be met with here below: But I think I could shew You, if You would give me leave, that this will prove only that the Elements, as You call them, are the chief Bodies that make up the neighbouring part of the World, but not that they are such Ingredients as every mixt Body must consist of. But since You challenge me of something of a Promise, though it be not an entire one, Yet I shall willingly perform it. And indeed I intended not when I first mention'd this Objection, to insist on it at present against Themistius, (as I plainly intimated in my way of proposing it:) being only desirous to let you see, that though I discern'd my Advantages, yet Image 26 (page 32)I was willing to forego some of them; rather then appear a rigid Adversary of a Cause so weak, that it may with safety be favourably dealt with. But I must here profess, and desire You to take Notice of it, that though I pass on to another Argument, it is not because I think this first invalid. For You will find in the Progress of our Dispute, that I had some reason to question the very way of Probation imploy'd both by Peripateticks and Chymists, to evince the being and number of the Elements. For that there are such, and that they are wont to be separated by the Analysis made by Fire, is indeed taken for granted by both Parties, but has not (for ought I know) been so much as plausibly attempted to be proved by either. Hoping then that when we come to that part of our Debate, wherein Considerations relating to this Matter are to be treated of, you will remember what I have now said, and that I do rather for a while suppose, then absolutely grant the truth of what I have question'd, I will proceed to another Objection. And hereupon Eleutherius having Page 33mis'd him not to be unmindfull, when time should serve, of what he had declar'd. I consider then (sayes Carneades) in the next place, that there are divers Bodies out of which Themistius will not prove in haste, that there can be so many Elements as four extracted by the Fire. And I should perchance trouble him if I should ask him what Peripatetick can shew us, (I say not, all the four Elements, for that would be too rigid a Question, but) any one of them extracted out of Gold by any degree of Fire whatsoever. Nor is Gold the only Bodie in Nature that would puzzle an Aristotelian, that is no more to analyze by the Fire into Elementary Bodies, since, for ought I have yet observ'd, both Silver and calcin'd Venetian Talck, and some other Concretes, not necessary here to be nam'd, are so fixt, that to reduce any of them into four Heterogeneous Substances has hitherto prov'd a Task much too hard, not only for the Disciples of Aristotle, but those of Vulcan, at least, whilst the latter have employ'd only Fire to make the Analysis. The next Argument (continues Carneades) Image 27 (page 34)that I shall urge against Themistius's Opinion shall be this, That as there are divers Bodies whose Analysts by Fire cannot reduce them into so many Heterogeneous Substances or Ingregredients as four, so there are others which may be reduc'd into more, as the Blood (and divers other parts) of Men and other Animals, which yield when analyz'd five distinct Substances, Phlegme, Spirit, Oyle, Salt and Earth, as Experience has shewn us in distilling Mans Blood, Harts-Horns, and divers other Bodies that belonging to the Animal-Kingdom abound with not uneasily sequestrable Salt.

Crooke, and are to be sold at the Ship in St. Pauls Church-Yard. 1661.    Image 28 (unnumbered page) Page 35 THE SCEPTICAL CHYMIST. The First Part. I Am (sayes Carneades) so unwilling to deny Eleutherius any thing, that though, before the rest of the Company I am resolv'd to make good the part I have undertaken of a Sceptick; yet I shall readily, since you will have it so, lay aside for a while the Person of an Adversary to the Peripateticks and Chymists; and before I acquaint you with my Objections against their Opinions, acknowledge to you what may be (whether truly or not) tollerably enough added, in favour of a certain number of Principles of mixt Bodies, to that grand and known Argument from the Analysis Image 29 (page 36)of compound Bodies, which I may possibly hereafter be able to confute. And that you may the more easily Examine, and the better Judge of what I have to say, I shall cast it into a pretty number of distinct Propositions, to which I shall not premise any thing; because I take it for granted, that you need not be advertis'd, that much of what I am to deliver, whether for or against a determinate number of Ingredients of mix'd Bodies, may be indifferently apply'd to the four Peripatetick Elements, and the three Chymical Principles, though divers of my Objections will more peculiarly belong to these last nam'd, because the Chymical Hypothesis seeming to be much more countenanc'd by Experience then the other, it will be expedient to insist chiefly upon the disproving of that; especially since most of the Arguments that are imploy'd against it, may, by a little variation, be made to conclude, at least as strongly against the less plausible, Aristotelian Doctrine. To proceed then to my Propositions, I shall begin with this, That Page 37  It seems not absurd to conceive that at the first Production of mixt Bodies, the Universal Matter whereof they among other Parts of the Universe consisted, was actually divided into little Particles of several sizes and shapes variously mov'd. This (sayes Carneades) I suppose you will easily enough allow. For besides that which happens in the Generation, Corruption, Nutrition, and wasting of Bodies, that which we discover partly by our Microscopes of the extream littlenesse of even the scarce sensible parts of Concretes; and partly by the Chymical Resolutions of mixt Bodies, and by divers other Operations of Spagyrical Fires upon them, seems sufficiently to manifest their consisting of parts very minute and of differing Figures. And that there does also intervene a various local Motion of such small Bodies, will scarce be denied; whether we chuse to grant the Origine of Concretions assign'd by Epicurus, or that related by Moses. For the first, as you well know, supposes not only all Image 30 (page 38)mixt Bodies, but all others to be produc'd by the various and casual occursions of Atomes, moving themselves to and fro by an internal Principle in the Immense or rather Infinite Vacuum. And as for the inspir'd Historian, He, informing us that the great and Wise Author of Things did not immediately create Plants, Beasts, Birds, &c. but produc'd them out of those portions of the pre-existent, though created, Matter, that he calls Water and Earth, allows us to conceive, that the constituent Particles whereof these new Concretes were to consist, were variously moved in order to their being connected into the Bodies they were, by their various Coalitions and Textures, to compose. But (continues Carneades) presuming that the first Proposition needs not be longer insisted on, I will pass on to the second, and tell you that  Neither is it impossible that of these minute Particles divers of the smallest and neighbouring ones were here and there associated into minute Masses or Clusters, and did by their Coalitions constitute great store of such little primary Concretions Page 39or Masses as were not easily dissipable into such Particles as compos'd them. To what may be deduc'd, in favour of this Assertion, from the Nature of the Thing it self, I will add something out of Experience, which though I have not known it used to such a purpose, seems to me more fairly to make out that there May be Elementary Bodies, then the more questionable Experiments of Peripateticks and Chymists prove that there Are such. I consider then that Gold will mix and be colliquated not only with Silver, Copper, Tin and Lead, but with Antimony, Regulus Martis and many other Minerals, with which it will compose Bodies very differing both from Gold, and the other Ingredients of the resulting Concretes. And the same Gold will also by common Aqua Regis, and (I speak it knowingly) by divers other Menstruums be reduc'd into a seeming Liquor, in so much that the Corpuscles of Gold will, with those of the Menstruum, pass through Cap-Paper, and with them also coagulate into a Crystalline Salt. And I have further try'd, that Image 31 (page 40)with a small quantity of a certain Saline Substance I prepar'd, I can easily enough sublime Gold into the form of red Crystalls of a considerable length; and many other wayes may Gold be disguis'd, and help to constitute Bodies of very differing Natures both from It and from one another, and neverthelesse be afterward reduc'd to the self-same Numerical, Yellow, Fixt, Ponderous and Malleable Gold it was before its commixture. Nor is it only the fixedst of Metals, but the most fugitive, that I may employ in favour of our Proposition: for Quicksilver will with divers Metals compose an Amalgam, with divers Menstruums it seems to be turnd into a Liquor, with Aqua fortis it will be brought into either a red or white Powder or precipitate, with Oyl of Vitriol into a pale Yellow one, with Sulphur it will compose a bloodred and volatile Cinaber, with some Saline Bodies it will ascend in form of a Salt which will be dissoluble in water; with Regulus of Antimony and Silver I have seen it sublim'd into a kinde of Crystals, with another Mixture I reduc'd it into a malleable Body, into a hard and brittle Substance by another: And Page 41some there are who affirm, that by proper Additaments they can reduce Quicksilver into Oyl, nay into Glass, to mention no more. And yet out of all these exotick Compounds, we may recover the very same running Mercury that was the main Ingredient of them, and was so disguis'd in them. Now the Reason (proceeds Carneades) that I have represented these things concerning Gold and Quicksilver, is, That it may not appear absurd to conceive, that such little primary Masses or Clusters, as our Proposition mentions, may remain undissipated, notwithstanding their entring into the composition of various Concretions, since the Corpuscle of Gold and Mercury, though they be not primary Concretions of the most minute Particles of matter, but confessedly mixt Bodies, are able to concurre plentifully to the composition of several very differing Bodies, without losing their own Nature or Texture, or having their cohaesion violated by the divorce of their associated parts or Ingredients. Give me leave to add (sayes Eleutherius) on this occasion, to what you now observ'd, that as confidently as some Image 32 (page 42)Chymists, and other modern Innovators in Philosophy are wont to object against the Peripateticks, That from the mixture of their four Elements there could arise but an inconsiderable variety of compound Bodies; yet if the Aristotelians were but half as well vers'd in the works of Nature as they are in the Writings of their Master, the propos'd Objection would not so calmly triumph, as for want of Experiments they are fain to suffer it to do. For if we assigne to the Corpuscles, whereof each Element consists, a peculiar size and shape, it may easily enough be manifested, That such differingly figur'd Corpuscles may be mingled in such various Proportions, and may be connected so many several wayes, that an almost incredible number of variously qualified Concretes may be compos'd of them. Especially since the Corpuscles of one Element may barely, by being associated among themselves, make up little Masses of differing size and figure from their constituent parts: and since also to the strict union of such minute Bodies there seems oftentimes nothing requisite, besides the bare Contact of a great part of their Surfaces. Page 43And how great a variety of Phaenomena the same matter, without the addition of any other, and only several ways dispos'd or contexed, is able to exhibit, may partly appear by the multitude of differing Engins which by the contrivances of skilful Mechanilians, and the dexterity of expert Workmen, may be made of Iron alone. But in our present case being allow'd to deduce compound Bodies from four very differently qualified sorts of matter, he who shall but consider what you freshly took notice of concerning the new Concretes resulting from the mixture of incorporated Minerals, will scarce doubt but that the four Elements mannag'd by Natures Skill may afford a multitude of differing Compounds. I am thus far of your minde (sayes Carneades) that the Aristotelians might with probability deduce a much greater number of compound Bodies from the mixture of their four Elements, than according to their present Hypothesis they can, if instead of vainly attempting to deduce the variety and properties of all mixt Bodies from the Combinations and Temperaments of the four Elements, as they are (among them) endowd Image 33 (page 44)with the four first Qualities, they had endeavoured to do it by the Bulk and Figure of the smallest parts of those supposed Elements. For from these more Catholick and Fruitfull Accidents of the Elementary matter may spring a great variety of Textures, upon whose Account a multitude of compound Bodies may very much differ from one another. And what I now observe touching the four Peripatetick Elements, may be also applyed, mutatis mutandis, (as they speak) to the Chymical Principles. But (to take notice of that by the by) both the one and the other, must, I fear, call in to their assistance something that is not Elementary, to excite or regulate the motion of the parts of the matter, and dispose them after the manner requisite to the Constitution of particular Concretes. For that otherwise they are like to give us but a very imperfect account of the Origine of very many mixt Bodies, It would, I think, be no hard matter to perswade you, if it would not spend time, and were no Digression, to examine, what they are wont to alledge of the Origine of the Textures and Qualities of mixt Bodies, Page 45from a certain substantial Form, whose Origination they leave more obscure than what it is assum'd to explicate. But to proceed to a new Proposition.  I shall not peremptorily deny, that from most of such mixt Bodies as partake either of Animal or Vegetable Nature, there may by the Help of the Fire, be actually obtain'd a determinate number (whether Three, Four or Five, or fewer or more) of Substances, worthy of differing Denominations. Of the Experiments that induce me to make this Concession, I am like to have occasion enough to mention several in the prosecution of my Discourse. And therefore, that I may not hereafter be oblig'd to trouble You and my self with needless Repetitions, I shall now only desire you to take notice of such Experiments, when they shall be mention'd, and in your thoughts referre them hither. To these three Concessions I have but this Fourth to add, That Image 34 (page 46)  It may likewise be granted, that those distinct Substances, which Concretes generally either afford or are made up of, may without very much Inconvenience be call'd the Elements or Principles of them. When I said, without very much Inconvenience, I had in my Thoughts that sober Admonition of Galen, Cum de re constat, de verbis non est Litigandum. And therefore also I scruple not to say Elements or Principles, partly because the Chymists are wont to call the Ingredients of mixt Bodies, Principles, as the Aristotelians name them Elements; I would here exclude neither. And, partly, because it seems doubtfull whether the same Ingredients may not be call'd Principles? as not being compounded of any more primary Bodies: and Elements, in regard that all mix'd Bodies are compounded of them. But I thought it requisite to limit my Concession by premising the words, very much, to the word Inconvenience, because that though the Inconvenience of calling the distinct Substances, mention'd in the Proposition Elements or Principles, be not very great, Page 47yet that it is an Impropriety of Speech, and consequently in a matter of this moment not to be altogether overlook'd, You will perhaps think, as well as I, by that time you shall have heard the following part of my Discourse, by which you will best discern what Construction to put upon the former Propositions, and how far they may be look'd upon, as things that I concede as true, and how far as things I only represent as specious enough to be fit to be consider'd. And now Eleutherius (continues Carneades) I must resume the person of a Sceptick, and as such, propose some part of what may be either dislik't, or at least doubted of in the common Hypothesis of the Chymists: which if I examine with a little the more freedom, I hope I need not desire you (a Person to whom I have the Happinesse of being so well known) to look upon it as something more suitable to the Employment whereto the Company has, for this Meeting, doom'd me; then either to my Humour or my Custom. Now though I might present you many things against the Vulgar Chymical Opinion of the three Principles, and the Image 35 (page 48)Experiments wont to be alledg'd as Demonstrations of it, yet those I shall at present offer you may be conveniently enough comprehended in four Capital Considerations; touching all which I shall only premise this in general, That since it is not my present Task so much to assert an Hypothesis of my own, as to give an Account wherefore I suspect the Truth of that of the Chymists, it ought not to be expected that all my Objections should be of the most cogent sort, since it is reason enough to Doubt of a propos'd Opinion, that there appears no cogent Reason for it. To come then to the Objections themselves; I consider in the first place, That notwithstanding what common Chymists have prov'd or taught, it may reasonably enough be Doubted, how far, and in what sence, Fire ought to be esteem'd the genuine and universal Instrument of analyzing mixt Bodies. This Doubt, you may remember, was formerly mention'd, but so transiently discours'd of, that it will now be fit to insist upon it; And manifest that it was not so inconsiderately propos'd as our Adversaries then imagin'd. Page 49 But, before I enter any farther into this Disquisition, I cannot but here take notice, that it were to be wish'd, our Chymists had clearly inform'd us what kinde of Division of Bodies by Fire must determine the number of the Elements: For it is nothing near so easy as many seem to think, to determine distinctly the Effects of Heat, as I could easily manifest, if I had leasure to shew you how much the Operations of Fire may be diversify'd by Circumstances. But not wholly to pass by a matter of this Importance, I will first take notice to you, that Guajacum (for Instance) burnt with an open Fire in a Chimney, is sequestred into Ashes and Soot, whereas the same Wood distill'd in a Retort does yield far other Heterogeneities, (to use the Helmontian expression) and is resoly'd into Oyl, Spirit, Vinager, Water and Charcoal; the last of which to be reduc'd into Ashes, requires the being farther calcin'd then it can be in a close Vessel: Besides having kindled Amber, and held a clean Silver Spoon, or some other Concave and smooth Vessel over the Smoak of its Flame, I observ'd the Soot into which that Fume condens'd, Image 36 (page 50)to be very differing from any thing that I had observ'd to proceed from the steam of Amber purposely (for that is not usual) distilled per se in close Vessels. Thus having, for Tryals sake, kindled Camphire, and catcht the Smoak that copiously ascended out of the Flame, it condens'd into a Black and unctuous Soot, which would not have been guess d by the Smell or other Properties to have proceeded from Camphire: whereas having (as I shall otherwhere more fully declare) expos'd a quantity of that Fugitive Concrete to a gentle heat in a close Glass-Vessel, it sublim'd up without seeming to have lost any thing of its whiteness, or its Nature, both which it retain'd, though afterwards I so encreased the Fire as to bring it to Fusion. And, besides Camphire, there are divers other Bodies (that I elsewhere name) in which the heat in close Vessels is not wont to make any separation of Heterogeneities, but only a comminution of Parts, those that rise first being Homogeneal with the others, though subdivided into smaller Particles: whence Sublimations have been stiled, The Pestles of the Chymists. But not here Page 51to mention what I elsewhere take notice of, concerning common Brimstone once or twice sublim'd, that expos'd to a moderate Fire in Subliming-Pots, it rises all into dry, and almost tastless, Flowers; Whereas being expos'd to a naked Fire it affords store of a Saline and Fretting Liquor: Not to mention this, I say, I will further observe to you, that as it is considerable in the Analysis of mixt Bodies, whether the Fire act on them when they are expos'd to the open Air, or shut up in close Vessels, so is the degree of Fire by which the Analysis is attempted of no small moment. For a milde Balneum will sever unfermented Blood (for Instance) but into Phlegme and Caput mortuum, the later whereof (which I have sometimes had) hard, brittle, and of divers Colours, (transparent almost like Tortoise-shell) press'd by a good Fire in a Retort yields a Spirit, an Oyl or two, and a volatile Salt, besides a Caput mortuum. It may be also pertinent to our present Designe, to take notice of what happens in the making and distilling of Sope; for by one degree of Fire the Salt, the Water and the Oyl or Grease, whereof that factitious Image 37 (page 52)Concrete is made up, being boyl'd up together are easily brought to mingle and incorporate into one Mass; but by another and further degree of Heat the same Mass may be again divided into an oleagenous, an aqueous, a Saline, and an Earthy part. And so we may observe that impure Silver and Lead being expos'd together to a moderate Fire, will thereby be colliquated into one Mass, and mingle per minima, as they speak, whereas a much vehementer Fire will drive or carry off the baser Metals (I mean the Lead, and the Copper or other Alloy) from the Silver, though not, for ought appears, separate them from one another. Besides, when a Vegetable abounding in fixt Salt is analyz'd by a naked Fire, as one degree of Heat will reduce it into Ashes, (as the Chymists themselves teach us) so, by only a further degree of Fire, those Ashes may be vitrified and turn'd into Glass. I will not stay to examine how far a meere Chymist might on this occasion demand, If it be lawful for an Aristotelian to make Ashes, (which he mistakes for meere Earth) pass for an Element, because by one degree of Fire it may be Page 53produc'd, why a Chymist may not upon the like Principle argue, that Glass is one of the Elements of many Bodies, because that also may be obtain'd from them, barely by the Fire? I will not, I say, lose time to examine this, but observe, that by a Method of applying the Fire, such similar Bodies may be obtain'd from a Concrete, as Chymists have not been able to separate; either by barely burning it in an open Fire, or by barely distilling it in close Vessels. For to me it seems very considerable, and I wonder that men have taken so little notice of it, that I have not by any of the common wayes of Distillation in close Vessels, seen any separation made of such a volatile Salt as is afforded us by Wood, when that is first by an open Fire divided into Ashes and Soot, and that Soot is afterwards plac'd in a strong Retort, and compell'd by an urgent Fire to part with its Spirit, Oyl and Salt; for though I dare not peremptorily deny, that in the Liquors of Guajacum and other Woods distill'd in Retorts after the common manner, there may be Saline parts, which by reason of the Analogy may pretend to the name of some kinde of Image 38 (page 54)volatile Salts; yet questionless there is a great disparity betwixt such Salts and that which we have sometimes obtain'd upon the first Distillation of Soot (though for the most part it has not been separated from the first or second Rectification, and sometimes not till the third) For we could never yet see separated from Woods analyz'd only the vusgar way in close vessels any volatile Salt in a dry and Saline form, as that of Soot, which we have often had very Crystalline and Geometrically figur'd. And then, whereas the Saline parts of the Spirits of Guajacum, &c. appear upon distillation sluggish enough, the Salt of Soot seems to be one of the most volatile Bodies in all Nature; and if it be well made will readily ascend with the milde heat of a Furnace, warm 'd only by the single Wieck of a Lamp, to the top of the highest Glass Vessels that are commonly made use of for Distillation: and besides all this, the taste and smell of the Salt of Soot are exceeding differing from those of the Spirits of Guajacum, &c. and the former not only smells and tastes much less like a vegetable Salt, than like that of Harts-horn, and other Page 55Animal Concretes; but in divers other Properties seems more of Kinne to the Family of Animals, than to that of vegetable Salts, as I may elsewhere (God permitting) have an occasion more particularly to declare. I might likewise by some other Examples manifest, That the Chymists, to have dealt clearly, ought to have more explicitly and particularly declar'd by what Degree of Fire, and in what manner of Application of it, they would have us Judge a Division made by the Fire to be a true Analysis into their Principles, and the Productions of it to deserve the name of Elementary Bodies. But it is time that I proceed to mention the particular Reasons that incline me to Doubt, whether the Fire be the true and universal Analyzer of mixt Bodies; of which Reasons what has been already objected may pass for one. In the next place I observe, That there are some mixt Bodies from which it has not been yet made appear, that any degree of Fire can separate either Salt or Sulphur or Mercury, much less all the Three. The most obvious Instance of this Truth is Gold, which is a Body so fix'd, and wherein the Elementary Image 39 (page 56)Ingredients (if it have any) are so firmly united to each other, that we finde not in the operations wherein Gold is expos'd to the Fire, how violent soever, that it does discernably so much as lose of its fixednesse or weight, so far is it from being dissipated into those Principles, whereof one at least is acknowledged to be Fugitive enough; and so justly did the Spagyricall Poet somewhere exclaim, Cuncta adeo miris illic compagibus haerent. And I must not omit on this occasion to mention to you, Eleutherius, the memorable Experiment that I remember I met with in Gasto Claveus Apolog. Argur. & Chrysopera. Gasto Claveus, who, though a Lawyer by Profession, seems to have had no small Curiosity and Experience in Chymical affairs: He relates then, that having put into one small Earthen Vessel an Ounce of the most pure Gold, and into another the like weight of pure Silver, he plac'd them both in that part of a Glass-house Furnace wherein the Workmen keep their Metal, (as our English Artificers call their Liquid Glass) continually melted, and that having there kept both the Gold and Page 57the Silver in constant Fusion for two Moneths together, he afterwards took them out of the Furnace and the Vessels, and weighing both of them again, found that the Silver had not lost above a 12th part of its weight, but the Gold had not of his lost any thing at all. And though our Author endeavours to give us of this a Scholastick Reason, which I suppose you would be as little satisfied with, as I was when I read it; yet for the matter of Fact, which will serve our present turne, he assures us, that though it be strange, yet Experience it self taught it him to be most true. And though there be not perhaps any other Body to be found so perfectly fix'd as Gold, yet there are divers others so fix'd or compos'd, at least of so strictly united parts, that I have not yet observ'd the Fire to separate from them any one of the Chymists Principles. I need not tell you what Complaints the more Candid and Judicious of the Chymists themselves are wont to make of those Boasters that confidently pretend, that they have extracted the Salt or Sulphur of Quicksilver, when they have disguis'd it by Additaments, wherewith it resembles Image 40 (page 58)the Concretes whose Names are given it; whereas by a skilfull and rigid Examen, it may be easily enough stript of its Disguises, and made to appear again in the pristine form of running Mercury. The pretended Salts and Sulphurs being so far from being Elementary parts extracted out of the Bodie of Mercurie, that they are rather (to borrow a terme of the Grammarians) De-compound Bodies, made up of the whole Metal and the Menstruum, or other Additaments imploy'd to disguise it. And as for Silver, I never could see any degree of Fire make it part with any of its three Principles. And though the Experiment lately mentioned from Claveus may beget a Suspition that Silver may be dissipated by Fire, provided it be extreamly violent and very lasting: yet it will not necessarily follow, that because the Fire was able at length to make the Silver lose a little of its weight, it was therefore able to dissipate it into its Principles. For first I might alledge that I have observ'd little Grains of Silver to lie hid in the small Cavities (perhaps glas'd over by a vitrifying heat) in Crucibles, wherein Silver has been long kept in Fusion, Page 59whence some Goldsmiths of my Acquaintance make a Benefit by grinding such Crucibles to powder, to recover out of them the latent particles of Silver. And hence I might argue, that perhaps Claveus was mistaken, and imagin'd that Silver to have been driven away by the Fire, that indeed lay in minute parts hid in his Crucible, in whose pores so small a quantity as he mist of so ponderous a Bodie might very well lie conceal'd. But Secondly, admitting that some parts of the Silver were driven away by the violence of the Fire, what proof is there that it was either the Salt, the Sulphur, or the Mercury of the Metal, and not rather a part of it homogeneous to what remain'd? For besides, that the Silver that was left see m'd not sensibly alter'd, which probably would have appear'd, had so much of any one of its Principles been separated from it: We finde in other Mineral Bodies of a less permanent nature than Silver, that the Fire may divide them into such minute parts, as to be able to carry them away with its self, without at all destroying their Nature. Thus we see that in the refining Image 41 (page 60)of Silver, the Lead that is mix'd with it (to carry away the Copper or other ignoble Mineral that embases the Silver) will, if it be let alone, in time evaporate away upon the Test; but if (as is most usual amongst those that refine great quantities of Metals together) the Lead be blown off from the Silver by Bellowes, that which would else have gone away in the Form of unheeded steams, will in great part be collected not far from the Silver, in the Form of a darkish Powder or Calx, which, because it is blown off from Silver, they call Litharge of Silver. Agricola de Natura Fossil. Lib. 9. Cap. 11. & 12. And thus Agricola in divers places informs us, when Copper, or the Oare of it is colliquated by the violence of the Fire with Cadmia, the Sparks that in great multitudes do fly upwards do, some of them, stick to the vaulted Roofs of the Furnaces, in the form of little and (for the most part) White Bubbles, which therefore the Greeks, and, in Imitation of them, our Drugsters call Pompholix: and others more heavy partly adhere to the sides of the Furnace, and partly (especially if the Covers be not kept upon the Pots) fall to the Ground, and by reason of their Ashy Page 61Colour as well as Weight were called by the same Greeks  in non-Latin alphabet 	, which, I need not tell you, in their Language signifies Ashes. I might add, that I have not found that from Venetian Talck (I say Venetian, because I have found other kinds of that Mineral more open) from the Lapis Ossifragus, (which the Shops call Ostiocolla) from Muscovia Glass, from pure and Fusible Sand, to mention now no other Concretes; those of my Acquaintance that have try'd have been able by the Fire to separate any one of the Hypostatical Principles, which you will the less scruple to believe, if you consider that Glass may be made by the bare Colliquation of the Salt and Earth remaining in the Ashes of a burnt Plant, and that yet common Glass, once made, does so far resist the violence of the Fire, that most Chymists think it a Body more undestroyable then Gold it self. For if the Artificer can so firmly unite such comparative gross Particles as those of Earth and Salt that make up common Ashes, into a Body indissoluble by Fire; why may not Nature associate in divers Bodies the more minute Elementary Corpuscles she has at hand too firmly to Image 42 (page 62)let them be separable by the Fire? And on this Occasion, Eleutherius, give me leave to mention to you two or three sleight Experiments, which will, I hope, be found more pertinent to our present Discourse, than at first perhaps they will appear. The first is, that, having (for Tryals sake) put a quantity of that Fugitive Concrete, Camphire, into a Glass Vessel, and plac'd it in a gentle Heat, I found it (not leaving behinde, according to my Estimate, not so much as one Grain) to sublime to the Top of the Vessel into Flowers: which in Whiteness, Smell, &c. seem'd not to differ from the Camphire it self. Another Experiment is that of Helmont, who in several places affirms, That a Coal kept in a Glass exactly clos'd will never be calcin'd to Ashes, though kept never so long in a strong Fire. To countenance which I shall tell you this Tryal of my own, That having sometimes distilled some Woods, as particularly Box, whilst our Caput mortuum remain'd in the Retort, it continued black like Charcoal, though the Retort were Earthen, and kept redhot in a vehement Fire; but as soon as ever it was brought out of the candent Page 63Vessel into the open Air, the burning Coals did hastily degenerate or fall asunder, without the Assistance of any new Calcination, into pure white Ashes. And to these two I shall add but this obvious and known Observation, that common Sulphur (if it be pure and freed from its Vinager) being leasurely sublim'd in close Vessels, rises into dry Flowers, which may be presently melted into a Bodie of the same Nature with that which afforded them. Though if Brimstone be burnt in the open Air it gives, you know, a penetrating Fume, which being caught in a Glass-Bell condenses into that acid Liquor called Oyl of Sulphur per Campanam. The use I would make of these Experiments collated with what I lately told you out of Agricola is this, That even among the Bodies that are not fixt, there are divers of such a Texture, that it will be hard to make it appear, how the Fire, as Chymists are wont to imploy it, can resolve them into Elementary Substances. For some Bodies being of such a Texture that the Fire can drive them into the cooler and less hot part of the Vessels wherein they are included, and if need be, remove them from place Image 43 (page 64)to place to fly the greatest heat, more easily than it can divorce their Elements (especially without the Assistance of the Air) we see that our Chymists cannot Analyze them in close Vessels, and of other compound Bodies the open Fire can as little separate the Elements. For what can a naked Fire do to Analyze a mixt Bodie, if its component Principles be so minute, and so strictly united, that the Corpuscles of it need less heat to carry them up, than is requisite to divide them into their Principles. So that of some Bodies the Fire cannot in close Vessels make any Analysis at all, and others will in the open Air fly away in the Forms of Flowers or Liquors, before the Heat can prove able to divide them into their Principles. And this may hold, whether the various similar parts of a Concrete be combin'd by Nature or by Art; For in factitious Sal Armoniack we finde the common and the Urinous Salts so well mingled, that both in the open Fire, and in subliming Vessels they rise together as one Salt, which seems in such Vessels irresoluble by Fire alone. For I can shew you Sal Armoniack which after the ninth Sublimation does still retain its Page 65compounded Nature. And indeed I scarce know any one Mineral, from which by Fire alone Chymists are wont to sever any Substance simple enough to deserve the name of an Element or Principle. For though out of native Cinnaber they distill Quicksilver, and though from many of those Stones that the Ancients called Pyrites they sublime Brimstone, yet both that Quicksilver and this Sulphur being very often the same with the common Minerals that are sold in the Shops under those names, are themselves too much compounded Bodies to pass for the Elements of such. And thus much, Eleutherius, for the Second Argument that belongs to my First Consideration; the others I shall the lesse insist on, because I have dwelt so long upon this. Proceed we then in the next place to consider, That there are divers Separations to be made by other means, which either cannot at all, or else cannot so well be made by the Fire alone. When Gold and Silver are melted into one Mass, it would lay a great Obligation upon Refiners and Goldsmiths to teach them the Art of separating them Image 44 (page 66)by the Fire, without the trouble and charge they are fain to be at to sever them. Whereas they may be very easily parted by the Affusion of Spirit of Nitte or Aqua fortis (which the French therefore call Eau de Depart:) so likewise the Metalline part of Vitriol will not be so easily and conveniently separated from the Saline part even by a violent Fire, as by the Affusion of certain Alkalizate Salts in a liquid Form upon the Solution of Vitriol made in common water. For thereby the acid Salt of the Vitriol, leaving the Copper it had corroded to joyn with the added Salts, the Metalline part will be precipitated to the bottom almost like Mud. And that I may not give Instances only in De-compound Bodies, I will add a not useless one of another kinde. Not only Chymists have not been able (for ought is vulgarly known) by Fire alone to separate true Sulphur from Antimony; but though you may finde in their Books many plausible Processes of Extracting it, yet he that shall make as many fruitlesse Tryals as I have done to obtain it by, most of them will, I suppose, be easily perswaded, that the Productions of such Page 67Processes are Antimonial Sulphurs rather in Name than Nature. But though Antimony sublim'd by its self is reduc'd but to a volatile Powder, or Antimonial Flowers, of a compounded Nature like the Mineral that affords them: yet I remember that some years ago I sublim'd out of Antimony a Sulphur, and that in greater plenty then ever I saw obtain'd from that Mineral, by a Method which I shall therefore acquaint you with, because Chymists seem not to have taken notice of what Importance such Experiments may be in the Indagation of the Nature, and especially of the Number of the Elements. Having then purposely for Tryals sake digested eight Ounces of good and well powder'd Antimony with twelve Ounces of Oyl of Vitriol in a well stopt Glas-Vessel for about six or seven Weeks; and having caus'd the Mass (grown hard and brittle) to be distill'd in a Retort plac'd in Sand, with a strong Fire; we found the Antimony to be so opened, or alter'd by the Menstruum wherewith it had been digested, That whereas crude Antimony, forc'd up by the Fire, arises only in Flowers, our Antimony thus handled afforded us Image 45 (page 68)partly in the Receiver, and partly in the Neck and at the Top of the Retort, about an Ounce of Sulphur, yellow and brittle like common Brimstone, and of so Sulphureous a smell, that upon the unluting the Vessels it infected the Room with a scarce supportable stink. And this Sulphur, besides the Colour and Smell, had the perfect Inflamability of common Brimstone, and would immediately kindle (at the Flame of a Candle) and burn blew like it. And though it seem'd that the long digestion wherein our Antimony and Menstruum were detain'd, did conduce to the better unlocking of the Mineral, yet if you have not the leasure to make so long a Digestion, you may by incorporating with powder'd Antimony a convenient Quantity of Oyl of Vitriol, and committing them immediately to Distillation, obtain a little Sulphur like unto the common one, and more combustible than perhaps you will at first take notice of. For I have observ'd, that though (after its being first kindled) the Flame would sometimes go out too soon of its self, if the same Lump of Sulphur were held again to the Flame of a Candle, it would be Page 69rekindled and burn a pretty while, not only after the second, but after the third or fourth accension. You, to whom I think I shewed my way of discovering something of Sulphureous in Oyl of Vitriol, may perchance suspect, Eleutherius, either that this Substance was some Venereal Sulphur that lay hid in that Liquor, and was by this operation only reduc'd into a manifest Body; or else that it was a compound of the unctuous parts of the Antimony, Lib. 1. Observat. Cap. 6. and the Saline ones of the Vitriol, in regard that (as Gunther informs us) divers learned men would have Sulphur to be nothing but a mixture made in the Bowels of the Earth of Vitriolate Spirits and a certain combustible Substance. But the Quantity of Sulphur we obtain'd by Digestion was much too great to have been latent in the Oyl of Vitriol. And that Vitriolate Spirits are not necessary to the Constitution of such a Sulphur as ours, I could easily manifest, if I would acquaint you with the several wayes by which I have obtain'd, though not in such plenty, a Sulphur of Antimony, colour'd and combustible like common Brimstone. And though I am not now minded Image 46 (page 70)to discover them, yet I shall tell you, that to satisfie some Ingenious Men, that distill'd Vitriolate Spirits are not necessary to the obtaining of such a Sulphur as we have been considering, I did by the bare distillation of only Spirit of Nitre, from its weight of crude Antimony separate, in a short time, a yellow and very inflamable Sulphur, which, for ought I know, deserves as much the name of an Element, as any thing that Chymists are wont to separate from any Mineral by the Fire. I could perhaps tell you of other Operations upon Antimony, whereby That may be extracted from it, which cannot be forc'd out of it by the Fire; but I shall reserve them for a fitter Opportunity, and only annex at present this sleight, but not impertinent Experiment. That whereas I lately observed to you, that the Urinous and common Salts whereof Sal Armoniack consists, remain'd unsever'd by the Fire in many successive Sublimations, they may be easily separated, and partly without any Fire at all, by pouring upon the Concrete finely powder'd, a Solution of Salt of Tartar, or of the Salt of Wood-Ashes; for upon your diligently mixing Page 71of these you will finde your Nose invaded with a very strong smell of Urine, and perhaps too your Eyes forc'd to water, by the same subtle and piercing Body that produces the stink; both these effects proceeding from hence, that by the Alcalizate Salt, the Sea Salt that enter'd the composition of the Sal Armoniack is mortify'd and made more fixt, and thereby a divorce is made between it and the volatile Urinous Salt, which being at once set at liberty, and put into motion, begins presently to fly away, and to offend the Nostrils and Eyes it meets with by the way. And if the operation of these Salts be in convenient Glasses promoted by warmth, though but by that of a Bath, the ascending Steams may easily be caught and reduc'd into a penetrant Spirit, abounding with a Salt, which I have sometimes found to be separable in a Crystalline Form. I might add to these Instances, that whereas Sublimate, consisting, as you know, of Salts & Quicksilver combin'd and carried up together by Heat, may be Sublim'd, I know not how often, by a like degree of Fire, without suffering any divorce of the component Bodies, the Mercury may be easily Image 47 (page 72)sever'd from the adhering Salts, if the Sublimate be distill'd from Salt of Tartar, Quick Lime, or such Alcalizate Bodies. But I will rather observe to you, Eleutherius, what divers ingenious men have thought somewhat strange; that by such an Additament that seems but only to promote the Separation, there may be easily obtain'd from a Concrete (that by the Fire alone is easily divisible into all the Elements that Vegetables are suppos'd to consist of) such a similar Substance as differs in many respects from them all, and consequently has by many of the most Intelligent Chymists been denied to be contain'd in the mixt Body. For I know a way, and have practis'd it, whereby common Tartat, without the addition of any thing that is not perfectly a Mineral except Saltpetre, may by one Distillation in an Earthen Retort be made to afford good store of real Salt, readily dissoluble in water, which I found to be neither acid, nor of the smell of Tartar, and to be almost as volatile as Spirit of Wine it self, and to be indeed of so differing a Nature from all that is wont to be separated by Fire from Tartar, that divers Page 73Learned Men, with whom I discours'd of it, could hardly be brought to beleeve, that so fugitive a Salt could be afforded by Tartar, till I assur'd it them upon my own Knowledge. And if I did not think you apt to suspect me to be rather too backward than too forward to credit or affirm unlikely things, I could convince you by what I have yet lying by me of that anomalous Salt. The Fourth thing that I shall alledge to countenance my first Consideration is, That the Fire even when it divides a Body into Substances of divers Consistences, does not most commonly analyze it into Hypostatical Principles, but only disposes its parts into new Textures, and thereby produces Concretes of a new indeed, but yet of a compound Nature. This Argument it will be requisite for me to prosecute so fully hereafter, that I hope you will then confess that 'tis not for want of good Proofs that I desire leave to suspend my Proofs till the Series of my Discourse shall make it more proper and seasonable to propose them. It may be further alledg'd on the behalf of my First Consideration, That some such distinct Substances may be obtain'd Image 48 (page 74)from some Concretes without Fire, as deserve no less the name of Elementary, than many that Chymists extort by the Violence of the Fire. We see that the Inflamable Spirit, or as the Chymists esteem it, the Sulphur of Wine, may not only be separated from it by the gentle heat of a Bath, but may be distill'd either by the help of the Sun-Beams, or even of a Dunghill, being indeed of so Fugitive a Nature, that it is not easy to keep it from flying away, even without the Application of external heat. I have likewise observ'd that a Vessel full of Urine being plac'd in a Dunghill, the Putrefaction is wont after some weeks so to open the Body, that the parts disbanding the Saline Spirit, will within no very long time, if the Vessel be not stopt, fly away of it self; Insomuch that from such Urine I have been able to distill little or nothing else than a nauseous Phlegme, instead of the active and piercing Salt and Spirit that it would have afforded, when first expos'd to the Fire, if the Vessel had been carefully stopt. And this leads me to consider in the Fifth place, That it will be very hard to Page 75prove, that there can no other Body or way be given which will as well as the Fire divide Concretes into several homogeneous Substances, which may consequently be call'd their Elements or Principles, as well as those separated or produc'd by the Fire. For since we have lately seen, that Nature can successefully employ other Instruments than the Fire to separate distinct Substances from mixt Bodies, how know we, but that Nature has made, or Art may make, some such Substance as may be a fit Instrument to Analyze mixt Bodies, or that some such Method may be found by Humane Industry or Luck, by whose means compound Bodies may be resolv'd into other Substances, than such as they are wont to be divided into by the Fire. And why the Products of such an Analysis may not as justly be call'd the component Principles of the Bodies that afford them, it will not be easy to shew, especially since I shall hereafter make it evident, that the Substances which Chymists are wont to call the Salts, and Sulphurs, and Mercuries of Bodies, are not so pure and Elementary as they presume, and as their Hypothesis requires. And this may Image 49 (page 76)therefore be the more freely press'd upon the Chymists, because neither the Paracelsians, nor the Helmontians can reject it without apparent Injury to their respective Masters. For Helmont do's more than once Inform his Readers, that both Paracelsus and Himself were Possessors of the famous Liquor, Alkahest, which for its great power in resolving Bodies irresoluble by Vulgar Fires, he somewhere seems to call Ignis Gehennae. To this Liquor he ascribes, (and that in great part upon his own Experience) such wonders, that if we suppose them all true, I am so much the more a Friend to Knowledge than to Wealth, that I should think the Alkahest a nobler and more desireable Secret than the Philosophers Stone it self. Of this Universal Dissolvent he relates, That having digested with it for a competent time a piece of Oaken Charcoal, it was thereby reduc'd into a couple of new and distinct Liquors, discriminated from each other by their Colour and Situation, and that the whole body of the Coal was reduc'd into those Liquors, both of them separable from his Immortal Menstruum, which remain'd as fit for such Operations Page 77as before. And he moreover tells us in divers places of his Writings, that by this powerful, and unwearied Agent, he could dissolve Metals, Marchasites, Stones, Vegetable and Animal Bodies of what kinde soever, and even Glass it self (first reduc'd to powder,) and in a word, all kinds of mixt Bodies in the World into their several similar Substances, without any Residence or Caput mortuum. And lastly, we may gather this further from his Informations, That the homogeneous Substances obtainable from compound Bodies by his piercing Liquor, were oftentimes different enough both as to Number and as to Nature, from those into which the same Bodies are wont to be divided by common Fire. Of which I shall need in this place to mention no other proof, then that whereas we know that in our common Analysis of a mixt Body, there remains a terrestrial and very fixt Substance, oftentimes associated with a Salt as fixt; Our Author tells us, that by his way he could Distill over all Concretes without any Caput mortuum, and consequently could make those parts of the Concrete volatile, which in the Vulgar Analysis would have Image 50 (page 78)been fixt. So that if our Chymists will not reject the solemn and repeated. Testimony of a Person, who cannot but be acknowledg'd for one of the greatest Spagyrists that they can boast of, they must not deny that there is to be found in Nature another Agent able to Analyze compound Bodies less violently, and both more genuinely and more universally than the Fire. And for my own part, though I cannot but say on this Occasion what (you know) our Friend Mr. Boyle is wont to say, when he is askt his Opinion of any strange Experiment; That He that hath seen it hath more Reason to beleeve it, than He that hath not; yet I have found Helmont so faithful a Writer, even in divers of his improbable Experiments (I alwayes except that Extravagant Treatise De Magnetica Vulnerum Curatione, which some of his Friends affirm to have been first publish'd by his Enemies) that I think it somewhat harsh to give him the Lye, especially to what he delivers upon his own proper Tryal. And I have heard from very credible Eyewitnesses some things, and seen some others my self, which argue so strongly, that a circulated Salt, or a Menstruum Page 79(such as it may be) may by being abstracted from compound Bodies, whether Mineral, Animal, or Vegetable, leave them more unlockt than a wary Naturalist would easily beleeve, that I dare not confidently measure the Power of Nature and Art by that of the Menstruums, and other Instruments that eminent Chymists themselves are as yet wont to Empoly about the Analyzing of Bodies; nor Deny that a Menstruum may at least from this or that particular Concrete obtain some apparently similar Substance, differing from any obtainable from the same Body by any degree or manner of Application of the Fire. And I am the more backward to deny peremptorily, that there may be such Openers of compound Bodies, because among the Experiments that make me speak thus warily, there wanted not some in which it appear'd not, that one of the Substances not separable by common Fires and Menstruums could retain any thing of the Salt by which the separation was made. And here, Eleutherius, (sayes Carneades) I should conclude as much of my Discourse as belongs to the first Consideration Image 51 (page 80)I propos'd, but that I foresee, that what I have delivered will appear liable to two such specious Objections, that I cannot safely proceed any further till I have examin'd them. And first, one sort of Opposers will be forward to tell me, That they do not pretend by Fire alone to separate out of all compound Bodies their Hypostatical Principles; it being sufficient that the Fire divides them into such, though afterwards they employ other Bodies to collect the similar parts of the Compound; as 'tis known, that though they make use of water to collect the Saline parts of Ashes from the Terrestrial wherewith they are blended, yet it is the Fire only that Incinerates Bodies, and reduces the fix'd part of them into the Salt and Earth, where of Ashes are made up. This Objection is not, I confess, inconsiderable, and I might in great part allow of it, without granting it to make against me, if I would content my self to answer, that it is not against those that make it that I have been disputing, but against those Vulgar Chymists, who themselves believe, and would fain make others do so, That the Fire is not only Page 81an universal, but an adaequate and sufficient Instrument to analyze mixt Bodies with. For as to their Practice of Extracting the fix'd Salt out of Ashes by the Affusion of Water, 'tis obvious to alleadge, that the Water does only assemble together the Salt the Fire had before divided from the Earth: as a Sieve does not further break the Corn, but only bring together into two distinct heaps the Flour and the Bran, whose Corpuscles before lay promiscuously blended together in the Meal. This I say I might alleadge, and thereby exempt my self from the need of taking any farther notice of the propos'd Objection. But not to lose the Rise it may afford me of Illustrating the matter under Consideration, I am content briefly to consider it, as far forth as my present Disquisition may be concern'd in it. Not to repeat then what has been already answer'd, I say farther, that though I am so civil an Adversary, that I will allow the Chymists, after the Fire has done all its work, the use of fair Water to make their Extractions with, in such cases wherein the Water does not cooperate with the Fire to make the Analysis; Image 52 (page 82)yet since I Grant this but upon Supposition that the Water does only wash off the Saline Particles, which the Fire Alone has Before Extricated in the Analyz'd Body, it will not be Reasonable, that this Concession should Extend to other Liquors that may Add to what they Dissolve, nor so much as to other Cases than those Newly Mentioned: Which Limitation I Desire You would be Pleas'd to Bear in Mind till I shall Anon have Occasion to make Use of it. And This being thus Premis'd, I shall Proceed to Observe, First, That Many of the Instances I Propos'd in the Preceding Discourse are Such, that the Objection we are Considering will not at all Reach Them. For Fire can no more with the Assistance of Water than without it Separate any of the Three Principles, either from Gold, Silver, Mercury, or some Others of the Concretes named Above. Hence We may Inferre, That Fire is not an Universal Analyzer of all Mixt Bodies, since of Metals and Minerals, wherein Chymists have most Exercis'd Themselves, there Appear scarce Any which they are able to Aanlyze by Fire, Page 83Nay, from which they can Unquestionably Separate so much as any One of their Hypostatical Principles; Which may well Appear no small Disparagement as well to their Hypothesis as to their Pretensions. It will also remain True, notwithstanding the Objection, That there may be Other Wayes than the wonted Analysis by Fire, to Separate from a Compound Body Substances as Homogeneneous as those that Chymists Scruple not to Reckon among their Tria Prima (as some of them, for Brevity Sake, call their Three Principles.) And it Appears, That by Convenient Additaments such Substances may be Separated by the Help of the Fire, as could not be so by the Fire alone: Witness the Sulphur of Antimony. And Lastly, I must Represent, That since it appears too that the Fire is but One of the Instruments that must be Employ'd in the Resolution of Bodies, We may Reasonably Challenge the Liberty of doing Two Things. For when ever any Menstruum or other Additament is Employ'd, together with the Fire to Obtain a Sulphur or a Salt from Image 53 (page 84)a Body, We may well take the Freedom to Examine, whether or no That Menstruum do barely Help to Separate the Principle Obtain'd by It, or whether there Intervene not a Coalition of the Parts of the Body Wrought upon with Those of the Menstruum, whereby the Produc'd Concrete may be Judg'd to Result from the Union of Both. And it will be farther Allowable for Us to Consider, how far any Substance, Separated by the Help of such Additaments, Ought to pass for one of the Tria Prima; since by One Way of Handling the same Mixt Body it may according to the Nature of the Additaments, and the Method of Working upon it, be made to Afford differing Substances from those Obtainable from it by other Additaments, and another Method, nay and (as may appear by what I Formerly told You about Tartar) Differing from any of the Substances into which a Concrete is Divisible by the Fire without Additaments, though perhaps those Additaments do not, as Ingredients, enter the Composition of the Obtained Body, but only Diversify the Operation of the Fire upon the Concrete; and though that Page 85Concrete by the Fire alone may be Divided into a Number of Differing Substances, as Great as any of the Chymists that I have met with teach us that of the Elements to be. And having said thus much (sayes Carneades) to the Objection likely to be Propos'd by some Chymists, I am now to Examine that which I Foresee will be Confidently press'd by Divers Peripateticks, who, to Prove Fire to be the true Analyzer of Bodies, will Plead, That it is the very Definition of Heat given by Aristotle, and Generally Received, Congregare Homogenea, & Heterogenea Segregare, to Assemble Things of a Resembling, and Disjoyn those of a Differing Nature. To this I answer, That this Effect is far from being so Essential to Heat, as 'tis Generally Imagin'd; for it rather Seems, that the True and Genuine Property of Heat is, to set a Moving, and thereby to Dissociate the parts of Bodies, and Subdivide them into Minute Particles, without regard to their being Homogeneous or Heterogeneous, as is apparent in the Boyling of Water, the Distillation of Quicksilver, or the Exposing of Bodies to the action of the Fire, whose Parts Image 54 (page 86)either Are not (at least in that Degree of Heat Appear not) Dissmilar, where all that the Fire can do, is to Divide the Body into very Minute Parts which are of the same Nature with one another, and with their Totum, as their Reduction by Condensation Evinces. And even when the Fire seems most so Congregare Homogenea, & Segregare Heterogenea, it Produces that Effect but by Accident; For the Fire does but Dissolve the Cement, or rather Shatter the Frame, or [tructure that kept the Heterogeneous Parts of Bodies together, under one Common Form; upon which Dissolution the Component Particles of the Mixt, being Freed and set at Liberty, do Naturally, and oftentimes without any Operation of the Fire, Associate themselves each with its Like, or rather do take those places which their Several Degrees of Gravity and Levity, Fixedness or Volatility (either Natural, or Adventitious from the Impression of the Fire) Assigne them. Thus in the Distillation (for Instance) of Man's Blood, the Fire do's First begin to Dissolve the Nexus or Cement of the Body; and then the Water, being the most Page 87Volatile, and Easy to be Extracted, is either by the Igneous Atomes, or the Agitation they are put into by the Fire, first carried up, till Forsaken by what carried it up, its Weight sinks it down into the Receiver: but all this while the other Principles of the Concrete Remain Unsever'd, and Require a stronger Degree of Heat to make a Separation of its more Fixt Elements; and therefore the Fire must be Increas'd which Carries over the Volatile Salt and the Spirit, they being, though Beleev'd to be Differing Principles, and though Really of Different Consistency, yet of an almost Equal Volatility. After them, as less Fugitive, comes over the Oyl, and leaves behinde the Earth and the Alcali, which being of an Equal Fixednesse, the Fire Severs them not, for all the Definition of the Schools. And if into a Red-hot Earthen or Iron Retort you cast the Matter to be Distill'd, You may Observe, as I have often done, that the Predominant Fire will Carry up all the Volatile Elements Confusedly in one Fume, which will afterwards take their Places in the Receiver, either according to the Degree of their Gravity, or according Image 55 (page 88)to the Exigency of their respective Textures; the Salt Adhering, for the most part, to the Sides and Top, and the Phlegme Fastening it self there too in great Drops, the Oyle and Spirit placing themselves Under, or Above one another, according as their Ponderousness makes them Swim or Sink. For 'tis Observable, that though Oyl or Liquid Sulphur be one of the Elements Separated by this Fiery Analysis, yet the Heat which Accidentally Unites the Particles of the other Volatile Principles, has not alwayes the same Operation on this, there being divers Bodies which Yield Two Oyls, whereof the One sinks to the Bottom of that Spirit on which the other Swims; as I can shew You in some Oyls of the same Deers Blood, which are yet by Me: Nay I can shew you Two Oyls carefully made of the same Parcel of Humane Blood, which not only Differ extreamly in Colour, but Swim upon one another without Mixture, and if by Agitation Confounded will of themselves Divorce again. And that the Fire doth oftentimes divide Bodies, upon the account that some Page 89of their Parts are more Fixt, and some more Volatile, how far soever either of these Two may be from a pure Elementary Nature, is Obvious enough, if Men would but heed it in the Burning of Wood, which the Fire Dissipates into Smoake and Ashes: For not only the latter of these is Confessedly made up of two such Differing Bodies as Earth and Salt; but the Former being condens'd into that Soot which adheres to our Chimneys, Discovers it self to Contain both Salt and Oyl, and Spirit and Earth, (and some Portion of Phlegme too) which being, all almost, Equally Volatile to that Degree of Fire which Forces them up, (the more Volatile Parts Helping perhaps, as well as the Urgency of the Fire, to carry up the more Fixt ones, as I have often Try'd in Dulcify'd Colcothar, Sublim'd by Sal Armoniack Blended with it) are carried Up together, but may afterwards be Separated by other Degrees of Fire, whose orderly Gradation allowes the Disparity of their Volatileness to Discover it self. Besides, if Differing Bodies United into one Mass be both sufficiently Fixt, the Fire finding no Parts Volatile Image 56 (page 90)enough to be Expell'd or carried up, makes no Separation at all; as may appear by a Mixture of Colliquated Silver and Gold, whose Component Metals may be easily Sever'd by Aqua Fortis, or Aqua Regis (according to the Predominancy of the Silver or the Gold) but in the Fire alone, though vehement, the Metals remain unsever'd, the Fire only dividing the Body into smaller Particles (whose Littlenesse may be argu'd from their Fluidity) in which either the little nimble Atoms of Fire, or its brisk and numberless strokes upon the Vessels, hinder Rest and Continuity, without any Sequestration of Elementary Principles. Moreover, the Fire sometimes does not Separate, so much as Unite, Bodies of a differing Nature; provided they be of an almost resembling Fixedness, and have in the Figure of their Parts an Aptness to Coalition, as we see in the making of many Plaisters, Oyntments, &c. And in such Metalline Mixtures as that made by Melting together two parts of clean Brass with one of pure Copper, of which some Ingenious Trades-men cast such curious Patterns (for Gold and Silver Works) Page 91as I have sometimes taken great Pleasure to Look upon. Sometimes the Bodies mingled by the Fire are Differing enough as to Fixidity and Volatility, and yet are so combin'd by the first Operation of the Fire, that it self does scarce afterwards Separate them, but only Pulverize them; whereof an Instance is afforded us by the Common Preparation of Mercurius Dulcis, where the Saline Particles of the Vitriol, Sea Salt, and sometimes Nitre, Employ'd to make the Sublimate, do so unite themselves with the Mercurial Particles made use of, first to Make Sublimate, and then to Dulcifie it, that the Saline and Metalline Parts arise together in many successive Sublimations, as if they all made but one Body. And sometimes too the Fire does not only not Sever the Differing Elements of a Body, but Combine them so firmly, that Nature her self does very seldom, if ever, make Unions less Dissoluble. For the Fire meeting with some Bodies exceedingly and almost equally Fixt, instead of making a Separation, makes an Union so strict, that it self, alone, is unable to Dissolve it; As we see, when an Alcalizate Image 57 (page 92)Salt and the Terrestrial Residue of the Ashes are Incorporated with pure Sand, and by Vitrification made one permanent Body, (I mean the course or greenish sort of Glass) that mocks the greatest Violence of the Fire, which though able to Marry the Ingredients of it, yet is not able to Divorce them. I can shew you some pieces of Glass which I saw flow down from an Earthen Crucible purposely Expos'd for a good while, with Silver in it, to a very vehement Fire. And some that deal much in the Fusion of Metals Informe me, that the melting of a great part of a Crucible into Glass is no great Wonder in their Furnaces. I remember, I have Observ'd too in the Melting of great Quantities of Iron out of the Oar, by the Help of store of Charcoal (for they Affirm that Sea-Coal will not yield a Flame strong enough) that by the prodigious Vehemence of the Fire, Excited by vast Bellows (made to play by great Wheels turn'd about by Water) part of the Materials Expos'd to it was, instead of being Analyz'd, Colliquated, and turn'd into a Dark, Solid and very Ponderous Glass, and that in such Quantity, Page 93that in some places I have seen the very High-wayes, neer such Iron-works, mended with Heaps of such Lumps of Glasse, instead of Stones and Gravel. And I have also Observ'd, that some kind of Fire-stone it self, having been employ'd in Furnaces wherein it was expos'd to very strong and lasting Fires, has had all its Fixt Parts so Wrought on by the Fire, as to be Perfectly Vitrifi'd, which I have try'd by Forcing from it Pretty large Pieces of Perfect and Transparent Glass. And lest You might think, Eleutherius, that the Question'd Definition of Heat may be Demonstrated, by the Definition which is wont to be given and Acquiesc'd in, of its contrary Quality, Cold, whose property is taught to be tam Homogenea, quam Heterogenea congregare; Give me leave to represent to You, that neither is this Definition unquestionable; for not to Mention the Exceptions, which a Logician, as such, may Take at it, I Consider that the Union of Heterogeneous Bodies which is Suppos'd to be the Genuine Production of Cold, is not Perform'd by every Degree of Cold. For we see for Instance that in the Urine of Image 58 (page 94)Healthy Men, when the Liquor has been Suffer'd a while to stand, the Cold makes a Separation of the Thinner Part from the Grosser, which Subsides to the Bottom, and Growes Opacous there; whereas if the Urinal be Warme, these Parts readily Mingle again, and the whole Liquor becomes Transparent as before. And when, by Glaciation, Wood, Straw, Dust, Water, &c. are Suppos'd to be United into one Lump of Ice, the Cold does not Cause any Real Union or Adunation, (if I may so Speak) of these Bodies, but only Hardening the Aqueous Parts of the Liquor into Ice, the other Bodies being Accidentally Present in that Liquor are frozen up in it, but not Really United. And accordingly if we Expose a Heap of Mony Consisting of Gold, Silver and Copper Coynes, or any other Bodies of Differing Natures, which are Destitute of Aqueous Moisture, Capable of Congelation, to never so intense a Cold, we find not that these Differing Bodies are at all thereby so much as Compacted, much less United together; and even in Liquors Themselves we find Phaenoment Page 95which Induce us to Question the Definition which we are examining. If Paracelsus his Authority were to be look't upon as a Sufficient Proof in matters of this Nature, I might here insist on that Process of his, whereby he Teaches that the Essence of Wine may be Sever'd from the Phlegme and Ignoble Part by the Assistance of Congelation: and because much Weight has been laid upon this Process, not only by Paracelsians, but other Writers, some of whom seem not to have perus'd it themselves, I shall give You the entire Passage in the Authors own Words, as I lately found them in the sixth Book of his Archidoxis, an Extract whereof I have yet about me; and it sounds thus. De Vino sciendum est, faecem phlegmaque ejus esse Mineram, & Vini substantiam esse corpus in quo conservatur Essentia, prout auri in auro latet Essentia. Juxta quod Practicam nobis ad Memoriam ponimus, ut non obliviscamur, ad hunc modum: Recipe Vinum vetustissimum & optimum quod habere poteris, calore saporeque ad placitum, hoc in vas vitreum infundas ut tertiam ejus partem impleat, & sigillo Hermetis occlusum Image 59 (page 96)in equino ventre mensibus quatuor, & in continuato calore teneatur qui non deficiat. Quo peracto, Hyeme cum frigus & gelu maxime saeviunt, his per mensem exponatur ut congeletur. Ad hunc modum frigus vini spiritum una cum ejus substantia protrudit in vini centrum, ac separat a phlegmate: Congelatum abjice, quod vero congelatum non est, id Spiritum cum substantia esse judicato. Hunc in Pelicanum positum in arenae digestione non adeo calida per aliquod tempus manere sinito; Postmodum eximito vini Magisterium, de quo locuti sumus. But I dare not Eleu. lay much Weight upon this Process, because I have found that if it were True, it would be but seldom Practicable in this Country upon the best Wine: for Though this present Winter hath been Extraordinary Cold, yet in very Keen Frosts accompanied with lasting Snowes, I have not been able in any Measure to Freeze a thin Vial full of Sack; and even with Snow and Salt I could Freeze little more then the Surface of it; and I suppose Eleu. that tis not every Degree of Cold that is Capable of Congealing Liquors, which is able to make such an Analysis Page 97(if I may so call it) of them by Separating their Aqueous and Spirituous Parts; for I have sometimes, though not often, frozen severally, Red-wine, Urine and Milk, but could not Observe the expected Separation. And the Dutch-Men that were forc'd to Winter in that Icie Region neer the Artick Circle, call'd Nova Zembla, although they relate, as we shall see below, that there was a Separation of Parts made in their frozen Beer about the middle of November, yet of the Freezing of their Back in December following they give but this Account: Yea and our Sack, which is so hot, was Frozen very hard, so that when we were every Man to have his part, we were forc'd to melt it in the Fire; which we shar'd every second Day, about half a Pinte for a Man, wherewith we were forc'd to sustain our selves. In which words they imply not, that their Back was divided by the Frost into differing Substances, after such manner as their Beer had been. All which notwithstanding, Eleu. suppose that it may be made to appear, that even Cold sometimes may Congregare Homogenea, & Heterogenea Segregare: and to Manifest this I may tell you, that I did once, purposely, Image 60 (page 98)cause to be Decocted in fair Water a Plant abounding with Sulphureous and Spirituous Parts, and having expos'd the Decoction to a keen North-Wind in a very Frosty Night, I observ'd, that the more Aqueous Parts of it were turn'd by the next Morning into Ice, towards the innermost part of which, the more Agile and Spirituous parts, as I then conjectur'd, having Retreated, to shun as much as might be their Environing Enemy, they had there preserv'd themselves unfrozen in the Form of a high colour'd Liquor, the Aqueous and Spirituous parts having been so sleightly (Blended rather than) United in the Decoction, that they were easily Separable by such a Degree of Cold as would not have been able to have Divorc'd the Parts of Urine or Wine, which by Fermentation or Digestion are wont, as Tryal has inform'd me, to be more intimately associated each with other. But I have already intimated, Eleutherius, that I shall not Insist on this Experiment, not only because, having made it but once I may possibly have been mistaken in it; but also (and that principally) because of that much more full and eminent Page 99Experiment of the Separative Virtue of extream Cold, that was made, against their Wills, by the foremention'd Dutch men that Winter'd in Nova Zembla; the Relation of whose Voyage being a very scarce Book, it will not be amiss to give you that Memorable part of it which concerns our present Theme, as I caus'd the Passage to be extracted out of the Englished Voyage it self. Gerard de Veer, John Cornelyson and Others, sent out of Amsterdam, Anno Dom. 1596. being forc'd by unseasonable Weather to Winter in Nova Zembla, neer Ice-Haven; on the thirteenth of October, Three of us (sayes the Relation) went aboard the Ship, and laded a Sled with Beer; but when we had laden it, thinking to go to our House with it, suddenly there arose such a Winde, and so great a Storm and Cold, that we were forc'd to go into the Ship again, because we were not able to stay without; and we could not get the Beer into the Ship again, but were forc'd to let it stand without upon the Sled: the Fourteenth, as we came out of the Ship, we found the Barrel of Beer Image 61 (page 100)standing upon the Sled, but it was fast frozen at the Heads; yet by reason of the great Cold, the Beer that purg'd out froze as hard upon the Side of the Barrel, as if it had been glu'd thereon: and in that sort we drew it to our House, and set the Barrel an end, and drank it up; but first we were forc'd to melt the Beer, for there was scarce any unfrozen Beer in the barrel; but in that thick Yiest that was unfrozen day the Strength of the Beer, so that it was too strong to drink alone, and that which was frozen tasted like Water; and being melted we Mix'd one with the other, and so drank it; but it had neither Strength nor Taste. And on this Occasion I remember, that having the last very Sharp Winter purposely try'd to Freeze, among other Liquors, some Beer moderately strong, in Glass Vessels, with Snow and Salt, I observ'd, that there came out of the Neck a certain thick Substance, which, it seems, was much better able then the rest of the Liquor (that I found turn'd into Ice) to resist a Frost, and which, by its Colour and consistence seem'd mafestly Page 101enough to be Yiest, whereat, I confess, I somewhat marvail'd, because I did not either discerne by the Taste, or find by Enquiry, that the Beer was at all too New to be very fit to be Drank. I might confirm the Dutchmens Relation, by what happen'd a while since to a neere Friend of mine, who complained to me, that having Brew'd some Beer or Ale for his own drinking in Holland (where he then dwelt) the Keenness of the late bitter Winter froze the Drink so as to reduce it into Ice, and a small Proportion of a very Strong and Spirituous Liquor. But I must not entertain you any longer concerning Cold, not onely because you may think I have but lost my way into a Theme which does not directly belong to my present Undertaking; but because I have already enlarg'd my self too much upon the first Consideration I propos'd, though it appears so much a Paradox, that it seem'd to Require that I should say much to keep it from being thought a meere Extravagance; yet since I Undertook but to make the common Assumption Image 62 (page 102)of our Chymists and Aristotelians appear Questionable, I hope I have so Perform'd that Task, that I may now Proceed to my Following Considerations, and Insist lesse on them than I have done on the First.   Page 103 THE SCEPTICAL CHYMIST. The Second Part. THe Second Consideration I Desire to have Notice Taken of, is This, That it is not so Sure, as Both Chymists and Aristotelians are wont to Think it, that every Seemingly Similar or Distinct Substance that is Separated from a Body by the Help of the Fire, was Pre-existent in it as a Principle or Element of it. That I may not make this Paradox a Greater then I needs must, I will First Briefly Explain what the Proposition means, before I proceed to Argue for it. And I suppose You will easily Believe Image 63 (page 104)That I do not mean that any thing is separable from a Body by Fire, that was not Materially pre-existent in it; for it Far Exceeds the power of Meerly Naturall Agents, and Consequently of the Fire, to produce anew, so Much as one Atome of Matter, which they can but Modifie and Alter, not Create; which is so Obvious a Truth, that almost all Sects of Philosophers have Deny'd the Power of producing Matter to Second Causes; and the Epicureans and some Others have Done the Like, in Reference to their Gods themselves. Nor does the Proposition peremptorily Deny but that some Things Obtain'd by the Fire from a Mixt Body, may have been more then barely Materially pre-existent in it, since there are Concretes, which before they be Expos'd to the Fire afford us several Documents of their abounding, some with Salt, and Others with Sulphur. For it will serve the present Turn, if it appear that diverse things Obtain'd from a Mixt Body expos'd to the Fire, were not its Ingredients Before: for if this be made to appear it, will be Rationall enough Page 105to suspect that Chymists may Decieve themselves, and Others, in concluding Resolutely and Universally, those Substances to be the Elementary Ingredients of Bodies barely separated by the Fire, of which it yet may be Doubted Whether there be such or No; at least till some other Argument then that drawn from the Analysis be Brought to resolve the Doubt. That then which I Mean by the Proposition I am Explaining, is, That it may without Absurdity be Doubted whether or no the Differing Substances Obtainable from a Concrete Dissipated by the Fire were so Exsistent in it in that Forme (at least as to their minute Parts) wherein we find them when the Analysis is over, that the Fire did only Dis joyne and Extricate the Corpuscles of one Principle from those of the other wherewith before they were Blended. Having thus Explain'd my Proposition, I shall endeavour to do two things, to prove it; The first of which is to shew that such Substances as Chymists call Principles May be produc'd De novo (as they speak.) And the other is to Image 64 (page 106)make it probable that by the Fire we may Actually obtain from some Mixt Bodies such Substances as were not in the Newly Expounded sence, pre-existent in them. To begin then with the First of these, I Consider that if it be as true as 'tis probable, that Compounded Bodies Differ from One Another but in the Various Textures Resulting from the Bigness, Shape, Motion, and contrivance of their smal parts. It will not be Irrationall to conceive that one and the same parcel of the Universal Matter may by Various Alterations and Contextures be brought to Deserve the Name, somtimes of a Sulphureous, and sometimes of a Terrene, or Aqueous Body. And this I could more largely Explicate, but that our Friend Mr. Boyle has promis'd us something about Qualities, wherein the Theme I now willingly Resign him, Will I Question not be Studiously Enquired into. Wherefore what I shall now advance in favour of what I have lately Deliver'd shall be Deduc'd from Experiments made Divers Years since. The first of which would have been much more Page 107considerable, but that by some intervening Accidents I was Necessitated to lose the best time of the year, for a trial of the Nature of that I design'd; it being about he middle of May before I was able to begin an Experiment which should have then been two moneths old; but such as it was, it will not perhaps be impertinent to Give You this Narrative of it. At the time newly Mention'd, I caus'd My Gardiner (being by Urgent Occasions Hinder'd from being present myself) to dig out a convenient quantity of good Earth, and dry it well in an Oven, to weigh it, to put it in an Earthen pot almost level with the Surface of the ground, and to set in it a selected seed he had before received from me, for that purpose, of Squash, which is an Indian kind of Pompion, that Growes apace; this seed I Ordered Him to Water only with Rain or Spring Water. I did not (when my Occasions permitted me to visit it) without delight behold how fast it Grew, though unseasonably sown; but the Hastning Winter Hinder'd it from attaining any thing neer its due and Wonted magnitude; (for I found Image 65 (page 108)the same Autumn, in my Garden, some of those plants, by Measure, as big about as my Middle) and made me order the having it taken Up; Which about the Middle of October was carefully Done by the same Gardiner, who a while after sent me this account of it; I have Weighed the Pompion with the Stalk and Leaves, all which Weighed three pound wanting a quarter; Then I took the Earth, baked it as formerly, and found it just as much as I did at First, which made me think I had not dry'd it Sufficiently: then I put it into the Oven twice More, after the Bread was Drawn, and Weighed it the Second time, but found it Shrink little or nothing. But to deal Candidly with You, Eleutherius, I must not conceal from You the Event of another Experiment of this Kind made this present Summer, wherein the Earth seems to have been much more Wasted; as may appear by the following account, Lately sent me by the same Gardiner, in these Words. To give You an Account of your Cucumbers, I have Gain'd two Indifferent Fair Ones, the Weight of them is ten Pound and a Halfe, the Branches with the Page 109Roots Weighed four Pounds wanting two Ounces; and when I had weighed them I took the Earth, and bak'd it in several small Earthen Dishes in an Oven; and when I had so done, I found the Earth wanted a Pound and a halfe of what it was formerly; yet I was not satisfi'd, doubting the Earth was not dry: I put it into an Oven the Second Time, (after the Bread was drawn) and after I had taken it out and weighed it, I found it to be the Same Weight: So I Suppose there was no Moisture left in the Earth. Neither do I think that the Pound and Halfe that was wanting was Drawn away by the Cucumber but a great Part of it in the Ordering was in Dust (and the like) wasted: (the Cucumbers are kept by themselves, lest You should send for them.) But yet in this Tryal, Eleutherius, it appears that though some of the Earth, or rather the dissoluble Salt harbour'd in it, were wasted, the main Body of the Plant consisted of Transmuted Water. And I might add, that a year after I caus'd the formerly mentioned Experiment, touching large Pompions, to be reiterated, with so good success, that if my memory does not much mis-inform me, it did not only much surpass any Image 66 (page 110)that I made before, but seem'd strangely to conclude what I am pleading for; though (by reason I have unhappily lost the particular Account my Gardiner writ me up of the Circumstances) I dare not insist upon them. The like Experiment may be as conveniently try'd with the seeds of any Plant, whose growth is hasty, and its size Bulky. If Tobacco will in These Cold Climates Grow well in Earth undung'd, it would not be amiss to make a Tryal with it; for 'tis an annual Plant, that arises where it prospers, sometimes as high as a Tall Man; and I have had leaves of it in my Garden neer a Foot and a Halfe broad. But the next time I Try this Experiment, it shall be with several seeds of the same sort, in the same pot of Earth, that so the event may be the more Conspicuous. But because every Body has not Conveniency of time and place for this Experiment neither, I made in my Chamber, some shorter and more Expeditions Tryals. I took a Top of Spearmint, about an Inch Long, and put it into a good Vial full of Spring water, so as the upper part of the Mint was above the neck of the Glass, and Page 111the lower part Immers'd in the Water; within a few Dayes this Mint began to shoot forth Roots into the Water, and to display its Leaves, and aspire upwards; and in a short time it had numerous Roots and Leaves, and these very strong and fragrant of the Odour of the Mint: but the Heat of my Chamber, as I suppose, kill'd the Plant when it was grown to have a pretty thick Stalk, which with the various and ramified Roots, which it shot into the Water as if it had been Earth, presented in its Transparent Flower-pot a Spectacle not unpleasant to behold. The like I try'd with sweet Marjoram, and I found the Experiment succeed also, though somewhat more slowly, with Balme and Peniroyal, to name now no other Plants. And one of these Vegetables, cherish'd only by Water, having obtain'd a competent Growth, I did, for Tryals sake, cause to be Distill'd in a small Retort, and thereby obtain'd some Phlegme, a little Empyrcumaticall Spirit, a small Quantity of adust Oyl, and a Caput mortuum; which appearing to be a Coal concluded it to consist of Salt and Earth: but Image 67 (page 112)the Quantity of it was so small that I forbore to Calcine it. The Water I us'd to nourish this Plant was not shifted nor renewed; and I chose Springwater rather than Rain-water, because the latter is more discernably a kinde of  in non-Latin alphabet 	, which, though it be granted to be freed from grosser Mixtures, seems yet to Contain in it, besides the Steams of several Bodies wandering in the Air, which may be suppos'd to impregnate it, a certain Spirituous Substance, which may be Extracted out of it, and is by some mistaken for the Spirit of the World Corporify'd, upon what Grounds, and with what Probability, I may elsewhere perchance, but must not now, Discourse to you. But perhaps I might have sav'd a great part of my Labour. For I finde that Helmont (an Author more considerable for his Experiments than many Learned men are pleas'd to think him) having had an Opportunity to prosecute an Experiment much of the same nature with those I have been now speaking of, for five Years together, obtain'd at the end of that time so notable a Quantity of Transmuted Water, Page 113that I should scarce Think it fit to have his Experiment, and Mine Mention'd together, were it not that the Length of Time Requisite to this may deterr the Curiosity of some, and exceed the leasure of Others; and partly, that so Paradoxical a Truth as that which these Experiments seem to hold forth, needs to be Confirm'd by more Witnesses then one, especially since the Extravagancies and Untruths to be met with in Helmonts Treatise of the Magnetick Cure of Wounds, have made his Testimonies suspected in his other Writings, though as to some of the Unlikely matters of Fact he delivers in them, I might safely undertake to be his Compurgator. But that Experiment of his which I was mentioning to You, he sayes, was this. He took 200 pound of Earth dry'd in an Oven, and having put it into an Earthen Vessel and moisten'd it with Raine water he planted in it the Trunk of a VVillow tree of five pound VVeight; this he VVater'd, as need required, with Rain or with Distill'd VVater; and to keep the Neighbouring Earth from getting into the Vessell, he employ'd a plate of Iron tinn'd over and perforated Image 68 (page 114)with many holes. Five years being efflux'd, he took out the Tree and weighed' it, and (with computing the leaves that fell during four Autumnes) he found it to weigh 169 pound, and about three Ounces. And Having again Dry'd the Earth it grew in, he found it want of its Former VVeight of 200 Pound, about a couple only of Ounces; so that 164 pound of the Roots, VVood, and Bark, which Constituted the Tree, seem to have Sprung from the VVater. And though it appears not that Helmont had the Curiosity to make any Analysis of this Plant, yet what I lately told You I did to One of the Vegetables I nourish'd with VVater only, will I suppose keep You from Doubting that if he had Distill'd this Tree, it would have afforded him the like Distinct Substances as another Vegetable of the same kind. I need not Subjoyne that I had it also in my thoughts to try how Experiments to the same purpose with those I related to You would succeed in other Bodies then Vegetables, because importunate Avocations having hitherto hinder'd me from putting my Design in Practise, I Page 115can yet speak but Confecturally of the Success: but the best is, that the Experiments already made and mention'd to you need not the Assistance of new Ones, to Verifie as much as my present task makes it concern me to prove by Experiments of this Nature. One would suspect (sayes Eleutherius after his long silence) by what You have been discoursing, that You are not far from Helmonts Opinion about the Origination of Compound Bodies, and perhaps too dislike not the Arguments which he imployes to prove it. VVhat Helmontian Opinion, and what Arguments do you mean (askes Carneades.) VVhat You have been Newly Discoursing (replies Eleutherius) tells us, that You cannot but know that this bold and Acute Spagyrist scruples not to Assert that all mixt Bodies spring from one Element; and that Vegetables, Animals, Marchasites, Stones, Metalls, &c. are Materially but simple VVater disguis'd into these Various Formes, by the plastick or Formative Virtue of their seeds. And as for his Reasons you may find divers of them scatter'd up and Image 69 (page 216)down his writings; the considerabl'st of which seem to be these three; The Ultimate Reduction of mixt Bodies into Insipid VVater, the Vicissitude of the supposed Elements, and the production of perfectly mixt Bodies out of simple VVater. And first he affirmes that the Sal circulatus Paracelsi, or his Liquor Alkahest, does adaequately resolve Plants, Animals, and Mineralls into one Liquor or more, according to their several internall Disparities of Parts (without Caput Mortuum, or the Destruction of their seminal Virtues;) and that the Alkahest being abstracted from these Liquors in the same weight and Virtue wherewith it Dissolv'd them, the Liquors may by frequent Cohobations from chalke or some other idoneous matter, be Totally depriv'd of their feminal Endowments, and return at last to their first matter, Insipid VVater; some other wayes he proposes here and there, to divest some particular Bodies of their borrow'd shapes, and make them remigrate to their first Simplicity. The second Topick whence Helmont drawes his Arguments, to prove VVater to be the Material cause of Mixt Bodies, I told Page 117You was this, that the other suppos'd Elements may be transmuted into one another. But the Experiments by him here and there produc'd on this Occasion, are so uneasie to be made and to be judg'd of, that I shall not insist on them; not to mention, that if they were granted to be true, his Inference from them is somewhat disputable; and therefore I shall pass on to tell You, That as, in his First Argument, our Paradoxical Author endeavours to prove Water the Sole Element of Mixt Bodies, by their Ultimate Resolution, when by his Alkahest, or some other conquering Agent, the Seeds have been Destroy'd, which Disguis'd them, or when by time those seeds are Weari'd or Exantlated or unable to Act their Parts upon the Stage of the Universe any Longer: So in his Third Argument he Endeavours to evince the same Conclusion, by the constitution of Bodies which he asserts to be nothing but Water Subdu'd by Seminal Virtues. Of this he gives here and there in his Writings several Instances, as to Plants and Animals; but divers of them being Difficult either to be try'd or to be Understood, and others of them being Image 70 (page 118)not altogether Unobnoxious to Exceptions, I think you have singl'd out the Principal and less Questionable Experiment when you lately mention'd that of the Willow Tree. And having thus, Continues Eleutherius, to Answer your Question, given you a Summary Account of what I am Confident You know better then I do, I shall be very glad to receive Your Sence of it, if the giving it me will not too much Divert You from the Prosecution of your Discourse. That If (replies Carneades) was not needlesly annex'd: for thorowly to examine such an Hypothesis and such Arguments would require so many Considerations, and Consequently so much time, that I should not now have the Liesure to perfect such a Digression, and much less to finish my Principle Discourse. Yet thus much I shall tell You at present, that you need not fear my rejecting this Opinion for its Novelty; since, however the Helmontians may in complement to their Master pretend it to be a new Discovery, Yet though the Arguments be for the most part his, the Opinion it self is very Antient: For Diogenes Page 119Laertius and divers other Authors speak of Thales, as the first among the Graecians that made disquisitions upon nature. And of this Thales, I Remember, De Natura Deorum. Tully informes us, that he taught all things were at first made of Water. And it seems by Plutarch and Justin Martyr, that the Opinion was Ancienter then he: For they tell us that he us'd to defend his Tene tby the Testimony of Homer. And a Greek Author, (the Scholiast of Apollonius) upon these Words   in non-Latin alphabet 	 Argonaut. 4.   The Earth of Slime was made,  Affirms (out of Zeno) that the Chaos, whereof all things were made, was, according to Hesiod, Water; which, settling first, became Slime, and then condens'd into solid Earth. And the same Opinion about the Generation of Slime seems to have been entertain'd by Orpheus, Athenagoras. out of whom one of the Antients cites this Testimony,   in non-Latin alphabet 	   Of Water Slime was made.  Image 71 (page 120)It seems also by what is delivered in Strabo out of another Author, Universarumrerum primordia diversa esse, faciendi autem mundi initium aquam. Strabo. Geograp lib. 15. circa medium. concerning the Indians, That they likewise held that all things had differing Beginnings, but that of which the World was made, was Water. And the like Opinion has been by some of the Antients ascrib'd to the Phoenicians, from whom Thales himself is conceiv'd to have borrow'd it; as probably he Greeks did much of their Thelogie, and, as I am apt to think, of their Philosophy too; since the Devising of the Atomical Hypothesis commonly ascrib'd to Lucippus and his Disciple Democritus, is by Learned Men attributed to one Moschus a Phoenician. And possibly the Opinion is yet antienter than so; For 'tis known that the Phoenicians borrow'd most of their Learning from the Hebrews. And among those that acknowledge the Books of Moses, many have been inclin'd to think Water to have been the Primitive and Universal Matter, by perusing the Beginning of Genesis, where the Waters seem to be mention'd as the Material Cause, not only of Sublunary Compounded Bodies, but of all those that make up the Universe; whose Component Parts did orderly, as Page 121it were, emerge out of that vast Abysse, by the Operation of the Spirit of God, who is said to have been moving Himself as hatching Females do (as the Original  in non-Latin alphabet 	, Deuter. 32.11. Meracephet is said to Import, and as it seems to signifie in one of the two other places, Jerem. 23.9. wherein alone I have met with it in the Hebrew Bible) upon the Face of the Waters; which being, as may be suppos'd, Divinely Impregnated with the seeds of all things, were by that productive Incubation qualify'd to produce them. But you, I presume, Expect that I should Discourse of this Matter like a Naturalist, not a Philologer. Wherefore I shall add, to Countenance Helmont's Opinion, That whereas he gives not, that I remember, any Instance of any Mineral Body, nor scarce of any Animal, generated of Water, a French Chymist, Monsieur de Rochas, has presented his Readers an Experiment, which if it were punctually such as he has deliver'd it, is very Notable. He then, Discoursing of the Generation of things according to certain Chymical and Metaphorical Notions (which I confess are not to me Intelligible) sets down, among divers Speculations not Image 72 (page 122)pertinent to our Subject, the following Narrative, which I shall repeat to you the sence of in English, with as little variation from the Literal sence of the French words, as my memory will enable me. Having (sayes he) discern'd such great Wonders by the Natural Operation of Water, I would know what may be done with it by Art Imitating Nature. Wherefore I took Water which I well knew not to be compounded, nor to be mix'd with any other thing than that Spirit of Life (whereof he had spoken before;) and with a Heat Artificial, Continual and Proportionate, I prepar'd and dispos'd it by the above mention'd Graduations of Coagulation, Congelation, and Fixation, untill it was turn'd into Earth, which Earth produc'd Animals, Vegetables and Minerals. I tell not what Animals, Vegetables and Minerals, for that is reserv'd for another Occasion: but the Animals did Move of themselves, Eat, &c.  and by the true Anatomie I made of them, I found that they were compos'd of much Sulphur, little Mercury, and less Salt.  The Minerals began to grow and encrease by converting into their own Nature one part of the Earth thereunto dispos'd; they were solid and Page 123heavy. And by this truly Demonstrative Science, namely Chymistry, I found that they were compos'd of much Salt, little Sulphur, and less Mercury. But (sayes Carneades) I have some Suspitions concerning this strange Relation, which make me unwilling to Declare an Opinion of it, unless I were satisfied concerning divers Material Circumstances that our Author has left unmentioned; though as for the Generation of Living Creatures, both Vegetable and Sensitive, it needs not seem Incredible, since we finde that our common water (which indeed is often Impregnated with Variety of Seminal Principles and Rudiments) being long kept in a quiet place will putrifie and stink, and then perhaps too produce Moss and little Worms, or other Insects, according to the nature of the Seeds that were lurking in it. I must likewise desire you to take Notice, that as Helmont gives us no Instance of the Production of Minerals out of Water, so the main Argument that he employ's to prove that they and other Bodies may be resolv'd into water, is drawn from the Operations of his Alkahest, and consequently cannot Image 73 (page 124)be satisfactorily Examin'd by You and Me. Yet certainly (sayes Eleutherius) You cannot but have somewhat wonder'd as well as I, to observe how great a share of Water goes to the making up of Divers Bodies, whose Disguises promise nothing neere so much. The Distillation of Eeles, though it yielded me some Oyle, and Spirit, and Volatile Salt, besides the Caput mortuum, yet were all these so disproportionate to the Phlegm that came from them (and in which at first they boyl'd as in a Pot of Water) that they seem'd to have bin nothing but coagulated Phlegm, which does likewise strangely abound in Vipers, though they are esteem'd very hot in Operation, and will in a Convenient Aire survive some dayes the loss of their Heads and Hearts, so vigorous is their Vivacity. Mans Bloud it self as Spirituous, and as Elaborate a Liquor as 'tis reputed, does so abound in Phlegm, that, the other Day, Distilling some of it on purpose to try the Experiment (as I had formerly done in Deers Bloud) out of about seven Ounces and a half of pure Bloud we drew neere six Ounces of Phlegm, before any of the Page 125more operative Principles began to arise, and Invite us to change the Receiver. And to satisfie my self that some of these Animall Phlegms were void enough of Spirit to deserve that Name, I would not content my self to taste them only, but fruitlesly pour'd on them acid Liquors, to try if they contain'd any Volatile Salt or Spirit, which (had there been any there) would probably have discover'd it self by making an Ebullition with the affused Liquor. And now I mention Corrosive Spirits, I am minded to Informe you, That though they seem to be nothing else but Fluid Salts, yet they abound in Water, as you may Observe, if either you Entangle, and so Fix their Saline Part, by making them Corrode some idoneous Body, or else if you mortifie it with a contrary Salt; as I have very manifestly Observ'd in the making a Medecine somewhat like Helmont's Balsamus Samech, with Distill'd Vinager instead of Spirit of Wine, wherewith he prepares it: For you would scarce Beleeve (what I have lately Observ'd) that of that acid Spirit, the Salt of Tartar, from which it is Distill'd, will by mortifying and retaining Image 74 (page 126)the acid Salt turn into worthless Phlegm neere twenty times its weight, before it be so fully Impregnated as to rob no more Distill'd Vinager of its Salt. And though Spirit of Wine Exquisitely rectify'd seem of all Liquors to be the most free from Water, it being so Igneous that it will Flame all away without leaving the least Drop behinde it, yet even this Fiery Liquor is by Helmont not improbably affirm'd, in case what he relates be True, to be Materially Water, under a Sulphureous Disguise: For, according to him, in the making that excellent Medecine, Paracelsus his Balsamus Samech, (which is nothing but Sal Tartari dulcify'd by Distilling from it Spirit of Wine till the Salt be sufficiently glutted with its Sulphur, and suffer the Liquor to be drawn off, as strong as it was pour'd on) when the Salt of Tartar from which it is Distill'd hath retain'd, or depriv'd it of the Sulphureous parts of the Spirit of Wine, the rest, which is incomparably the greater part of the Liquor, will remigrate into Phlegm. I added that Clause [In case what he Relates be True] because I have not as yet sufficiently try'd it my Page 127self. But not only something of Experiment keeps me from thinking it, as many Chymists do, absurd, (though I have, as well as they, in vain try'd it with ordinary Salt of Tartar:) but besides that Helmont often Relates it, and draws Consequences from it; A Person noted for his Sobernesse and Skill in Spagyrical Preparations, having been askt by me, Whether the Experiment might not be made to succeed, if the Salt and Spirit were prepar'd according to a way suitable to my Principles, he affirm'd to me, that he had that way I propos'd made Helmont's Experiment succeed very well, without adding any thing to the Salt and Spirit. But our way is neither short nor Easie. I have indeed (sayes Carneades) sometimes wonder'd to see how much Phlegme may be obtain'd from Bodies by the Fire. But concerning that Phlegme I may anon have Occasion to note something, which I therefore shall not now anticipate. But to return to the Opinion of Thales, and of Helmont, I consider, that supposing the Alkahest could reduce all Bodies into water, yet whether that water, because insipid, must be Elementary, Image 75 (page 128)may not groundlesly be doubted; For I remember the Candid and Eloquent Petrus Laurembergius in his Notes upon Sala's Aphorismes affirmes, that he saw an insipid Menstruum that was a powerfull Dissolvent, and (if my Memory do not much mis-informe me) could dissolve Gold. And the water which may be Drawn from Quicksilver without Addition, though it be almost Tastless, You will I believe think of a differing Nature from simple Water, especially if you Digest in it Appropriated Mineralls. To which I shall add but this, that this Consideration may be further extended. For I see no Necessity to conceive that the Water mention'd in the Beginning of Genesis, as the Universal Matter, was simple and Elementary VVater; since though we should Suppose it to have been an Agitated Congeries or Heap consisting of a great Variety of Seminal Principles and Rudiments, and of other Corpuscles fit to be subdu'd and Fashion'd by them, it might yet be a Body Fluid like VVater, in case the Corpuscles it was made up of, were by their Creator made small enough, and put into such an Page 129actuall Motion as might make them Glide along one another. And as we now say, the Sea consists of VVater, notwithstanding the Saline, Terrestrial, and other Bodies mingl'd with it,) such a Liquor may well enough be called VVater, because that was the greatest of the known Bodies whereunto it was like; Though, that a Body may be Fluid enough to appear a Liquor, and yet contain Corpuscles of a very differing Nature, You will easily believe, if You but expose a good Quantity of Vitriol in a strong Vessel to a Competent Fire. For although it contains both Aqueous, Earthy, Saline, Sulphureous, and Metalline Corpuscles, yet the whole Mass will at first be Fluid like water, and boyle like a seething pot. I might easily (Continues Carneades) enlarge my self on such Considerations, if I were Now Oblig'd to give You my Judgment of the Thalesian, and Helmontian, Hypothesis. But Whether or no we conclude that all things were at first Generated of Water, I may Deduce from what I have try'd Concerning the Growth of Vegetables, nourish'd with water, all that I now propos'd to my Self Image 76 (page 130)or need at present to prove, namely that Salt, Spirit, Earth, and ev'n Oyl (though that be thought of all Bodies the most opposite to Water) may be produc'd out of Water; and consequently that a Chymical Principle as well as a Peripatetick Element, may (in some cases) be Generated anew, or obtain'd from such a parcel of Matter as was not endow'd with the form of such aprinciple or Element before. And having thus, Eleutherius, Evinc'd that 'tis possible that such Substances as those that Chymists are wont to call their Tria Prima, may be Generated, anew: I must next Endeavour to make it Probable, that the Operation of the Fire does Actually (sometimes) not only divide Compounded Bodies into smal Parts, but Compound those Parts after a new Manner; whence Consequently, for ought we Know, there may Emerge as well Saline and Sulphureous Substances, as Bodies of other Textures. And perhaps it will assist us in our Enquiry after the Effects of the Operations of the Fire upon other Bodies, to Consider a little, what it does to those Mixtures which being Productions of the Art of Man, We best know the Composition Page 131of. You may then be pleas'd to take Notice that though Sope is made up by the Sope-Boylers of Oyle or Grease, and Salt, and Water Diligently Incorporated together, yet if You expose the Mass they Constitute to a Graduall Fire in a Retort, You shall then indeed make a Separation, but not of the same Substances that were United into Sope, but of others of a Distant and yet not an Elementary Nature, and especially of an Oyle very sharp and Faetid, and of a very Differing Quality from that which was Employ'd to make the Sope: so if you Mingle in a due Proportion, Sal Armoniack with Quick-Lime, and Distill them by Degrees of Fire, You shall not Divide the Sal Armoniack from the Quick-Lime, though the one be a Volatile, and the other a Fix'd Substance, but that which will ascend will be a Spirit much more Fugitive, Penetrant, and stinking, then Sal Armoniack; and there will remain with the Quick-Lime all or very near all the Sea Salt that concurr'd to make up the Sal Armoniack; concerning which Sea Salt I shall, to satisfie You how well it was United to the Image 77 (page 132)Lime, informe You, that I have by making the Fire at length very Vehement, caus'd both the Ingredients to melt in the Retort it self into one Mass and such Masses are apt to Relent in the Moist Air. If it be here Objected, that these Instances are taken from factitious Concretes which are more Compounded then those which Nature produces; I shall reply, that besides that I have Mention'd them as much to Illustrate what I propos'd, as to prove it, it will be Difficult to Evince that Nature her self does not make Decompound Bodies, I mean mingle together such mixt Bodies as are already Compounded of Elementary, or rather of more simple ones. For Vitriol (for Instance) though I have sometimes taken it out of Minerall Earths, where Nature had without any assistance of Art prepar'd it to my Hand, is really, though Chymists are pleas'd to reckon it among Salts, a De-compounded Body Consisting (as I shall have occasion to declare anon) of a Terrestriall Substance, of a Metal, and also of at least one Saline Body, of a peculiar and not Elementary Nature. And we see also in Animals, that their Page 133blood may be compos'd of Divers very Differing Mixt Bodies, since we find it observ'd that divers Sea-Fowle tast rank of the Fish on which they ordinarily feed; and Hipocrates himself Observes, that a Child may be purg'd by the Milke of the Nurse, if she have taken Elaterium; which argues that the purging Corpuscles of the Medicament Concurr to make up the Milke of the Nurse; and that white Liquor is generally by Physitians suppos'd to be but blanch'd and alter'd Blood. And I remember I have observ'd, not farr from the Alps, that at a certain time of the Year the Butter of that Country was very Offensive to strangers, by reason of the rank tast of a certain Herb, whereon the Cows were then wont plentifully to feed. But (proceeds Carneades) to give you Instances of another kind, to shew that things may be obtain'd by the Fire from a Mixt Body that were not Pre-existent in it, let Me Remind You, that from many Vegetables there may without any Addition be Obtain'd Glass, a Body, which I presume You will not say was Pre-existent in it, but produc'd by the Fire. To which I shall Image 78 (page 134)add but this one Example more, namely that by a certain Artificial way of handling Quicksilver, You may without Addition separate from it at least a 5th. or 4th. part of a clear Liquor, which with an Ordinary Peripatetick would pass for VVater, and which a Vulgar Chymist would not scruple to call Phlegme, and which, for ought I have yet seen or heard, is not reducible into Mercury again, and Consequently is more then a Disguise of it. Now besides that divers Chymists will not allow Mercury to have any or at least any Considerable Quantity of either of the Ignoble Ingredients, Earth and VVater; Besides this, I say, the great Ponderousness of Quicksilver makes it very unlikely that it can have so much Water in it as may be thus obtain'd from it, since Mercury weighs 12 or 14 times as much as water of the same Bulk. Nay for a further Confirmation of this Argument, I will add this Strange Relation, that two Friends of mine, the one a Physitian, and the other a Mathematician, and both of them Persons of unsuspected Credit, have Solemnly assured me, that after many Tryals they made, to reduce Page 135Mercury into Water, in Order to a Philosophicall Work, upon Gold (which yet, by the way, I know prov'd Unsuccesfull) they did once by divers Cohobations reduce a pound of Quicksilver into almost a pound of Water, and this without the Addition of any other Substance, but only by pressing the Mercury by a Skillfully Manag'd Fire in purposely contriv'd Vessels. But of these Experiments our Friend (sayes Carneades, pointing at the Register of this Dialogue) will perhaps give You a more Particular Account then it is necessary for me to do: Since what I have now said may sufficiently evince, that the Fire may sometimes as well alter Bodies as divide them, and by it we may obtain from a Mixt Body what was not Pre-existent in it. And how are we sure that in no other Body what we call Phlegme is barely separated, not Produc'd by the Action of the Fire: Since so many other Mixt Bodies are of a much less Constant, and more alterable Nature, then Mercury, by many Tricks it is wont to put upon Chymists, and by the Experiments I told You of, about an hour Image 79 (page 136)since, Appears to be. But because I shall ere long have Occasion to resume into Consideration the Power of the Fire to produce new Concretes, I shall no longer insist on this Argument at present; only I must mind You, that if You will not dis-believe Helmonts Relations, You must confess that the Tria Prima are neither ingenerable nor incorruptible Substances; since by his Alkabest some of them may be produc'd of Bodies that were before of another Denomination; and by the same powerfull Menstruum all of them may be reduc'd into insipid Water. Here Carneades was about to pass on to his Third Consideration, when Eleutherius being desirous to hear what he could say to clear his second General Consideration from being repugnant to what he seem'd to think the true Theory of Mistion, prevented him by telling him, I somewhat wonder, Carneades, that You, who are in so many Points unsatisfied with the Peripatetick Opinion touching the Elements and Mixt Bodies, should also seem averse to that Notion touching the manner of Mistion, wherein the Chymists (though perhaps without Page 137knowing that they do so) agree with most of the Antient Philosophers that preceded Aristotle, and that for Reasons so considerable, that divers Modern Naturalists and Physitians, in other things unfavourable enough to the Spagyrists, do in this case side with them against the common Opinion of the Schools. If you should ask me (continues Eleutherius) what Reasons I mean? I should partly by the Writings of Sennertus and other learned Men, and partly by my own Thoughts, be supply'd with more, then 'twere at present proper for me to Insist largely on. And therefore I shall mention only, and that briefly, three or four. Of these, I shall take the First from the state of the Controversie it self, and the genuine Notion of Mistion, which though much intricated by the Schoolmen, I take in short to be this. Aristotle, at least as many of his Interpreters expound him, and as indeed he Teaches in some places, where he professedly Dissents from the Antients, declares Mistion to be such a mutual Penetration, and perfect Union of the mingl'd Elements, that there is no Portion of the mixt Body, how Minute soever, which does not Image 80 (page 140)contain All, and Every of the Four Elements, or in which, if you please, all the Elements are not. And I remember, that he reprehends the Mistion taught by the Ancients, as too sleight or gross, for this Reason, that Bodies mixt according to their Hypothesis, though they appear so to humane Eyes, would not appear such to the acute Eyes of a Lynx, whose perfecter Sight would discerne the Elements, if they were no otherwise mingled, than as his Predecessors would have it, to be but Blended, not United; whereas the Antients, though they did not all Agree about what kind of Bodies were Mixt, yet they did almost unanimously hold, that in a compounded Bodie, though the Miscibilia, whether Elements, Principles, or whatever they pleas'd to call them, were associated in such small Parts, and with so much Exactness, that there was no sensible Part of the Mass but seem'd to be of the same Nature with the rest, and with the whole; Yet as to the Atomes, or other Insensible Parcels of Matter, whereof each of the Miscibilia consisted, they retain'd each of them its own Nature, being but by Apposition or Juxta-Position united Page 141with the rest into one Bodie. So that although by virtue of this composition the mixt Body did perhaps obtain Divers new Qualities, yet still the Ingredients that Compounded it, retaining their own Nature, were by the Destruction of the Compositum separable from each other, the minute Parts disingag'd from those of a differing Nature, and associated with those of their own sort returning to be again, Fire, Earth, or Water, as they were before they chanc'd to be Ingredients of that Compositum. This may be explain'd (Continues Eleutherius,) by a piece of Cloath made of white and black threds interwoven, wherein though the whole piece appear neither white nor black, but of a resulting Colour, that is gray, yet each of the white and black threds that compose it, remains what it was before, as would appear if the threds were pull'd asunder, and sorted each Colour by it self. This (pursues Eleutherius) being, as I understand it, the State of the Controversie, and the Aristotelians after their Master Commonly Defining, that Mistion is Miscibilium alteratorum Unio, that seems to comport much Image 81 (page 140)better with the Opinion of the Chymists, then with that of their Adversaries, since according to that as the newly mention'd Example declares, there is but a Juxta-position of separable Corpuscles, retaining each its own Nature, whereas according to the Aristotelians, when what they are pleas'd to call a mixt Body results from the Concourse of the Elements, the Miscibilia cannot so properly be said to be Alter'd, as Destroy'd, since there is no Part in the mixt Body, how small soever, that can be call'd either Fir, or Air, or Water, or Earth. Nor indeed can I well understand, how Bodies can be mingl'd other wayes then as I have declar'd, or at least how they can be mingl'd, as our Peripateticks would have it. For whereas Aristotle tells us, that if a Drop of Wine be put into ten thousand Measures of Water, the Wine being Overpower'd by so Vast a Quantity of Water will be turn'd into it, he speaks to my Apprehension, very improbably; For though One should add to that Quantity of Water as many Drops of Wine as would a Thousand times exceed it all, Page 141yet by his Rule the whole Liquor should not be a Crama, a Mixture of Wine and Water, wherein the Wine would be Predominant, but VVater only; Since the Wine being added but by a Drop at a time would still Fall into nothing but VVater, and Consequently would be turn'd into it. And if this would hold in Metals too, 'twere a rare secret for Goldsmiths, and Refiners; For by melting a Mass of Gold, or Silver, and by but casting into it Lead or Antimony, Grain after Grain, they might at pleasure, within a reasonable Compass of time, turn what Quantity they desire, of the Ignoble into the Noble Metalls. And indeed since a Pint of wine, and a pint of water, amount to about a Quart of Liquor, it seems manifest to sense, that these Bodies doe not Totally Penetrate one another, as one would have it; but that each retains its own Dimensions; and Consequently, that they are by being Mingl'd only divided into minute Bodies, that do but touch one another with their Surfaces, as do the Grains, of VVheat, Rye, Barley, &c. in a heap of severall sorts of Corn: And unless we say, that as Image 82 (page 144)when one measure of wheat, for Instance, is Blended with a hundred measures of Barley, there happens only a Juxta-position and Superficial Contact betwixt the Grains of wheat, and as many or thereabouts of the Grains of Barley. So when a Drop of wine is mingl'd with a great deal of water, there is but an Apposition of so many Vinous Corpuscles to a Correspondent Number of Aqueous ones; Unless I say this be said, I see not how that Absurdity will be avoyded, whereunto the Stoical Notion of mistion (namely by  in non-Latin alphabet 	, or Confusion) was Liable, according to which the least Body may be co-extended with the greatest: Since in a mixt Body wherein before the Elements were Mingl'd there was, for Instance, but one pound of water to ten thousand of Earth, yet according to them there must not be the least part of that Compound, that Consisted not as well of Earth, as water. But I insist, Perhaps, too long (sayes Eleutherius) upon the proofs afforded me by the Nature of Mistion: Wherefore I will but name Two or Three other Arguments; whereof the first shall be, Page 145that according to Aristotle himself, the motion of a mixt Body followes the Nature of the Predominant Element, as those wherein the Earth prevails, tend towards the Centre of heavy Bodies. And since many things make it Evident, that in divers Mixt Bodies the Elementary Qualities are as well Active, though not altogether so much so as in the Elements themselves, it seems not reasonable to deny the actual Existence of the Elements in those Bodies wherein they Operate. To which I shall add this Convincing Argument, that Experience manifests, and Aristotle Confesses it, that the Miscibilia may be again separated from a mixt Body, as is Obvious in the Chymical Resolutions of Plants and Animalls, which could not be unless they did actually retain their formes in it: For since, according to Aristotle, and I think according to truth, there is but one common Mass of all things, which he has been pleas'd to call Materia Prima; And since tis not therefore the Matter but the Forme that Constitutes and Discriminates Things, to say that the Elements remain not in a Mixt Body, Image 83 (page 144)according to their Formes, but according to their Matter, is not to say that they remain there at all; Since although those Portions of Matter were Earth and water, &c. before they concurr'd, yet the resulting Body being once Constituted, may as well be said to be simple as any of the Elements, the Matter being confessedly of the same Nature in all Bodies, and the Elementary Formes being according to this Hypothesis perish'd and abolish'd. And lastly, and if we will Consult Chymical Experiments, we shall find the Advantages of the Chymical Doctrine above the Peripatetick Title little less then Palpable. For in that Operation that Refiners call Quartation, which they employ to purifie Gold, although three parts of Silver be so exquisitely mingl'd by Fusion with a fourth Part of Gold (whence the Operation is Denominated) that the resulting Mass acquires severall new Qualities, by virtue of the Composition, and that there is scarce any sensible part of it that is not Compos'd of both the metalls; Yet if You cast this mixture into Aqua Fortis, the Silver will be dissolv'd in the Page 145Menstruum, and the Gold like a dark or black Powder will fall to the Bottom of it, and either Body may be again reduc'd into such a Metal as it was before, which shews: that it retain'd its Nature, notwithstanding its being mixt per Minima with the other: We likewise see, that though one part of pure Silver be mingled with eight or ten Parts, or more, of Lead, yet the Fire will upon the Cuppel easily and perfectly separate them again. And that which I would have you peculiarly Consider on this Occasion is, that not only in Chymicall Anatomies there is a Separation made of the Elementary Ingredients, but that some Mixt Bodies afford a very much greater Quantity of this or that Element or Principle than of another; as we see, that Turpentine and Amber yield much more Oyl and Sulphur than they do Water, whereas Wine, which is confess'd to be a perfectly mixt Bodie, yields but a little Inflamable Spirit, or Sulphur, and not much more Earth; but affords a vast proportion of Phlegm or water: which could not be, if as the Peripateticks suppose, every, even of the minutest Particles, were of the same Image 84 (page 146)nature with the whole, and consequently did contain both Earth and Water, and Aire, and Fire; Wherefore as to what Aristotle principally, and almost only Objects, that unless his Opinion be admitted, there would be no true and perfect Mistion, but onely Aggregates or Heaps of contiguous Corpuscles, which, though the Eye of Man cannot discerne, yet the Eye of a Lynx might perceive not to be of the same Nature with one another and with their Totum, as the Nature of Mistion requires, if he do not beg the Question, and make Mistion to consist in what other Naturalists deny to be requisite to it, yet He at least objects That as a great Inconvenience which I cannot take for such, till he have brought as Considerable Arguments as I have propos'd to prove the contrary, to evince that Nature makes other Mistions than such as I have allowed, wherein the Miscibilia are reduc'd into minute Parts, and United as farr as sense can discerne: which if You will not grant to be sufficient for a true Mistion, he must have the same Quarrel with Nature her self, as with his Adversaties. Page 147 Wherefore (Continues Eleutherius) I cannot but somewhat marvail that Carneades should oppose the Doctrine of the Chymist in a Particular, wherein they do as well agree with his old Mistress, Nature, as dissent from his old Adversary, Aristotle. I must not (replies Carneades) engage my self at present to examine thorowly the Controversies concerning Mistion: And if there were no third thing, but that I were reduc'd to embrace absolutely and unreservedly either the Opinion of Aristotle, or that of the Philosophers that went before him, I should look upon the latter, which the Chymists have adopted, as the more defensible Opinion: But because differing in the Opinions about the Elements from both Parties, I think I can take a middle Course, and Discourse to you of Mistion after a way that does neither perfectly agree, nor perfectly disagree with either, as I will not peremptorily define, whether there be not Cases wherein some Phaenomena of Mistion seem to favour the Opinion that the Chymists Patrons borrow'd of the Antients, I shall only endeavour to shew You that there Image 85 (page 148)are some cases which may keep the Doubt, which makes up my second General Consideration from being unreasonable. I shall then freely acknowledge to You (sayes Carneades) that I am not over-well satisfi'd with the Doctrine that is ascribed to Aristotle, concerning Mistion, especially fince it teaches that the four Elements may again be separated from the mixt Body; whereas if they continu'd not in it, it would not be so much a Separation as a Production. And I think the Ancient Philosophers that Preceded Aristotle, and Chymists who have since receiv'd the same Opinion, do speak of this matter more intelligibly, if not more probably, then the Peripateticks: but though they speak Congruously enough, to their believing, that there are a certain Number of Primogeneal Bodies, by whose Concourse all those we call Mixts are Generated, and which in the Destruction of mixt Bodies do barely part company, and recede from one another, just such as they were when they came together; yet I, who meet with very few Opinions that I can entirely Acquiesce in, Page 149must confess to You that I am inclin'd to differ not only from the Aristotelians, but from the old Philosophers and the Chymists, about the Nature of Mistion: And if You will give me leave, I shall Briefly propose to you my present Notion of it, provided you will look upon it, not so much as an Assertion as an Hypothesis; in talking of which I do not now pretend to propose and debate the whole Doctrine of Mistion, but to shew that 'tis not Improbable, that sometimes mingl'd substances may be so strictly united, that it doth not by the usuall Operations of the Fire, by which Chymists are wont to suppose themselves to have made the Analyses of mixt Bodies, sufficiently appear, that in such Bodies the Miscibilia that concurr'd to make them up do each of them retain its own peculiar Nature: and by the Spagyrists Fires may be more easily extricated and Recover'd, than Alter'd, either by a Change of Texture in the Parts of the same Ingredient, or by an Association with some parts of another Ingredient more strict than was that of the parts of this or that Miscibile among themselves. At these words Eleu. Image 86 (page 150)having press'd him to do what he propos'd, and promis'd to do what he desir'd; I consider then (resumes Carneades) that, not to mention those improper Kinds of mistion, wherein Homogeneous Bodies are Joyn'd, as when Water is mingl'd with water, or two Vessels full of the same kind of Wine with one another, the mistion I am now to Discourse of seems, Generally speaking, to be but an Union per Minima of any two or more Bodies of differing Denominations; as when Ashes and Sand are Colliquated into Glass or Antimony, and Iron into Regulus Martis, or Wine and Water are mingl'd, and Sugar is dissolv'd in the Mixture. Now in this general notion of Mistion it does not appear clearly comprehended, that the Miscibilia or Ingredients do in their small Parts so retain their Nature and remain distinct in the Compound, that they may thence by the Fire be again taken asunder: For though I deny not that in some Mistions of certain permanent Bodies this Recovery of the same Ingredients may be made, yet I am not convinc'd that it will hold in all or even in most, or that it is necessarily deducible from Chymicall Page 151Experiments, and the true Notion of Mistion. To explain this a little, I assume, that Bodies may be mingl'd, and that very durably, that are not Elementary or resolv'd into Elements or Principles that they may be mingl'd; as is evident in the Regulus of Colliquated Antimony, and Iron newly mention'd; and in Gold Coyne, which lasts so many ages; wherein generally the Gold is alloy'd by the mixture of a quantity, greater or lesser, (in our Mints they use about a 12th. part) of either silver, or Copper, or both. Next, I consider, that there being but one Universal matter of things, as 'tis known that the Aristotelians themselves acknowledge, who call it Materia Prima (about which nevertheless I like not all their Opinions,) the Portions of this matter seem to differ from One Another, but in certain Qualities or Accidents, fewer or more; upon whose Account the Corporeal Substance they belong to receives its Denomination, and is referr'd to this or that particular sort of Bodies; so that if it come to lose, or be depriv'd of those Qualities, though it ceases not to be a Body, yet it ceases Image 87 (page 152)from being that kind of Body as a Plant, or Animal, or Red, Green, Sweet, Sowre, or the like. I consider that it very often happens that the small parts of Bodies cohere together but by immediate Contact and Rest; and that however, there are few Bodies whose minute Parts stick so close together, to what cause soever their Combination be ascrib'd, but that it is possible to meet with some other Body, whose small Parts may get between them, and so dis-joyn them; or may be fitted to cohere more strongly with some of them, then those some do with the rest; or at least may be combin'd so closely with them, as that neither the Fire, nor the other usual Instruments of Chymical Anatomies will separate them. These things being premis'd, I will not peremptorily deny, but that there may be some Clusters of Particules, wherein the Particles are so minute, and the Coherence so strict, or both, that when Bodies of Differing Denominations, and consisting of such durable Clusters, happen to be mingl'd, though the Compound Body made up of them may be very Differing from either of Page 153the Ingredients, yet each of the little Masses or Clusters may so retain its own Nature, as to be again separable, such as it was before. As when Gold and Silver being melted together in a Due Proportion (for in every Proportion, the Refiners will tell You that the Experiment will not succeed) Aqua Fortis will dissolve the Silver, and leave the Gold untoucht; by which means, as you lately noted, both the Metalls may be recover'd from the mixed Mass. But (Continues Carneades) there are other Clusters wherein the Particles stick not so close together, but that they may meet with Corpuscles of another Denomination, which are dispos'd to be more closely United with some of them, then they were among themselves. And in such case, two thus combining Corpuscles losing that Shape, or Size, or Motion, or other Accident, upon whose Account they were endow'd with such a Determinate Quality or Nature, each of them really ceases to be a Corpuscle of the same Denomination it was before; and from the Coalition of these there may emerge a new Body, as really one, as either of the Corpuscles was before Image 88 (page 154)they were mingl'd, or, if you please, Confounded: Since this Concretion is really endow'd with its own Distinct qualities, and can no more by the Fire, or any other known way of Analysis, be divided again into the Corpuscles that at first concurr'd to make it, than either of them could by the same means be subdivided into other Particles. But (sayes Eleutherius) to make this more intelligible by particular examples; If you dissolve Copper in Aqua Fortis, or Spirit of Nitre, (for I remember not which I us'd, nor do I think it much Material) You may by Crystalizing the Solution Obtain a goodly Vitriol; which though by Virtue of the Composition it have manifestly diverse Qualities, not to be met with in either of the Ingredients, yet it seems that the Nitrous Spirits, or at least many of them, may in this Compounded Mass retain their former Nature; for having for tryal sake Distill'd this Vitrioll Spirit, there came over store of Red Fumes, which by that Colour, by their peculiar stinke, and by their Sourness, manifested themselves to be, Nitrous Spirits; and that the remaining Calx continu'd Copper, Page 155I suppose you'l easily beleeve. But if you dissolve Minium, which is but Lead Powder'd by the Fire, in good Spirit of Vinager, and Crystalize the Solution, you shall not only have a Saccharine Salt exceedingly differing from both its Ingredients; but the Union of some Parts of the Menstruum with some of those of the Metal is so strict, that the Spirit of Vinager seems to be, as such, destroy'd, since the Saline Corpuscles have quite lost that acidity, upon whose Account the Liquor was call'd Spirit of Vinager; nor can any such Acid Parts as were put to the Minium be Separated by any known way from the Saccharum Saturni resulting from them both; for not only there is no Sowrness at all, but an admirable Sweetness to be tasted in the Concretion; and not only I found not that Spirit of Wine, which otherwise will immediately hiss when mingl'd with strong Spirit of Vinager, would hiss being pour'd upon Saccharum Saturni, wherein yet the Acid Salt of Vinager, did it Survive, may seem to be concentrated; but upon the Distillation of Saccharum Saturni by its Self I found indeed a Liquor very Penetrant, Image 89 (page 156)but not at all Acid, and differing as well in smell and other Qualities, as in tast, from the Spirit of Vinager; which likewise seem'd to have left some of its Parts very firmly united to the Caput Mortuum, which though of a Leaden Nature was in smell, Colour, &c. differing from Minium; which brings into my mind, that though two Powders, the one Blew, and the other Yellow, may appear a Green mixture, without either of them losing its own Colour, as a good Microscope has sometimes inform'd me; yet having mingl'd Minium and Sal Armoniack in a requisite Proportion, and expos'd them in a Glass Vessel to the Fire, the whole Mass became White, and the Red Corpuscles were destroy'd; for though the Calcin'd Lead was separable from the Salt, yet you'l easily beleeve it did not part from it in the Forme of a Red Powder, such as was the Minium, when it was put to the Sal Armoniack, I leave it also to be consider'd, whether in Blood, and divers other Bodies, it be probable, that each of the Corpuscles that concurr to make a Compound Body doth, though some of them in Page 157some Cases may, retain its own Nature in it, so that Chymsts may Extricate each sort of them from all the others, wherewith it concurr'd to make a Body of one Denomination. I know there may be a Distinction betwixt Matter Immanent, when the material Parts remain and retain their own Nature in the things materiated, as some of the Schoolmen speak, (in which sence Wood, Stones and Lime are the matter of a House,) and Transient, which in the materiated thing is so alter'd, as to receive a new Forme, without being capable of re-admitting again the Old. In which sence the Friends of this Distinction say, that Chyle is the matter of Blood, and Blood that of a Humane Body, of all whose Parts 'tis presum'd to be the Aliment. I know also that it may be said, that of material Principles, some are common to all mixt Bodies, as Aristotles four Elements, or the Chymists Tria Prima; others Peculiar, which belong to this or that sort of Bodies; as Butter and a kind of whey may be said to be the Proper Principles of Cream: and I deny not, but that these Dissinctions may in some Cases Image 90 (page 158)be of Use; but partly by what I have said already, and partly by what I am to say, You may easily enough guess in what sence I admit them, and discerne that in such a sence they will either illustrate some of my Opinions, or at least will not overthrow any of them. To prosecute then what I was saying before, I will add to this purpose, That since the Major part of Chymists Credit, what those they call Philosophers affirme of their Stone, I may represent to them, that though when Common Gold and Lead are mingled Together, the Lead may be sever'd almost un-alter'd from the Gold; yet if instead of Gold a Tantillum of the Red Elixir be mingled with the Saturn, their Union will be so indissoluble in the perfect Gold that will be produc'd by it, that there is no known, nor perhaps no possible way of separating the diffus'd Elixir from the fixed Lead, but they both Constitute a most permanent Body, wherein the Saturne seems to have quite lost its Properties that made it be call'd Lead, and to have been rather transmuted by the Elixir, then barely associated to it. So that it seems not alwayes Page 159necessary, that the Bodies that are put together per minima, should each retain its own Nature; So as when the Mass it Self is dissipated by the Fire, to be more dispos'd to re-appear in its Pristine Forme, then in any new one, which by a stricter association of its Parts with those of some of the other Ingredients of the Compositum, then with one another, it may have acquired. And if it be objected, that unless the Hypothesis I oppose be admitted, in such Cases as I have proposed there would not be an Union but a Destruction of mingled Bodies, which seems all one as to say, that of such Bodies there is no mistion at all; I answer, that though the Substances that are mingl'd remain, only their Accidents are Destroy'd, and though we may with tollerable Congruity call them Miscibilia, because they are Distinct Bodies before they are put together, however afterwards they are so Confounded that I should rather call them Concretions, or Resulting Bodies, than mixt ones; and though, perhaps, some other and better Account may be propos'd, upon which the name Image 91 (page 160)of mistion may remain; yet if what I have said be thought Reason, I shall nor wrangle about Words, though I think it fitter to alter a Terme of Art, then reject a new Truth, because it suits not with it. If it be also Objected that this Notion of mine, concerning mixtion, though it may be allow'd, when Bodies already Compounded are put to be mingl'd, yet it is not applicable to those mixtions that are immediately made of the Elements, or Principles themselves; I Answer in the first place, that I here Consider the Nature of mixtion somewhat more Generally, then the Chymists, who yet cannot deny that there are oftentimes Mixtures, and those very durable ones, made of Bodies that are not Elementary. And in the next place, that though it may be probably pretended that in those Mixtures that are made immediately of the Bodies that are call'd Principles or Elements, the mingl'd Ingredients may better retain their own Nature in the Compounded Mass, and be more easily separated from thence; yet, besides that it may be doubted, whether there be any such Primary Bodies, I see not why the Page 161reason I alleadg'd, of the destructibility of the Ingredients of Bodies in General, may not sometimes be Applicable to Salt Sulphur or Mercury; 'till it be shewn upon what account we are to believe them Priviledged. And however, (if you please but to recall to mind, to what purpose I told you at First, I meant to speak of Mistion at this Time) you will perhaps allow that what I have hither to Discoursed about it may not only give some Light to the Nature of it in general (especially when I shall have an Opportunity to Declare to you my thoughts on that subject more fully) but may on some Occasions also be Serviceable to me in the Insuing Part of this Discourse. But, to look back Now to that part of our Discourse, whence this Excursion concerning Mistion has so long diverted us, though we there Deduc'd, from the differing Substances obtained from a Plant nourished only with Water, and from some other things, that it was not necessary that nature should alwaies compound a Body at first of all such differing bodies as the fire could afterwards make it afford; yet this is not all that may be collected from those Experiments. Image 92 (page 162)For from them there seems also Deducible something that Subverts an other Foundation of the Chymical Doctrine. For since that (as we have seen) out of fair Water alone, not only Spirit, but Oyle, and Salt, and Earth may be Produced; It will follow that Salt and Sulphur are not Primogeneal Bodies, and principles, since they are every Day made out of plain Water by the Texture which the Seed or Seminal principle of plants puts it into. And this would not perhaps seem so strange, if through pride, or negligence, We were not Wont to Overlook the Obvious and Familiar Workings of Nature; For if We consider what slight Qualities they are that serve to denominate one of the Tria Prima, We shall find that Nature do's frequently enough work as great Alterations in divers parcells of matter: For to be readily dissoluble in water, is enough to make the body that is so, passe for a Salt. And yet I see not why from a new shufling and Disposition of the Component Particles of a body, it should be much harder for Nature to compose a body dissoluble in Page 163Water, of a portion of Water that was not so before, then of the Liquid substance of an Egg, which will easily mix with VVater, to produce by the bare warmth of a hatching Hen, Membrans, Feathrs, Tendons, and other parts, that are not dissoluble in VVater as that Liquid Substance was: Nor is the Hardness and Brittleness of Salt more difficult for Nature to introduce into such a yielding body as VVater, then it is for her to make the Bones of a Chick out of the tender Substance of the Liquors of an Egg. But instead of prosecuting this consideration, as I easily might, I will proceed, as soon as I have taken notice of an objection that lies in my Way. For I easily foresee it will be alledged, that the above mentioned Examples are all taken from Plants, and Animals, in whom the Matter is Fashioned by the Plastick power of the seed, or something analogous thereunto. Whereas the Fire do's not act like any of the Seminal Principles, but destroyes them all, when they come within its Reach. But to this I shall need at present to make but this easy Answer, That whether it be a Seminal Principle, or any other which Image 93 (page 164)fashions that Matter after those various manners I have mentioned to You, yet 'tis Evident, that either by the Plastick principle Alone, or that and Heat Together, or by some Other cause capable to context the matter, it is yet possible that the matter may be Anew contriv'd into such Bodies. And 'tis only for the Possibility of this that I am now contending.   Page 165 THE SCEPTICAL CHYMIST. The Third Part. WHat I have hitherto Discours'd, Eleutherius, (sayes his Friend to Him) has, I presume, shew'n You, that a Considering Man may very well question the Truth of those very Suppositions which Chymists as well as Peripatericks, without proving, take for granted; and upon which Depends the Validity of the Inferences they draw from their Experiments. Wherefore having dispach't that, which though a Chymist Perhaps will not, yet I do, look upon as the most Important, as well as Difficult, part of my Task, it will now be Seasonable for me to proceed Image 94 (page 166)to the Consideration of the Experiments themselves, wherein they are wont so much to Triumph and Glory. And these will the rather deserve a serious Examination, because those that Alledge them are wont to do it with so much Confidence and Ostentation, that they have hitherto impos'd upon almost all Persons, without excepting Philosophers and Physitians themselves; who have read their Books, or heard them talk. For some learned Men have been content rather to beleeve what they so boldly Affirm, then be at the trouble and charge, to try whether or no it be True. Others again, who have Curiosity enough to Examine the Truth of what is Averr'd, want Skill and Opportunity to do what they Desire. And the Generality even of Learned Men, seeing the Chymists (not contenting themselves with the Schools to amuse the World with empty words) Actually Perform'd divers strange things, and, among those Resolve Compound Bodies into several Substances not known by former Philosophers to be contain'd in them: Men I say, seeing these Things, and Page 167Hearing with what Confidence Chymists Averr the Substances Obtain'd from Compound Bodies by the Fire to be the True Elements, or, (as they speak) Hypostaticall Principles of them, are forward to think it but Just as well as Modest, that according to the Logicians Rule, the Skilfull Artists should be Credited in their own Art; Especially when those things whose Nature they so Confidently take upon them to teach others are not only Productions of their own Skill, but such as others Know not else what to make of. But though (Continues Carneades) the Chymists have been able upon some or other of the mention'd Acounts, not only to Delight but Amaze, and almost to bewitch even Learned Men; yet such as You and I, who are not unpractis'd in the Trade, must not suffer our Selves to be impos'd upon by hard Names, or bold Assertions; nor to be dazl'd by that Light which should but assist us to discern things the more clearly. It is one thing to be able to help Nature to produce things, and another thing to Understand well the Nature Image 95 (page 168)of the things produc'd. As we see, that many Persons that can beget Children, are for all that as Ignorant of the Number and Nature of the parts, especially the internal ones, that Constitute a Childs? Body, as they that never were Parents. Nor do I Doubt, but you'l excuse me, if as I thank the Chymists for the things their Analysis shews me, so I take the Liberty to consider how many, and what they are, without being astonish'd at them; as if, whosoever hath Skill enough to shew men some new thing of his own making, had the Right to make them believe whatsoever he pleases to tell them concerning it. Wherefore I will now proceed to my Third General Consideration, which is, That it does not appear, that Three is precisely and Universally the Number of the Distinct Substances or Elements, whereinto mixt Bodies are resoluble by the Fire; I mean that 'tis not prov'd by Chymists, that all the Compound Bodies, which are granted to be perfectly mixt, are upon their Chymical Analysis divisible each of them into just Three Distinct Substances, neither Page 169more nor less, which are wont to be lookt upon as Elementary, or may as well be reputed so as those that are so reputed. Which last Clause I subjoyne, to prevent your Objecting, that some of the Substances I may have occasion to mention by and by, are not perfectly Homogeneous, nor Consequently worthy of the name of Principles. For that which I am now to consider, is, into how many Differing Substances, that may plausibly pass for the Elementary Ingredients of a mix'd Body, it may be Analyz'd by the Fire; but whether each of these be un-compounded, I reserve to examine, when I shall come to the next General Consideration; where I hope to evince, that the Substances which the Chymists not only allow, but assert to be the Component Principles of the Body resolv'd into them, are not wont to be uncompounded. Now there are two Kind of Arguments (pursues Carneades) which may be brought to make my Third Proposition seem probable; one sort of them being of a more Speculative Nature, and the other drawn from Experience. Image 96 (page 170)To begin then with the first of these. But as Carneades was going to do as he had said, Eleutherius interrupted him, by saying with a somewhat smiling countenance; If you have no mind I should think, that the Proverb, That Good Wits have bad Memories, is Rational and Applicable to You, You must not Forget now you are upon the Speculative Considerations, that may relate to the Number of the Elements; that your Self did not long since Deliver and Concede some Propositions in Favour of the Chymical Doctrine, which I may without disparagement to you think it uneasie, even for Carneades to answer. I have not, replies he, Forgot the Concessions you mean; but I hope too, that you have not forgot neither with what Cautions they were made, when I had not yet assumed the Person I am now sustaining. But however, I shall to content You, so discourse of my Third general consideration, as to let You see, That I am not Unmindful of the things you would have me remember. Page 171 To talk then again according to such principles as I then made use of, I shall represent, that if it be granted rational to suppose, as I then did, that the Elements consisted at first of certain small and primary Coalitions of the minute Particles of matter into Corpuscles very numerous, and very like each other, It will not be absurd to conceive, that such primary Clusters may be of far more sorts then three or five; and consequently, that we need not suppose, that in each of the compound Bodies we are treating of there should be found just three sorts of such primitive Coalitions, as we are speaking of. And if according to this Notion we allow a considerable number of differing Elements, I may add, that it seems very possible, that to the constitution of one sort of mixt Bodies two kinds of Elementary ones may suffice (as I lately Exemplify'd to you, in that most durable Concrete, Glass,) another sort of Mixts may be compos'd of three Elements, another of four, another of five, and another perhaps of many more. So that according to this Notion, there can be no determinate number assign'd, as Image 97 (page 172)that of the Elements, of all sorts of compound Bodies whatsoever, it being very probable that some Concretes consist of fewer, some of more Elements. Nay, it does not seem Impossible, according to these Principles, but that there may be two sorts of Mixts, whereof the one may not have any of all the same Elements as the other consists of; as we oftentimes see two words, whereof the one has not any one of the Letters to be met with in the other; or as we often meet with diverse Electuaries, in which no Ingredient (except Sugar) is common to any two of them. I will not here debate whether there may not be a multitude of these Corpuscles, which by reason of their being primary and simple, might be called Elementary, if several sorts of them should convene to compose any Body, which are as yet free, and neither as yet contex'd and entangl'd with primary Corpuscles of other kinds, but remains liable to be subdu'd and fashion'd by Seminal Principles, or the like powerful and Transmuting Agent, by whom they may be so connected among themselves, or with the parts of one of the bodies, as to make the compound Page 173Bodies, whose Ingredients they are, resoluble into more, or other Elements then those that Chymists have hitherto taken notice of. To all which I may add, that since it appears, by what I observ'd to you of the permanency of Gold and Silver, that even Corpuscles that are not of an Elementary but compounded Nature, may be of so durable a Texture, as to remain indissoluble in the ordinary Analysis that Chymists make of Bodies by the Fire; 'Tis not impossible but that, though there were but three Elements, yet there may be a greater number of Bodies, which the wonted wayes of Anatomy will not discover to be no Elementary Bodies. But, sayes Carneades, having thus far, in compliance to you, talk't conjecturally of the number of the Elements, 'tis now time to consider, not of how many Elements it is possible that Nature may compound mix'd Bodies, but (at least as farr as the ordinary Experiments of Chymists will informe us) of how many she doth make them up. I say then, that it does not by these sufficiently appear to me, that there is Image 98 (page 174)any one determinate number of Elements to be uniformly met with in all the several sorts of Bodies allow'd to be perfectly mixt. And for the more distinct proof of this Proposition, I shall in the first place Reprelent, That there are divers Bodies, which I could never see by fire divided into so many as three Elementary substances. I would fain (as I said lately to Philoponus) see that fixt and noble Metal we call Gold separated into Sait, Sulphur and Mercury: and if any man will submit to a comperent forfeiture in case of sailing, I shall willingly in case of prosperous successe pay both for the Materials and the charges of such an Experiment. 'Tis not, that after what I have try'd my self I dare peremptorily deny, that there may out of Gold be extracted a certain substance, which I cannot hinder Chymists from calling its Tincture or Sulphur; and which leaves the remaining Body depriv'd of its wonted colour. Nor an I sure, that there cannot be drawn out of the same Metal a real quick and running Mercury. But for the Salt of Gold, I never could either see it, or be satisfied that there was ever such a thing separated, Page 175in rerum natura, by the relation of any credible eye witnesse. And for the several Processes that Promise that effect, the materials that must be wrought upon are somewhat too pretious and costly to be wasted upon so groundlesse adventures, of which not only the successe is doubtful, but the very possibility is not yet demonstrated. Yet that which most deterres me from such tryalls, is not their chargeablenesse, but their unsatisfactorinesse, though they should succeed. For the Extraction of this golden Salt being in Chymists Processes prescribed to be effected by corrosive Menstruums, or the Intervention of other Saline Bodies, it will remain doubtful to a wary person, whether the Emergent Salt be that of the Gold it self; or of the Saline Bodies or Spirits employ'd to prepare it; For that such disguises of Metals do often impose upon Artists, I am sure Eleutherius is not so much a stranger to Chymistry as to ignore. I would likewise willingly see the three principles separated from the pure sort of Virgin-Sand, from Qsteocolla, from refined Silver, from Quicksilver, freed from its adventitious Sulphur, from Venetian Talk, Image 99 (page 176)which by long detention in an extreme Reverberium, I could but divide into smaller Particles, (not the constituent principles,) Nay, which, when I caused it to be kept, I know not how long, in a Glasse-house fire, came out in the Figure it's Lumps had when put in, though alter'd to an almost Amethystine colour; and from divers other Bodies, which it were now unnecessary to enumerate. For though I dare not absolutely affirme it to be impossible to Analyze these Bodies into their Tria Prima; yet because, neither my own Experiments, nor any competent Testimony hath hitherto either taught me how such an Analysis may be made, or satisfy'd me, that it hath been so, I must take the Liberty to refrain from believing it, till the Chymists prove it, or give us intelligible and practicable Processes to performe what they pretend. For whilst they affect that Aenigmatical obscurity with which they are wont to puzzle the Readers of their divulg'd Processes concerning the Analyticall Preparation of Gold or Mercury, they leave wary persons much unsatisfyed whether or no the differing Substances, they promise to produce, be truly Page 177the Hypostatical Principles, or only some intermixtures of the divided Bodies with those employ'd to work upon them, as is Evident in the seeming Crystalls of Silver, and those of Mercury; which though by some inconsiderately supposed to be the Salts of those Metalls, are plainly but mixtures of the Metalline Bodies, with the Saline parts of Aqua fortis or other corrosive Liquors; as is evident by their being reducible into Silver or Quicksilver, as they were before. I cannot but Confesse (saith Eleutherius) that though Chymists may upon probable grounds affirm themselves Able to obtain their Tria Prima, from Animals and Vegetables, yet I have often wondred that they should so confidently pretend also to resolve all Metalline and other Mineral bodies into Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury. For 'tis a saying almost Proverbial, among those Chymists themselves that are accounted Philosophers; and our famous Countryman Roger Bacon has particularly adopted it; that Facilius est aurum facere quam destruere. And I fear, with You, that Gold is not the only Mineral from which Chymists are wont fruitlessly to attempt the Image 100 (page 178)separating of their three Principles. I know indeed (continues Eleutherius) that the Learned Sennertus, even in that book where he takes not upon him to play the Advocate for the Chymists, but the Umpier betwixt them and the Peripateticks, expresses himself roundly, thus; Salem omnibus inesse (mixtis scilicet) & ex iis fieri posse omnibus in resolutionibus Chymicis versatis notissimum est. Sennert. lib. de cons. & dissens. pag. 147. And in the next Page, Quod de sale dixi, saies he, Idem de Sulphure dici potest: but by his favour I must see very good proofs, before I believe such general Assertions, how boldly soever made; and he that would convince me of their truth, must first teach me some true and practicable way of separating Salt and Sulphur from Gold, Silver, and those many different sort of Stones, that a violent Fire does not bring to Lime, but to Fusion; and not only I, for my own part, never saw any of those newly nam'd Bodies so resolved; but Helmont, who was much better vers'd in the Chymical Anatomizing of Bodies then either Sennertus or I, has somewhere this resolute passage; Scio (saies he) ex arena, Helmon. pag. 409. silicibus & saxis, non Calcariis, nunquam Sulphur aut Mercurium Page 179trahi posse; Nay Quercetanus himself, though the grand stickler for the Tria Prima, has this Confession of the Irresolubleness of Diamonds; Quercet. apud Billich in Thessalo redivivo. pag. 99. Adamas (saith he) omnium factus Lapidum solidissimus ac durissimus ex arctissima videlicet triunt principiorum unione ac Cohaerentia, quae nulla arte separationis in solutionem principiorum suorum spiritualium disjungi potest. And indeed, pursues Eleutherius, I was not only glad, but somewhat surprized to find you inclined to Admit that there may be a Sulphur and a running Mercury drawn from Gold; for unlesse you do (as your expression seem'd to intimate) take the word Sulphur in a very loose sence, I must doubt whether our Chymists can separate a Sulphur from Gold: For when I saw you make the experiment that I suppose invited you to speak as you did, I did not judge the golden Tincture to be the true principle of Sulphur extracted from the body, but an aggregate of some such highly colour'd parts of the Gold, as a Chymist would have called a Sulphur incombustible, which in plain English seems to be little better man to call it a Sulphur and no Sulphur. And as for Metalline Mercuries, I had Image 101 (page 180)not wondred at it, though you had expressed much more severity in speaking of them: For I remember that having once met an old and famous Artist, who had long been (and still is) Chymist to a great Monarch, the repute he had of a very honest man invited me to desire him to tell me ingenuously whether or no, among his many labours, he had ever really extracted a true and running Mercury out of Metalls; to which question he freely replyed, that he had never separated a true Mercury from any Metal; nor had ever seen it really done by any man else. And though Gold is, of all Metalls, That, whose Mercury Chymists have most endeavoured to extract, and which they do the most brag they have extracted; yet the Experienced Angelus Sala, in his Spagyrical account of the seven Terrestrial Planets (that is the seven metalls) affords us this memorable Testimony, to our present purpose; Quanquam (faies he) &c. experientia tamen (quam stultorum Magistrum vocamus) certe Comprobavit, Mercurium auri adeo fixum, maturum, & arcte cum reliquis ejusdem corporis substantiis conjungi, ut nullo modo retrogredi possit. To which he sub-joynes, Page 181that he himself had seen much Labour spent upon that Design, but could never see any such Mercury produc'd thereby. And I easily beleeve what he annexes; that he had often seen Detected many tricks and Impostures of Cheating Alchymists. For, the most part of those that are fond of such Charlatans, being unskilfull or Credulous, or both, 'tis very easie for such as have some Skill, much craft, more boldness, and no Conscience, to impose upon them; and therefore, though many profess'd Alchymists, and divers Persons of Quality have told me that they have made or seen the Mercury of Gold, or of this or that other Metal; yet I have been still apt to fear that either these persons have had a Design to deceive others; or have not had Skill and circumspection enough to keep themselves from being deceived. You recall to my mind (sayes Carneades) a certain Experiment I once devis'd, innocently to deceive some persons, and let them and others see how little is to be built upon the affirmation of those that are either unskillfull or unwary, when they tell us they have Image 102 (page 182)seen Alchymists make the Mercury of this or that Metal; and to make this the more evident, I made my Experiment much more Slight, Short and Simple, than the Chymists usuall processes to Extract Metalline Mercuries; which Operations being commonly more Elaborate and Intricate, and requiring a much more longer time, give the Alchymists a greater opportunity to Cozen, and Consequently are more Obnoxious to the Spectators suspicion. And that wherein I endeavour'd to make my Experiment look the more like a True Analysis, was, that I not only pretended as well as others to extract a Mercury from the Metal I wrought upon, but likewise to separate a large proportion of manifest and inflamable Sulphur. I take then, of the filings of Copper, about a Drachme or two, of common sublimate, powder'd, the like Weight, and Sal Armoniack near about as much as of Sublimate; these three being well mingl'd together I put into a small Vial with a long neck, or, which I find better, into a Glass Urinall, which (having first stopped it with Cotton) to avoid Page 183the Noxious Fumes, I approach by degrees to a competent Fire of well kindled coals, or (which looks better, but more endangers the Glass) to the Flame of a candle; and after a while the bottom of the Glass being held Just upon the Kindled Coals, or in the flame, You may in about a quarter of an Hour, or perchance in halfe that time, perceive in the Bottom of the Glass some running Mercury; and if then You take away the Glass and break it, You shall find a Parcel of Quicksilver, Perhaps altogether, and perhaps part of it in the pores of the Solid Mass; You shall find too, that the remaining Lump being held to the Flame of the Candle will readily burn with a greenish Flame, and after a little while (perchance presently) will in the Air Acquire a Greenish Blew, which being the Colour that is ascrib'd to Copper, when its Body is unlocked, 'Tis easie to perswade Men that this is the True Sulphur of Venus, especially since not only the Salts may be Suppos'd partly to be Flown away, and partly to be Sublim'd to the upper part of the Glass, whose inside (will Image 103 (page 184)Commonly appear Whitened by them) but the Metal seems to be quite Destroy'd, the Copper no longer appearing in a Metalline Forme, but almost in that of a Resinous Lump; whereas indeed the Case is only this, That the Saline parts of the Sublimate, together with the Sal Armoniack, being excited and actuated by the Vehement heat, fall upon the Copper, (which is a Metal they can more easily corrode, than silver) whereby the small parts of the Mercury being freed from the Salts that kept them asunder, and being by the heat tumbled up and down after many Occursions, they Convene into a Conspicuous Mass of Liquor; and as for the Salts, some of the more Volatile of them Subliming to the upper part of the Glass, the others Corrode the Copper, and uniting themselves with it do strangely alter and Disguise its Metallick Form, and compose with it a new kind of Concrete inflamable like Sulphur; concerning which I shall not now say any thing, since I can Referr You to the Diligent Observations which I remember Mr. Boyle has made concerning this Odde kind of Verdigrease. But Continues Page 185Carneades smiling, you know I was not cut out for a Mountebank, and therefore I will hasten to resume the person of a Sceptick, and take up my discourse where You diverted me from prosecuting it. In the next place, then, I consider, that, as there are some Bodies which yield not so many as the three Principles; so there are many others, that in their Resolution Exhibite more principles than three; and that therefore the Ternary Number is not that of the Universal and Adequate Principles of Bodies. If you allow of the Discourse I ately made You, touching the primary Associations of the small Particles of matter, You will scarce think it improbable, that of such Elementary Corpuscles there may be more sorts then either three, or four, or five. And if you will grant, what will scarce be deny'd, that Corpuscles of a compounded Nature may in all the wonted Examples of Chymists pass for Elementary, I see not, why you should think it impossible, that as Aqua Fortis, or Aqua Regis will make a Separation of colliquated Silver and Gold, though the Fire cannot; so there may be some Agent Image 104 (page 186)found out so subtile and so powerfull, at least in respect of those particular compounded Corpuscles, as to be able to resolve them into those more simple ones, whereof they consist, and consequently encrease the number of the Distinct Substances, whereinto the mixt Body has been hitherto thought resoluble. And if that be true, which I recited to you a while ago out of Helmont concerning the Operations of the Alkahest, which divides Bodies into other Distinct Substances, both as to number and Nature, then the Fire does; it will not a little countenance my Conjecture. But confining our selves to such wayes of Analyzing mix'd Bodies, as are already not unknown to Chymists, it may without Absurdity be Question'd, whether besides those grosser Elements of Bodies, which they call Salt Sulphur and Mercury, there may not be Ingredients of a more Subtile Nature, which being extreamly little, and not being in themselves Visible, may escape unheeded at the Junctures of the Destillatory Vessels, though never so carefully Luted. For let me observe to you one thing, which though Page 187not taken notice of by Chymists, may be a notion of good Use in divers Cases to a Naturalist, that we may well suspect, that there may be severall Sorts of Bodies, which are not Immediate Objects of any one of our senses; since we See, that not only those little Corpuscles that issue out of the Loadstone, and perform the Wonders for which it is justly admired; But the Effluviums of Amber, Jet, and other Electricall Concretes, though by their effects upon the particular Bodies dispos'd to receive their Action, they seem to fall under the Cognizance of our Sight, yet do they not as Electrical immediately Affect any of our senses, as do the bodies, whether minute or greater, that we See, Feel, Taste, &c. But, continues Carneades, because you may expect I should, as the Chymists do, consider only the sensible Ingredients of Mixt Bodies, let us now fee, what Experience will, even as to these, suggest to us. It seems then questionable enough, whether from Grapes variously order'd there may not be drawn more distinct Substances by the help of the Fire, then from most other mixt Bodies. For the Image 105 (page 188)Grapes themselves being dryed into Raysins and distill'd, will (besides Alcali, Phlegm, and Earth) yield a considerable quantity of an Empyreumatical Oyle, and a Spirit of a very different nature from that of Wine. Also the unfermented Juice of Grapes affords other distil'd Liquors then Wine doth. The Juice of Grapes after fermentation will yield a Spiritus Ardens; which if competently rectifyed will all burn away without leaving any thing remaining. The same fermented Juice degenerating into Vinager, yields an acid and corroding Spirit. The same Juice turn'd up, armes it self with Tartar; out of which may be separated, as out of other Bodies, Phlegme, Spirit, Oyle, Salt and Earth: not to mention what Substances may be drawn from the Vine it self, probably differing from those which are separated from Tartar, which is a body by it self, that has few resemblers in the World. And I will further consider that what force soever you will allow this instance, to evince that there are some Bodies that yield more Elements then others, it can scarce be deny'd but that the Major part of bodies that are divisible into Elements, Page 189yield more then three. For, besides those which the Chymists are pleased to name Hypostatical, most bodies contain two others, Phlegme and Earth, which concurring as well as the rest to the constitution of Mixts, and being as generally, if not more, found in their Analysis, I see no sufficient cause why they should be excluded from the number of Elements. Nor will it suffice to object, as the Paracelsians are wont to do, that the Tria prima are the most useful Elements, and the Earth and Water but worthlesse and unactive; for Elements being call'd so in relation to the constituting of mixt Bodies, it should be upon the account of its Ingrediency, not of its use, that any thing should be affirmed or denyed to be an Element: and as for the pretended uselessness of Earth and Water, it would be consider'd that usefulnesse, or the want of it, denotes only a Respect or Relation to us; and therefore the presence, or absence of it, alters not the Intrinsick nature of the thing. The hurtful Teeth of Vipers are for ought I know useless to us, and yet are not to be deny'd to be parts of their Bodies; and it were hard to shew of Image 106 (page 186)what greater Use to Us, then Phlegme and Earth, are those Undiscern'd Stars, which our New Telescopes discover to Us, in many Blanched places of the Sky; and yet we cannot but acknowledge them Constituent and Considerably great parts of the Universe. Besides that whether or no the Phlegme and Earth be immediately Useful, but necessary to constitute the Body whence they are separated; and consequently, if the mixt Body be not Useless to us, those constituent parts, without which it could not have been That mixt Body, may be said not to be Unuseful to Us: and though the Earth and Water be not so conspicuously Operative (after separation) as the other three more active Principles, yet in this case it will not be amiss to remember the lucky Fable of Menemius Aggrippa, of the dangerous Sedition of the Hands and Legs, and other more busie parts of the Body, against the seemingly unactive Stomack. And to this case also we may not unfitly apply that Reasoning of an Apostle, to another purpose; If the Ear shall say, because I am not the Eye, I am not of the Body; Is it therefore not of the Body? If the whole Page 187Body were Eye, where were the Hearing? If the whole were for hearing, where the smelling? In a word, since Earth and water appear, as clearly and as generally as the other Principles upon the resolution of Bodies, to be the Ingredients whereof they are made up; and fince they are useful, if not immediately to us, or rather to Physitians, to the Bodies they constitute, and so though in somewhat a remoter way, are serviceable to us; to exclude them out of the number of Elements, is not to imitate Nature. But, pursues Carneades, though I think it Evident, that Earth and Phlegme are to be reckon'd among the Elements of most Animal and Vegetable Bodies, yet 'tis not upon that Account alone, that I think divers Bodies resoluble into more Substances then three. For there are two Experiments, that I have sometimes made to shew, that at least some Mixts are divisible into more Distinct Substances then five. The one of these Experiments, though 'twill be more seasonable for me to mention it fully anon, yet in the mean time, I shall tell you thus much of it, That out of two Distill'd Liquors, Image 107 (page 192)which pass for Elements of the Bodies whence they are drawn, I can without Addition make a true Yellow and Inflamable Sulphur, notwithstanding that the two Liquors remain afterwards Distinct. Of the other Experiment, which perhaps will not be altogether unworthy your Notice, I must now give you this particular Account. I had long observ'd, that by the Destillation of divers Woods, both in Ordinary, and some unusuall sorts of Vessels, the Copious Spirit that came over, had besides a strong tast, to be mot with in the Empyreumaticall Spirits of many other Bodies, an Acidity almost like that of Vinager: Wherefore I suspected, that though the sowrish Liquor Distill'd, for Instance, from Box-Wood, be lookt upon by Chymists as barely the Spirit of it, and therefore as one single Element or Principle; yet it does really consist of two Differing Substances, and may be divisible into them; and consequently, that such Woods and other Mixts as abound with such a Vinager, may be said to consist of one Element or Principle, more then the Chymists as yet are Aware of; Wherefore bethinking Page 193my self, how the separation of these two Spirits might be made, I Quickly found, that there were several wayes of Compassing it. But that of them which I shall at present mention, was this, Having Destill'd a Quantity of Box-Wood per se, and slowly rectify'd the sowrish Spirit, the better to free it both from Oyle and Phlegme, I cast into this Rectify'd Liquor a convenient Quantity of Powder'd Coral, expecting that the Acid part of the Liquor would Corrode the Coral, and being associated with it would be so retain'd by it, that the other part of the Liquor, which was not of an acid Nature, nor fit to fasten upon the Corals, would be permitted to ascend alone. Nor was I deceiv'd in my Expectation; For having gently abstracted the Liquor from the Coralls; there came over a Spirit of a Strong smell, and of a tast very piercing, but without any sourness; and which was in diverse qualities manifestly different, not only from a Spirit of Vinager, but from some Spirit of the same Wood, that I purposely kept by me without depriving it of its acid Ingredient. And to satisfy you, that these two Substances were of Image 108 (page 194)a very differing Nature, I might informe you of several Tryals that I made, but must not name some of them, because I cannot do so without making some unseasonable discoveries. Yet this I shall tell you at present, that the sowre Spirit of Box, not only would, as I just now related, dissolve Corals, which the other would not fasten on, but being pour'd upon Salt of Tartar would immediately boile and hiss, whereas the other would lye quietly upon it. The acid Spirit pour'd upon Minium made a Sugar of Lead, which I did not find the other to do; some drops of this penetrant spirit being mingl'd with some drops of the blew Syrup of Violets seem'd rather to dilute then otherwise alter the colour; whereas the Acid Spirit turn'd the surup of a reddish colour, and would probably have made it of as pure a red as Acid Salts are wont to do, had not its operation been hindered by the mixture of the other Spirit. A few drops of the compound Spirit being Shaken into a pretty quantity of the infusion of Lignum Nephriticum, presently destroyed all the blewish colour, whereas the other Spirit would not take it away. To all which Page 195it might be added, that having for tryals sake pour'd fair water upon the Corals that remained in the bottom of the glass wherein I had rectifyed the double spirit (if I may so call it) that was first drawn from the Box, I found according to my expectation that the Acid Spirit had really dissolved the Corals, and had coagulated with them. For by the affusion of fair Water, I Obtain'd a Solution, which (to note that singularity upon the bye) was red, whence the Water being evaporated, there remained a soluble Substance much like the Ordinary Salt of Coral, as Chymists are pleas'd to call that Magistery of Corals, which they make by dissolving them in common spirit of Vinager, and abstracting the Menstruum ad Siccitatem. I know not whether I should subjoine, on this occasion, that the simple spirit of Box, if Chymists will have it therefore Saline because it has a strong tast, will furnish us with a new kind of Saline Bodies, differing from those hitherto taken notice of. For whereas of the three chief sorts of Salts, the Acid, the Alcalizate, and the Sulphureous, there is none that seems to be friends with both the other Image 109 (page 196)two, as I may, e're it be long, have occasion to shew; I did not find but that the simple spirit of Box did agree very well (at least as farr as I had occasion to try it) both with the Acid and the other Salts. For though it would lye very quiet with salt of Tartar, Spirit of Urine, or other bodies, whose Salts were either of an Alcalizate or fugitive Nature; yet did not the mingling of Oyle of Vitriol it self produce any hissing or Effervescence, which you know is wont to ensue upon the Affusion of that highly Acid Liquor upon eit her of the Bodies newly mentioned. I think my self, sayes Eleutherius, beholden to you, for this Experiment; not only because I forsee you will make it helpful to you in the Enquiry you are now upon, but because it teaches us a Method, whereby we may prepare a numerous sort of new spirits, which though more simple then any that are thought Elementary, are manifestly endow'd with peculiar and powerfull qualities, some of which may probably be of considerable use in Physick, as well alone, as associated with other things; as one may hopefully guess by the redness of Page 197that Solution your sour Spirit made of Corals, and by some other circumstances of your Narrative. And suppose (pursues Eleutherius) that you are not so confin'd, for the separation of the Acid parts of these compound Spirits from the other, to employ Corals; but that you may as well make use of any Alcalizate Salt, or of Pearls, or Crabs eyes, or any other Body, upon which common Spirit of Vinager will easily work, and, to speak in an Helmontian Phrase, Exantlate it self. I have not yet tryed, sayes Carneades, of what use the mention'd liquors may be in Physick, either as Medicines or as Menstruums: But I could mention now (and may another time) divers of the tryals that I made to satisfy my self of the difserence of these two Liquors. But that, as I allow you thinking what you newly told me about Corals, I presume you will allow me, from what I have said already, to deduce this Corollary; That there are divers compound bodies, which may be resolv'd into four such differing Substances, as may as well merit the name of Principles, as those to which the Chymists freely give it. For since they scruple Image 110 (page 198)not to reckon that which I call the compound Spirit of Box, for the spirit, or as others would have it, the Mercury of that Wood, I see not, why the Acid liquor, and the other, should not each of them, especially that last named, be lookt upon as more worthy to be called an Elementary Principle; since it must needs be of a more simple nature then the Liquor, which was found to be divisible into that, and the Acid Spirit. And this further use (continues Carneades) may be made of our experiment to my present purpose, that it may give us a rise to suspect, that since a Liquor reputed by the Chymists to be, without dispute, Homogeneous, is by so slight a way divisible into two distinct and more simple Ingredients, some more skilful or happier Experimenter then I may find a way either further to divide one of these Spirits, or to resolve some or other, if not all, of those other Ingredients of mixt Bodies, that have hitherto pass'd among Chymists for their Elements or Principles.

ANd thus much (sayes Carneades) may suffice to be said of the Number of the Distinct substances separable from mixt Bodies by the Fire: Wherefore I now proceed to consider the nature of them, and shew you, That though they seem Homogeneous Bodies, yet have they not the purity and simplicity that is requisite to Elements. And I should immediately proceed to the proof of my Assertion, but that the Confidence wherewith Chymists are wont to call each of the Substances we speak of by the name of Sulphur or Mercury, or the other of the Hypostaticall Image 111 (page 200)Principles, and the intollerable Ambiguity they allow themselves ie their Writings and Expressions, makes it necessary for me in Order to the Keeping you either from mistaking me, or thinking I mistake the Controversie, to take Notice to you and complain of the unreasonable Liberty they give themselves of playing with Names at pleasure. And indeed if I were oblig'd in this Dispute, to have such regard to the Phraseology of each particular Chymist, as not to Write any thing which this or that Author may not pretend, not to contradict this or that sence, which he may give as Occasion serves to his Ambiguous Expressions, I should scarce know how to dispute, nor which way to turn my self. For I find that even Eminent Writers, (such as Raymund Lully, Paracelsus and others) do so abuse the termes they employ, that as they will now and then give divers things, one name; so they will oftentimes give one thing, many Names; and some of them (perhaps) such, as do much more properly signifie some Distinct Body of another kind; nay even in Technical Words or Termes of Art, Page 201they refrain not from this Confounding Liberty; but will, as I have Observ'd, call the same Substance, sometimes the Sulphur, and Sometimes the Mercury of a Body. And now I speak of Mercury, I cannot but take Notice, that the Descriptions they give us of that Principle or Ingredient of. mixt Bodies, are so intricate, that even those that have Endeavour'd to Pollish and Illustrate the Notions of the Chymists, are fain to confess that they know not what to make of it, either by Ingenuous Acknowledgments, or Descriptions that are not Intelligible. I must confess (sayes Eleutherius) I have, in the reading of Paracelsus and other Chymical Authors, been troubled to find, that such hard Words and Equivocal Expressions, as You justly complain of, do even when they treat of Principles, seem to be studiously affected by those Writers; whether to make themselves to be admir'd by their Readers, and their Art appear more Venerable and Mysterious, or, (as they would have us think) to conceal from them a Knowledge themselves judge inestimable. Image 112 (page 202) But whatever (sayes Carneades) these Men may promise themselves from a Canting way of delivering the Principles of Nature, they will find the Major part of Knowing Men so vain, as when they understand not what they read, to conclude, that it is rather the Writers fault then their own. And those that are so ambitious to be admir'd by the Vulgar, that rather then go without the Admiration of the Ignorant they will expose themselves to the contempt of the Learned, those shall, by my consent, freely enjoy their Option. As for the Mystical Writers scrupling to Communicate their Knowledge, they might less to their own Disparagement, and to the trouble of their Readers, have conceal'd it by writing no Books, then by Writing bad ones. If Themistius were here, he would not stick to say, that Chymists write thus darkly, not because they think their Notions too precious to be explain'd, but because they fear that if they were explain'd, men would discern, that they are farr from being precious. And indeed, I fear that the chief Reason why Chymists have written so Page 203obscurely of their three Principles, may be, That not having Clear and Distinct Notions of them themselves, they cannot write otherwise then Confusedly of what they but Confusedly Apprehend: Not to say that divers of them, being Conscious to the Invalidity of their Doctrine, might well enough discerne that they could scarce keep themselves from being confuted, but by keeping themselves from being clearly understood. But though much may be said to Excuse the Chymists when they write Darkly, and Aenigmatically, about the Preparation of their Elixir, and Some few other grand Arcana, the divulging of which they may upon Grounds Plausible enough esteem unfit; yet when they pretend to teach the General Principles of Natural Philosophers, this Equivocall Way of Writing is not to be endur'd. For in such Speculative Enquities, where the naked Knowledge of the Truth is the thing Principally aim'd at, what does he teach me worth thanks that does not, if he can, make his Notion intelligible to me, but by Mystical Termes, and Ambiguous Phrases darkens what he should clear up; and makes Image 113 (page 204)me add the Trouble of guessing at the sence of what he Equivocally expresses, to that of examining the Truth of what he seems to deliver. And if the matter of the Philosophers Stone, and the manner of preparing it, be such Mysteries as they would have the World believe them, they may Write Intelligibly and Clearly of the Principles of mixt Bodies in General, without Discovering what they call the Great Work. But for my part (Continues Carneades) what my Indignation at this Un-philosophical way of teaching Principles has now extorted from me, is meant chiefly to excuse my self, if I shall hereafter oppose any Particular Opinion or assertion, that some Follower of Paracelsus or any Eminent Artist may pretend not to be his Masters. For, as I told you long since, I am not Oblig'd to examine private mens writings, (which were a Labour as endless as unprofitable) being only engag'd to examine those Opinions about the Tria Prima, which I find those Chymists I have met with to agree in most: And I Doubt not but my Arguments against their Doctrine will be in great part easily Page 205enough applicable ev'n to those private Opinions, which they do not so directly and expresly oppose. And indeed, that which I am now entering upon being the Consideration of the things themselves whereinto Spagyrists resolve mixt Bodies by the Fire, If I can shew that these are not of an Elementary Nature, it will be no great matter what names these or those Chymists have been pleased to give them. And I question not that to a Wise man, and consequently to Eleutherius, it will be lesse considerable to know, what Men Have thought of Things, then what they Should have thought. In the fourth and last place, then, I consider, that as generally as Chymists are wont to appeal to Experience, and as confidently as they use to instance the several substances separated by the Fire from a Mixt Body, as a sufficient proof of their being its component Elements: Yet those differing Substances are many of them farr enough from Elementary simplicity, and may be yet look'd upon as mixt Bodies, most of them also retaining, somewhat at least, if not very much, of the Nature of those Image 114 (page 206)Concretes whence they were forc'd. I am glad (sayes Eleutherius) to see the Vanity or Envy of the canting Chymists thus discover'd and chastis'd; and I could wish, that Learned Men would conspire together to make these deluding Writers sensible, that they must no longe hope with Impunity to abuse the World. For whilst such Men are quietly permitted to publish Books with promising Titles, and therein to Assert what they please, and contradict others, and ev'n themselves as they please, with as little danger of being confuted as of being understood, they are encourag'd to get themselves a name, at the cost of the Readers, by finding that intelligent Men are wont for the reason newly mention'd, to let their Books and Them alone: And the ignorant and credulous (of which the number is still much greater then that of the other) are forward to admire most what they least understand. But if Judicious men skill'd in Chymical affaires shall once agree to write clearly and plainly of them, and thereby keep men from being stunn'd, as it were, or imposd upon by dark or empty Words; 'tis to be hop'd that Page 207these men finding that they can no longer write impertinently and absurdly, without being laugh'd at for doing so, will be reduc'd either to write nothing, or Books that may teach us something, and not rob men, as formerly, of invaluable Time; and so ceasing to trouble the World with Riddles or Impertinencies, we shall either by their Books receive an Advantage, or by their silence escape an Inconvenience. But after all this is said (continues Eleutherius) it may be represented in favour of the Chymists, that, in one regard the Liberty they take in using names, if it be excusable at any time, may be more so when they speak of the substances whereinto their Analysis resolves mixt Bodies: Since as Parents have the Right to name their own Children, it has ever been allow'd to the Authors of new Inventions, to Impose Names upon them. And therefore the subjects we speak of being so the Productions of the Chymist's Art, as not to be otherwise, but by it, obtainable; it seems but equitable to give the Artists leave to name them as they please: considering also that none are so fit and likely to teach us what those Bodies Image 115 (page 208)are, as they to whom we ow'd them. I told You already (sayes Carneades) that there is great Difference betwixt the being able to make Experiments, and the being able to give a Philosophical Account of them. And I will not now add, that many a Mine-digger may meet, whilst he follows his work, with a Gemm or a Mineral which he knowes not what to make of, till he shews it a Jeweller or a Mineralist to be inform'd what it is. But that which I would rather have here observ'd, is, That the Chymists I am now in debate with have given up the Liberty You challeng'd for them, of using Names at Pleasure, and confin'd Themselves by their Descriptions, though but such as they are, of their Principles; so that although they might freely have call'd any thing their Analysis presents them with, either Sulphur, or Mercury, or Gas, or Blas, or what they pleas'd; yet when they have told me that Sulphur (for instance) is a Primogeneal and simple Body, Inflamable, Odorous, &c. they must give me leave to dis-believe them, if they tell me that a Body that is either compounded or uninflamable is Page 209such a Sulphur; and to think they play with words, when they teach that Gold and some other Minerals abound with an Incombustible Sulphur, which is as proper an Expression, as a Sun-shine Night, or Fluid Ice. But before I descend to the Mention of Particulars belonging to my Fourth Consideration, I think it convenient to premise a few Generals; some of which I shall the less need to insist on at present, because I have Touched on them already. And first I must invite you to take notice of a certain passage in Helmont; Illud notabile, in vino esse Spiritum quendam mitiorem ulterioris & nobilioris qualitatis participem qua qui immediat�per distillationem elicitur diciturque aqua vitae dephlegmata, quod facilius in simplici Olivarum oleo ad oculum spectatur. Quippe distillatum oleum absque laterum aut tigularum additamento, quodque oleum Philosophorum dicitur, multum differt ab ejus oleitate, quae elicitur prius reducto oleo simplici in partes dissimilares sola digestione & Salis circulati Paracelsici appositione; siquidem sal circulatum idem in pondere & quantitatibus pristinis ab oleo segregatur postquam oleum olivarum in sui beterogeneitates est dispositum. Dulce enim tunc Oleum Olivarum exoleo, prout & suavissimus vini spiritus a vino hoc pacto separantur, long�que ab aquae vitae acrimoni� distinctus.  Helmont. Aura vitalis, pag. 725. which though I have not Found much heeded by his Readers, He Himself mentions as a notable thing, and I take to be a very considerable one; for whereas the Distill'd oyle of oyle-olive, though Image 116 (page 210)drawn per se is (as I have try'd) of a very sharp and fretting Quality, and of an odious tast, He tells us that Simple oyle being only digested with Paracelsus's sal circulatum, is reduc'd into dissimilar parts, and yields a sweet Oyle, very differing from the oyledistill'd, from sallet oyle; as also that by the same way there may be separated from Wine a very sweet and gentle Spirit, partaking of a far other and nobler quality then that which is immediately drawn by distillation and call'd Dephlegm'd Aqua vitae, from whose Acrimony this other spirit is exceedingly remote, although the sal circulatum that makes these Anatomies be separated from the Analyz'd Bodies, in the same weight and with the same qualities it had before; which Affirmation of Helmont if we admit to be true, we must acknowledge that there may be a very great disparity betwixt bodies of the same denomination (as several oyles, or several spirits) separable from compound Bodies: For, besides the differences I shall anon take notice of, betwixt those distill'd Oyles that are commonly known to Chymists, it appears by this, that by means of the Sal Circulatum, There may Page 211be quite another sort of Oyles obtain'd from the same Body; and who knowes but that there may be yet other Agents found in Nature, by whose help there may, whether by Transmutation or otherwise, be obtain'd from the Bodies Vulgarly call'd Mixt, Oyles or other substances, Differing from those of the same Denomination, known either to Vulgar Chymists, or even to Helmont Himself: but for fear You should tell me, that this is but a conjecture grounded upon another Man's Relation, whose Truth we have not the means to Experiment, I will not Insist upon it; but leaving You to Consider of it at leasure, I shall proceed to what is next. Secondly, Then if that be True which was the Opinion of Lucippus, Democritus, and other prime Anatomists of old, and is in our dayes reviv'd by no mean Philosophers; namely, That our Culinary Fire, such as Chymists use, consists of swarmes of little Bodies swiftly moving, which by their smallness and motion are able to permeate the sollidest and Compactest Bodies, and even Glass it Self; If this (I say) be True, since we see that In flints and other Concretes, Image 117 (page 212)the Fiery part is Incorporated with the Grosser, it will not be Irrationall to conjecture, that multitudes of these Fiery Corpuscles, getting in at the Pores of the Glass, may associate themselves with the parts of the mixt Body whereon they work, and with them Constitute new Kinds of Compound Bodies, according as the Shape, Size, and other Affections of the Parts of the Dissipated Body happen to dispose them, in Reference to such Combinations; of which also there may be the greater Number; if it be likewise granted that the Corpuscles of the Fire, though all exceeding minute, and very swiftly moved, are not all of the same bigness, nor Figure. And if I had not Weightier Considerations to Discourse to you of, I could name to you, to Countenance what I have newly said, some particular Experiments by which I have been Deduc'd to think, that the Particles of an open Fire working upon some Bodies may really Associate themselves therewith, and add to the Quantity. But because I am not so sure, that when the Fire works upon Bodies included in Glasses, it does it by a reall Trajection Page 213of the Fiery Corpuscles themselves, through the Substance of the Glass, I will proceed to what is next to be mention'd. I could (sayes Eleutherius) help you to some Proofes, whereby I think it may be made very probable, that when the Fire acts immediately upon a Body, some of its Corpuscles may stick to those of the burnt Body, as they seem to do in Quicklime, but in greater numbers, and more permanently. But for fear of retarding Your Progress, I shall desire you to deferr this Enquiry till another time, and proceed as you intended. You may then in the next place (sayes Carneades) observe with me, that not only there are some Bodies, as Gold, and Silver, which do not by the usual Examens, made by Fire, Discover themselves to be mixt; but if (as You may Remember I formerly told You) it be a De-compound Body that is Dissipable into several Substances, by being expos'd to the Fire it may be resolv'd into such a; are neither Elementary, nor such as it was upon its last mixture Compounded of; but into new Image 118 (page 214)Kinds of mixts. Of this I have already given You some Examples in Sope, Sugar of Lead, and Vitrioll. Now if we shall Consider that there are some Bodies, as well Natural, (as that I last nam'd) as Factitious, manifestly Decompounded; That in the Bowells of the Earth Nature may, as we see she sometimes does, make strange Mixtures; That Animals are nourish'd with other Animals and Plants; And, that these themselves have almost all of them their Nutriment and Growth, either from a certain Nitrous Juice Harbour'd in the Pores of the Earth, or from the Excrements of Animalls, or from the putrify'd Bodies, either of living Creatures or Vegetables, or from other Substances of a Compounded Nature; If, I say, we consider this, it may seem probable, that there may be among the Works of Nature (not to mention those of Art) a greater Number of De-compound Bodies, then men take Notice of; And indeed, as I have formerly also observ'd, it does not at all appear, that all Mixtures must be of Elementary Bodies; but it seems farr more probable, that there are divers sorts of Page 215compound Bodies, even in regard of all or some of their Ingredients, consider'd Antecedently to their Mixture. For though some seem to be made up by the immediate Coalitions of the Elements, or Principles themselves, and therefore may be call'd Prima Mista, or Mista Primaria; yet it seems that many other Bodies are mingl'd (if I may so speak) at the second hand, their immediate Ingredients being not Elementary, but these primary Mixts newly spoken of; And from divers of these Secondary sort of Mixts may result, by a further Composition, a Third sort, and so onwards. Nor is it improbable, that some Bodies are made up of Mixt Bodies, not all of the same Order, but of several; as (for Instance) a Concrete may consist of Ingredients, whereof the one may have been a primary, the other a Secondary Mixt Body; (as I have in Native Cinnaber, by my way of Resolving it, found both that Courser the part that seems more properly to be Oar, and a Combustible Sulphur, and a Running Mercury:) or perhaps without any Ingredient of this latter sort, it may be compos'd of Mixt Bodies, some of Image 119 (page 216)them of the first, and some of the third Kind; And this may perhaps be somewhat Illustrated by reflecting upon what happens in some Chymical Preparations of those Medicines which they call their Bezoardicum's. For first, they take Antimony and Iron, which may be look'd upon as Prima Mista; of these they compound a Starry Regulus, and to this they add according to their Intention, either Gold, or Silver, which makes with it a new and further Composition. To this they add Sublimate, which is it self a De-compound body, (consisting of common Quicksilver, and divers Salts United by Sublimation into a Crystalline Substance) and from this Sublimate, and the other Metalline Mixtures, they draw a Liquor, which may be allow'd to be of a yet more Compounded Nature. If it be true, as Chymists affirm it, that by this Art some of the Gold or Silver mingl'd with the Regulus may be carry'd over the Helme with it by the Sublimate; as indeed a Skilfull and Candid person complain'd to me a while since, That an experienc'd Friend of His and mine, having by such a way brought over a Page 217great Deal of Gold, in hope to do something further with it, which might be gainfull to him, has not only miss'd of his Aim, but is unable to recover his Volatiliz'd Gold out of the Antimonial butter, wherewith it is strictly united. Now (Continues Carneades) if a Compound body consist of Ingredients that are not meerly Elementary; it is not hard to conceive, that the Substances into which the Fire Dissolves it, though seemingly Homogeneous enough, may be of a Compounded Nature, those parts of each body that are most of Kin associating themselves into a Compound of a new Kind. As when (for example sake) I have caus'd Vitrioll and Sal Armoniack, and Salt Petre to be mingl'd and Destill'd together, the Liquor that came over manifested it self not to be either Spirit of Nitre, or of Sal Armoniack, or of Vitrioll. For none of these would dissolve crude gold, which yet my Liquor was able readily to do; and thereby manifested it self to be a new Compound, consisting at least of Spirit of Nitre, and Sal Armoniack, (for the latter dissolv'd in the former, Image 120 (page 218)will Work on Gold) which nevertheless are not by any known way separable, and consequently would not pass for a Mixt Body, if we our selves did not, to obtain it, put and Distill together divers Concretes, whose Distinct Operations were known before hand. And, to add on this Occasion the Experiment I lately promis'd You, because it is Applicable to our present purpose, I shall Acquaint You, that suspecting the Common Oyle of Vitrioll not to be altogether such a simple Liquor as Chymists presume it, I mingl'd it with an equal or a Double Quantity (for I try'd the Experiment more then once) of common Oyle of Turpentine, such as together with the other Liquor I bought at the Drugsters. And having carefully (for the Experiment is Nice, and somewhat dangerous) Distill'd the Mixture in a small Glass Retort, I obtain'd according to my Desire, (besides the two Liquors I had put in) a pretty Quantity of a certain substance, which sticking all about the Neck of the Retort Discover'd it self to be Sulphur, not only by a very strong Sulphureous smell, and by the colour of Page 219Brimstone; but also by this, That being put upon a coal, it was immediately kindl'd, and burn'd like common Sulphur. And of this Substance I have yet by me some little Parcells, which You may command and examine when you please. So that from this Experiment I may deduce either one, or both of these Propositions, That a real Sulphur may be made by the Conjunction of two such Substances as Chymists take for Elementary, And which did not either of them apart appear to have any such body in it; or that Oyle of Vitrioll though a Distill'd Liquor, and taken for part of the Saline Principle of the Concrete that yields it, may yet be so Compounded a body as to contain, besides its Saline part, a Sulphur like common brimstone, which would hardly be it self a simple or un-compounded body. I might (pursues Carneades) remind You, that I formerly represented it, as possible, That as there may be more Elements then five, or six; so the Elements of one body may be Different from those of another; whence it would follow, that from the Resolution of Decompound Image 121 (page 220)compound body, there may result Mixts of an altogether new kind, by the Coalition of Elements that never perhaps conven'd before. I might, I say, mind You of this, and add divers things to this second Consideration; but for fear of wanting time I willingly pretermit them, to pass on to the third, which is this, That the Fire does not alwayes barely resolve or take asunder, but may also after a new manner mingle and compound together the parts (whether Elementary or not) of the Body Dissipated by it. This is so evident, sayes Carneades, in some obvious Examples, that I cannot but wonder at their Supiness that have not taken notice of it. For when Wood being burnt in a Chimney is dissipated by the Fire into Smoke and Ashes, that smoke composes soot, which is so far from being any one of the principles of the Wood, that (as I noted above) you may by a further Anlysis separate five or six distinct substances from it. And as for the remaining Ashes, the Chymists themselves teach us, that by a further degree of fire they may be indissolubly united into glass. 'Tis true, that the Analysis Page 221which the Chymists principally build upon is made, not in the open air, but in close Vessels; but however, the Examples lately produc'd may invite you shrewdly to suspect, That heat may as well compound as dissipate the Parts of mixt Bodies: and not to tell you, that I have known a Vitrification made even in close vessels, I must remind you that the Flowers of Antimony, and those of Sulphur, are very mix'd Bodies, though they ascend in close vessells: And that 'twas in stopt glasses that I brought up the whole Body of Camphire. And whereas it may be objected, that all these Examples are of Bodies forc'd up in a dry, not a Fluid forme, as are the Liquors wont to be obtain'd by distillation; I answer, That besides that 'tis possible, that a Body may be chang'd from Consistent to Fluid, or from Fluid to Consistent, without being otherwise much altered, as may appear by the Easiness wherewith in Winter, without any Addition or Separation of Visible Ingredients, the same substance may be quickly harden'd into brittle Ice, and thaw'd again into Fluid Water; Besides this, I say it would be consider'd, that common Image 122 (page 222)Quick-silver it self, which the Eminentest Chymists confess to be a mixt Body, may he Driven over the Helme in its Pristine forme of Quicksilver, and consequently, in that of a Liquor. And certainly 'tis possible that very compounded Bodies may concur to Constitute Liquors; Since, not to mention that I have found it possible, by the help of a certain Menstruum, to distill Gold it self through a Retort, even with a Moderate Fire: Let us but consider what happens in Butter of Antimony. For if that be carefully rectify'd, it may be reduc'd into a very clear Liquor; and yet if You cast a quantity of fair water upon it, there will quickly precipitate a Ponderous and Vomitive Calx, which made before a considerable part of the Liquor, and yet is indeed (though some eminent Chymists would have it Mercurial) an Antimonial Body carryed over and kept dissolv'd by the Salts of the Sublimate, and consequently a compounded one; as You may find if You will have the Curiosity to Examine this White powder by a skilful Reduction. And that You may not think that Bodies as compounded as flowers of Brimstone cannot be brought Page 223to Concurr to Constitute Distill'd Liquors; And also That You may not imagine with Divers Learned Men that pretend no small skill in Chymistry, that at least no mixt Body can be brought over the Helme, but by corrosive Salts, I am ready to shew You, when You please, among other wayes of bringing over Flowers of Brimstone (perhaps I might add even Mineral Sulphurs) some, wherein I employ none but Oleaginous bodies to make Volatile Liquors, in which not only the colour, but (which is a much surer mark) the smell and some Operations manifest that there is brought over a Sulphur that makes part of the Liquor. One thing more there is, Eleutherius, sayes Carneades, which is so pertinent to my present purpose, that though I have touch'd upon it before, I cannot but on this occasion take notice of it. And it is this, That the Qualities or Accidents, upon whose account Chymists are wont to call a portion of Matter by the name of Mercury or some other of their Principles, are not such but that 'tis possible as Great (and therefore why not the like?) may be produc'd by such changes Image 123 (page 224)of Texture, and other Alterations, as the Fire may make in the small Parts of a Body. I have already prov'd, when I discours'd of the second General Consideration, by what happens to plants nourish'd only with fair water, and Eggs hatch'd into Chickens, that by changing the disposition of the component parts of a Body, Nature is able to effect as great Changes in a parcell of Matter reputed similar, as those requisite to Denominate one of the Tria Prima. And though Helmont do somewhere wittily call the Fire the Destructor and the Artificial Death of Things; And although another Eminent Chymist and Physitian be pleas'd to build upon this, That Fire can never generate any thing but Fire; Yet You will, I doubt not, be of another mind, If You consider how many new sorts of mixt Bodies Chymists themselves have produc'd by means of the Fire: And particularly, if You consider how that Noble and Permanent Body, Glass, is not only manifestly produc'd by the violent action of the Fire, but has never, for ought we know, been produc'd any other way. And indeed it seems but an inconsiderate Assertion of Page 225some Helmontians, that every sort of Body of a Peculiar Denomination must be produc'd by some Seminal power; as I think I could evince, if I thought it so necessary, as it is for me to hasten to what I have further to discourse. Nor need it much move us, that there are some who look upon whatsoever the Fire is employ'd to produce, not as upon Natural but Artificial Bodies. For there is not alwaies such a difference as many imagine betwixt the one and the other: Nor is it so easy as they think, clearly to assigne that which Properly, Constantly, and Sufficiently, Discriminates them. But not to engage my self in so nice a Disquisition, it may now suffice to observe, that a thing is commonly termed Artificial, when a parcel of matter is by the Artificers hand, or Tools, or both, brought to such a shape or Form, as he Design'd before-hand in his Mind: Whereas in many of the Chymical Productions the effect would be produc'd whether the Artificer intended it or no; and is oftentimes very much other then he Intended or Look't for; and the Instruments employ'd, are not Tools Artificially fashion'd and Image 124 (page 226)shaped, like those of Tradesmen, for this or that particular Work; but, for the most part, Agents of Nature's own providing, and whose chief Powers of Operation they receive from their own Nature or Texture, not the Artificer. And indeed, the Fire is as well a Natural Agent as Seed: And the Chymist that imployes it, does but apply Natural Agents and Patients, who being thus brought together, and acting according to their respective Natures, performe the worke themselves; as Apples, Plums, or other fruit, are natural Productions, though the Gardiner bring and fasten together the Sciens of the Stock, and both Water, and do perhaps divers other wayes Contribute to its bearing fruit. But, to proceed to what I was going to say, You may observe with me, Eleutherius, that, as I told You once before, Qualities sleight enough may serve to Denominate a Chymical Principle. For, when they anatomize a compound Body by the Fire, if they get a Substance inflamable, and that will not mingle with Water, that they presently call Sulphur; what is sapid and Dissoluble in Water, that must passe for Salt; Whatsoever is Page 227fix'd and indissoluble in Water, that they name Earth. And I was going to add, that, whatsoever Volatile substance they know not what to make of, not to say, whatsoever they please, that they call Mercury. But that these Qualities may either be produc'd, otherwise then by such as they call Seminal Agents, or may belong to bodies of a compounded Nature, may be shewn, among other Instances, in Glass made of ashes, where the exceeding strongly-tasted Alcalizate Salt joyning with the Earth becomes insipid, and with it constitutes a Body, which though also dry, fixt, and indissoluble in Water, is yet manifestly a mixt Body; and made so by the Fire it self. And I remmember to our present purpose, that Helmont, amongst other Medicines that he commends, has a short processe, wherein, though the Directions for Practice are but obscurely intimated; yet I have some reason not to Dis-believe the Process, without affirming or denying any thing about the vertues of the remedy to be made by it. Helment pag. 412. Quando (sayes he) oleum cinnamomi &c. suo sali alkali miscetur absque omni aqua, trium mensium artificiosa occultaque circulatione, totum in salem volatilem Image 125 (page 228)commutatum est, vere essentiam sui simplicis in nobis exprimit, & usque in prima nostri constitutivasese ingerit. A not unlike Processe he delivers in another place; from whence, if we suppose him to say true, I may argue, that since by the Fire there may be produc'd a substance that is as well Saline and volatile as the Salt of Harts-horn, blood, &c. which pass for Elementary; and since that this Volatile Salt is really compounded of a Chymical Oyle and a fixt Salt, the one made Volatile by the Other, and both associated by the fire, it may well be suspected that other Substances, emerging upon the Dissipation of Bodies by the Fire, may be new sorts of Mixts, and consist of Substances of differing natures; and particularly, I have sometimes suspected, that since the Volatile Salts of Blood, Harts-horn, &c. are figitive and endow'd with an exceeding strong smell, either that Chymists do Erroneously ascribe all odours to sulphurs, or that such Salts consist of some oyly parts well incorporated with the Saline ones. And the like conjecture I have also made concerning Spirit of Vinager, which, though the Chymists think one of the Principles Page 229of that Body, and though being an Acid Spirit it seems to be much less of kin then Volatile Salts to sulphurs; yet, not to mention its piercing smell; which I know not with what congruity the Chymist will deduce from Salt, I wonder they have not taken notice of what their own Tyrocinium Chymicum teach us concerning the Destillation of Saccharum Saturni; out of which Beguinus assures Us, Tyroc. Chym. L. 1. C. 4. that he distill'd, besides a very fine spirit, no lesse then two Oyles, the one bloodred and ponderous, but the other swimming upon the top of the Spirit, and of a yellow colour; of which he sayes that he kept then some by him, to verify what he delivers. And though I remember not that I have had two distinct Oyles from Sugar of Lead, yet that it will though distill'd without addition yield some Oyle, disagrees not with my Experience. I know the Chymists will be apt to pretend, that these Oyls are but the volatiliz'd sulphur of the lead; and will perhaps argue it from what Beguinus relates, that when the Distillation is ended, you'l find a Caput Mortuum extreamly black, and (as he speaks) nullius momenti, as if the Body, or at least the chief part of Image 126 (page 230)the Metal it self were by the distillation carried over the Helme. But since you know as well as I that Saccharum Saturni is a kind of Magistery, made only by calcining of Lead per se, dissolving it in distill'd Vinager, and crystalizing the solution; if I had leasure to tell You how Differing a thing I did upon examination find the Caput Mortuum, so sleighted by Beguinus, to be from what he represents it, I believe you would think the conjecture propos'd less probable then one or other of these three; either that this Oyle did formerly concur to constitute the Spirit of Vinager, and so that what passes for a Chymical Principle may yet be further resoluble into distinct substances; or that some parts of the Spirit together with some parts of the Lead may constitute a Chymical Oyle, which therefore though it pass for Homogeneous, may be a very compounded Body: or at least that by the action of the Distill'd Vinager and the Saturnine Calx one upon another, part of the Liquor may be so alter'd as to be transmuted from an Acid Spirit into an Oyle. And though the truth of either of the two former conjectures would make the example I Page 231have reflected on more pertinent to my present argument; yet you'l easily discern, the Third and last Conjecture cannot be unserviceable to confirm some other passages of my discourse. To return then to what I was saying just before I mention'd Helmont's Experiment, I shall subjoyne, That Chymists must confess also that in the perfectly Dephlegm'd spirit of Wine, or other Fermented Liquors, that which they call the Sulphur of the Concrete loses, by the Fermentation, the Property of Oyle, (which the Chymists likewise take to be the true Sulphur of the Mixt) of being unminglable with the Water. Ostendi alias, quomodo lib. una aquae vitae combibita in sale Tartari siccato, vix fiat semuncia salis, caeterum totum corpus fiat aqua Elementalis. Helmont. in Aura vitali. And if You will credit Helmont, all of the purest Spirit of Wine may barely by the help of pure Salt of Tartar (which is but the fixed Salt of Wine) be resolv'd or Transmuted into scarce half an ounce of Salt, and as much Elementary Water as amounts to the remaining part of the mention'd weight. And it may (as I think I formerly also noted) be doubted, whether that Fixt and Alcalizate Salt, which is so unanimously agreed on to be the Saline Principle of incinerated Bodies, be not, Image 127 (page 232)as 'tis Alcalizate, a Production of the Fire? For though the tast of Tartar, for Example, seem to argue that it contains a Salt before it be burn'd, yet that Salt being very Acid is of a quite Differing Tast from the Lixiviate Salt of Calcin'd Tartar. And though it be not truly Objected against the Chymists, that they obtain all Salts they make, by reducing the Body they work on into Ashes with Violent Fires, (since Hartshorn, Amber, Blood, and divers other Mixts yield a copious Salt before they be burn'd to Ashes) yet this Volatile Salt Differs much, as we shall see anon, from the Fixt Alcalizate Salt I speak of; which for ought I remember is not producible by any known Way, without Incineration. 'Tis not unknown to Chymists, that Quicksilver may be Precipitated, without Addition, into a dry Powder, that remains so in Water. And some eminent Spagyrists, and even Raimund Lully himself, teach, that meerly by the Fire Quicksilver may in convenient Vessels be reduc'd (at least in great part) into a thin Liquor like Water, and minglable with it. So that by the bare Action Page 233of the Fire, 'tis possible, that the parts of a mixt Body should be so dispos'd after new and differing manners, that it may be sometimes of one consistence, sometimes of another; And may in one State be dispos'd to be mingl'd with Water, and in another not. I could also shew you, that Bodies from which apart Chymists cannot obtain any thing that is Combustible, may by being associated together, and by the help of the Fire, afford an inflamable Substance. And that on the other side, 'tis possible for a Body to be inflamable, from which it would very much puzzle any ordinary Chymist, and perhaps any other, to separate an inflamable Principle or Ingredient. Wherefore, since the Principles of Chymists may receive their Denominations from Qualities, which it often exceeds not the power of Art, nor alwayes that of the Fire to produce; And since such Qualities may be found in Bodies that differ so much in other Qualities from one another, that they need not be allow'd to agree in that pure and simple Nature, which Principles, to be so indeed, must have; it may Image 128 (page 234)justly be suspected, that many Productions of the Fire that are shew'd us by Chymists, as the Principles of the Concrete that afforded them, may be but a new kind of Mixts. And to annex, on this Occasion, to these arguments taken from the Nature of the thing, one of those which Logicians call ad Hominem, I shall desire You to take Notice, that though Paracelsus Himself, and some that are so mistaken as to think he could not be so, have ventur'd to teach, that not only the bodies here below, but the Elements themselves, and all the other Parts of the Universe, are compos'd of Salt, Sulphur and Mercury; yet the learned Sennertus, and all the more wary Chymists, have rejected that conceit, and do many of them confess, that the Tria Prima are each of them made up of the four Elements; and others of them make Earth and Water concur with Salt, Sulphur and Mercury, to the Constitution of Mixt bodies. So that one sort of these Spagyrists, notwithstanding the specious Titles they give to the productions of the Fire, do in effect grant what I contend for. And, of the other Page 235sort I may well demand, to what Kind of Bodies the Phlegme and dead Earth, to be met with in Chymical Resolutions, are to be referr'd? For either they must say, with Paracelsus, but against their own Concessions as well as against Experience, that these are also compos'd of the Tria Prima, whereof they cannot separate any one from either of them; or else they must confess that two of the vastest Bodies here below, Earth, and Water, are neither of them compos'd of the Tria Prima; and that consequently those three are not the Universal, and Adequate Ingredients, neither of all Sublunary Bodies, nor even of all mixt Bodies. I know that the chief of these Chymists represent, that though the Distinct Substances into which they divide mixt bodies by the Fire, are not pure and Homogeneous; yet since the four Elements into which the Aristotelians pretend to resolve the like bodies by the same Agent, are not simple neither, as themselves acknowledge, 'tis as allowable for the Chymists to call the one Principles, as for the Peripateticks to call the other Elements; since in both cases the Image 129 (page 236)Imposition of the name is grounded only upon the Predominancy of that Element whose name is ascrib'd to it. Nor shall I deny, that this Argument of the Chymists is no ill one against the Aristotelians. But what Answer can it prove to me, who you know am disputing against the Aristotelian Elements, as the Chymicall Principles, and must not look upon any body as a true Principle or Element, but as yet compounded, which is not perfectly Homogeneous, but is further Resoluble into any number of Distinct Substances how small soever. And as for the Chymists calling a body Salt, or Sulphur, or Mercury, upon pretence that the Principle of the same name is predominant in it, That it self is an Acknowledgment of what I contend for; namely that these productions of the Fire, are yet compounded bodies. And yet whilst this is granted, it is affirm'd, but not prov'd, that the reputed Salt, or Sulphur, or Mercury, consists mainly of one body that deserves the name of a principle of the same Denomination. For how do Chymists make it appear that there are any such primitive and simple bodies Page 237in those we are speaking of; since 'tis upon the matter confess'd by the answer lately made, that these are not such? And if they pretend by Reason to evince what they affirm, what becomes of their confident boasts, that the Chymists (whom they therefore, after Beguinus, call a Philosophus or Opifex Sensatus) can convince our Eyes, by manifestly shewing in any mixt body those simple substances he teaches them to be compos'd of? And indeed, for the Chymists to have recourse in this case to other proofs then Experiments, as it is to wave the grand Argument that has all this while been given out for a Demonstrative One; so it releases me from the obligation to prosecute a Dispute wherein I am not engag'd to Examine any but Experimentall proofs. I know it may plausibly Enough be Represented, in favour of the Chymists, that it being evident that much the greater part of any thing they call Salt, or Sulphur, or Mercury, is really such; it would be very rigid to deny those Substances the names ascribed them, only because of some sleight mixture of another Body; since not only the Peripateticks call particular parcels of Image 130 (page 238)matter Elementary, though they acknowledge that Elements are not to be anywhere found pure, at least here below; And since especially there is a manifest Analogie and Resemblance betwixt the bodies obtainable by Chymical Anatomies and the principles whose names are given them; I have, I say, consider'd that these things may be represented: But as for what is drawn from the Custome of the Peripateticks, I have already told You, that though it may be employ'd against Them, Yet it is not available against me who allow nothing to be an Element that is not perfectly Homogeneous. And whereas it is alledg'd, that the Predominant Principle ought to give a name to the substance wherein it abounds; I answer, that that might much more reasonably be said, if either we or the Chymists had seen Nature take pure Salt, pure Sulphur, and pure Mercury, and compound of them every sort of Mixt Bodies. But, since 'tis to experience that they appeal, we must not take it for granted, that the Distill'd Oyle (for instance) of a plant is mainly compos'd of the pure principle call'd Sulphur, till they have given us an ocular proof, Page 239that there is in that sort of Plants such an Homogeneous Sulphur. For as for the specious argument, which is drawn from the Resemblance betwixt the Productions of the Fire, and the Respective, either Aristotelian Elements, or Chymical Principles, by whose names they are call'd; it will appear more plausible then cogent, if You will but recall to mind the state of the controversie; which is not, whether or no there be obtain'd from mixt Bodies certain substances that agree in outward appearance, or in some Qualities with Quicksilver or Brimstone, or some such obvious or copious Body; But whether or no all Bodies confess'd to be perfectly mixt were compos'd of, and are resoluble into a determinate number of primary unmixt Bodies. For, if you keep the state of the question in your Eye, you'l easily discerne that there is much of what should be Demonstrated, left unprov'd by those Chymical Experiments we are Examining. But (not to repeat what I have already discover'd more at large) I shall now take notice, that it will not presently follow, that because a Production of the Fire has some affinity with some of the greater Masses Image 131 (page 240)of matter here below, that therefore they are both of the same Nature, and deserve the same Name; for the Chymists are not content, that flame should be look't upon as a parcel of the Element of Fire, though it be hot, dry, and active, because it wants some other Qualities belonging to the nature of Elementary fire. Nor will they let the Peripateticks call Ashes, or Quicklime, Earth, notwithstanding the many likenesses between them; because they are not tastlesse, as Elementary Earth ought to be: But if you should ask me, what then it is, that all the Chymical Anatomies of Bodies do prove, if they prove not that they consist of the three Principles into which the fire resolves them? I answer, that their Dissections may be granted to prove, that some mixt bodies (for in many it will not hold) are by the fire, when they are included in close Vessels, (for that Condition also is often requisite) dissolube into several Substances differing in some Qualities, but principally in Consistence. So that out of most of them may be obtain'd a fixt substance partly saline, and partly insipid, an unctuous Liquor, and another Liquor or Page 241more that without being unctuous have a manifest taste. Now if Chymists will agree to call the dry and sapid substance salt, the Unctuous liquor Sulphur, and the other Mercury, I shall not much quarrel with them for so doing: But if they will tell me that Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury, are simple and primary bodies whereof each mixt body was actually compounded, and which was really in it antecedently to the operation of the fire, they must give me leave to doubt whether (whatever their other arguments may do) their Experiments prove all this. And if they will also tell me that the Substances their Anatomies are wont to afford them, are pure and similar, as Principles ought to be, they must give me leave to believe my own senses; and their own confessions, before their bare Assertions. And that you may not (Eleutherius) think I deal so rigidly with them, because I scruple to Take these Productions of the Fire for such as the Chymists would have them pass for, upon the account of their having some affinity with them; consider a little with me, that in regard an Element or Principle ought to be perfectly Similar and Image 132 (page 242)Homogeneous, there is no just cause why I should rather give the body propos'd the Name of this or that Element or Principle, because it has a resemblance to it in some obvious Quality, rather then deny it that name upon the account of divers other Qualities, wherein the propos'd Bodies are unlike; and if you do but consider what sleight and easily producible qualities they are that suffice, as I have already more then once observ'd, to Denominate a Chymical Principle or an Element, you'l not, I hope, think my wariness to be destitute either of Example, or else of Reason. For we see that the Chymists will not allow the Aristotelians that the Salt in Ashes ought to be called Earth, though the Saline and Terrestrial part symbolize in weight, in dryness, in fixness and fusibility, only because the one is sapid and dissoluble in Water, and the other not: Besides, we see that sapidness and volatility are wont to denominate the Chymists Mercury or Spirit; and yet how many Bodies, think you, may agree in those Qualities which may yet be of very differing natures, and disagree in qualities either more numerous, or more considerable, or both. For Page 243not only Spirit of Nitre, Aqua Fortis, Spirit of Salt, Spirit of Oyle of Vitriol, Spirit of Allome, Spirit of Vinager, and all Saline Liquors Distill'd from Animal Bodies, but all the Acetous Spirits of Woods freed from their Vinager; All these, I say, and many others must belong to the Chymists Mercury, though it appear not why some of them should more be comprehended under one denomination then the Chymists Sulphur, or Oyle should likewise be; for their Distill'd Oyles are also Fluid, Volatile, and Tastable, as well as their Mercury; Nor is it Necessary, that their Sulphur should be Unctuous or Dissoluble in Water, since they generally referr Spirit of Wine to Sulphurs, although that Spirit be not Unctuous, and will freely mingle with Water. So that bare Inflamability must constitute the Essence of the Chymists Sulphur; as uninflamablenesse joyned with any taste is enough to intitle a Distill'd Liquor to be their Mercury. Now since I can further observe to You, that Spirit of Nitre and Spirit of Hartshorne being pour'd together will boile Image 133 (page 244)and hisse and tosse up one another into the air, which the Chymists make signes of great Antipathy in the Natures of Bodies (as indeed these Spirits differ much both in Taste, Smell, and Operations;) Since I elsewhere tell you of my having made two sorts of Oyle out of the same mans blood, that would not mingle with one another; And since I might tell You Divers Examples I have met with, of the Contrariety of Bodies which according to the Chymists must be huddl'd up together under one Denomination; I leave you to Judge whether such a multitude of Substances as may agree in these sleight Qualities, and yet Disagree in Others more Considerable, are more worthy to be call'd by the Name of a Principle (which ought to be pure and homogeneous,) than to have appellations given them that may make them differ, in name too, from the bodies from which they so wildly differ in Nature. And hence also, by the bye, you may perceive that 'tis not unreasonable to distrust the Chymists way of Argumentation, when being unable to shew us that Page 245such a Liquor is (for Example) purely saline, they prove, that at least salt is much the predominant principle, because that the propos'd substance is strongly tasted, and all Tast proceeds from salt; whereas those Spirits, such as spirit of Tartar, spirit of Harts-horn, and the like, which are reckoned to be the Mercuries of the Bodies that afford them, have manifestly a strong and piercing tast, and so has (according to what I formerly noted) the spirit of Box &c. even after the acid Liquor that concurr'd to compose it has been separated from it. And indeed, if sapidness belong not to the spirit or Mercurial Principle of Vegitables and Animals: I scarce know how it will be discriminated from their phlegm, since by the absence of Inflamability it must be distinguish'd from their sulphur, which affords me another Example, to prove how unacurate the Chymical Doctrine is in our present Case; since not only the spirits of Vegitables and Animals, but their Oyles are very strongly tasted, as he that shall but wet his tongue with Chymical Oyle of Cinnamon, or of Cloves, or even of Turpentine, may quickly find, to his smart. And not only I Image 134 (page 246)never try'd any Chymical Oyles whose tast was not very manifest and strong; but a skilful and inquisitive person who made it his business by elaborate operations to depurate Chymical Oyles, and reduce them to an Elementary simplicity, Informes us, that he never was able to make them at all Tastless; whence I might inferr, that the proof Chymists confidently give us of a bodies being saline, is so far from demonstrating the Predominancy, that it does not clearly Evince so much as the presence of the saline Principle in it. But I will not (pursues Carneades) remind you, that the Volatile salt of Harts-horn, Amber, Blood, &c. are exceeding strongly scented, notwithstanding that most Chymists deduce Odours from Sulphur, and from them argue the Predominancy of that Principle in the Odorous body, because I must not so much as add any new Examples of the incompetency of this sort of Chymical arguments; since having already detain'd You but too long in those generals that appertain to my fourth consideration, 'tis time that I proceed to the particulars themselves, to which I thought fit they should be previous: Page 247 These Generals (continues Carneades) being thus premis'd, we might the better survey the Unlikeness that an attentive and unprepossess'd observer may take notice of in each sort of Bodies which the Chymists are wont to call the salts or sulphurs or Mercuries of the Concretes that yield Them, as if they had all a simplicity, and Identity of Nature: whereas salts if they were all Elementary would as little differ as do the Drops of pure and simple Water. 'Tis known that both Chymists and Physitians ascribe to the fixt salts of calcin'd Bodies the vertues of their concretes; and consequently very differing Operations. So we find the Alkali of Wormwood much commended in distempers of the stomach; that of Eyebright for those that have a weak sight; and that of Guaiacum (of which a great Quantity yields but a very little salt) is not only much commended in Venereal Diseases, but is believed to have a peculiar purgative vertue, which yet I have not had occasion to try. And though, I confess, I have long thought, that these Alkalizate salts are, for the most part, very neer of kin, and retain very little of the properties of Image 135 (page 248)the Concretes whence they were separated; Yet being minded to Observe watchfully whether I could meet with any Exceptions to this General Observation, I observ'd at the Glasse-house, that sometimes the Metal (as the Workmen call it) or Masse of colliquated Ingredients, which by Blowing they fashion into Vessels of divers shapes, did sometimes prove of a very differing colour, and a somewhat differing Texture, from what was usuall. And having enquired whether the cause of such Accidents might not be derived from the peculiar Nature of the fixt salt employ'd to bring the sand to fusion, I found that the knowingst Workmen imputed these Mis-adventures to the Ashes, of some certain kind of Wood, as having observ'd the ignobler kind of Glass I lately mention'd to be frequently produc'd when they had employ'd such sorts of Ashes which therefore they scruple to make use of, if they took notice of them beforehand. I remember also, that an Industrious Man of my acquaintance having bought a vast quantity of Tobacco stalks to make a fixt Salt with, I had the Curiosity to go see whether that Exotick Plant, which Page 249so much abounds in volatile salt, would afford a peculiar kind of Alcali; and I was pleas'd to find that in the Lixivium of it, it was not necessary, as is usual, to evaporate all the Liquor, that there might be obtain'd a Saline Calx, consisting like lime quench'd in the Air of a heap of little Corpuscles of unregarded shapes: but the fixt salt shot into figur'd Crystal, almost as Nitre or Sal-armoniack and other uncalcin'd salts are wont to do; And I further remember that I have observ'd in the fixt Salt of Urine, brought by depuration to be very white, a tast not so unlike to that of common salt, and very differing from the wonted caustick Lixiviate tast of other salts made by Incineration. But because the Instances I have alledg'd of the Difference of Alcalizate salt are but few, and therefore I am still inclin'd to think, that most Chymists and many Physitians do, inconsideratly enough and without Warrant from Experience, ascribe the Vertues of the Concretes expos'd to Calcination, to the salts obtain'd by it; I shall rather, to shew the Disparity of salts, mention in the first Place the apparent Difference betwixt the Vegetable fixt salts and the Image 136 (page 250)Animal Volatile ones: As (for Example) betwixt salt of Tartar, and salt of Harts-horn; whereof the former is so fixt that 'twill indure the brunt of a violent Fire, and stand in fusion like a Metal; whereas the other (besides that it has a differing tast and a very differing smell) is so far from being fixt, that it will fly away in a gentle heat as easily as spirit of Wine it self. And to this I shall add, in the next place, That even among the Volatile salts themselves, there is a considerable Difference, as appears by the distinct Properties of (for Instance) salt of Amber, salt of Urine, salt of Mans Skull, (so much extoll'd against the falling Sicknesse) and divers others which cannot escape an ordinary Observer. And this Diversity of Volatile salts I have observ'd to be somtimes Discernable even to the Eye, in their Figures. For the salt of Harts-horn I have observ'd to adhere to the Receiver in the forme almost of a Parallelipipedon; and of the Volatile salt of humane blood (long digested before distillation, with spirit of Wine) I can shew you store of graines of that Figure which Geometricians call a Rhombus; though I dare not Page 251undertake that the Figures of these or other Saline Crystals (if I may so call Them) will be alwaies the same, whatever degree of Fire have been employ'd to force them up, or how hastily soever they have been made to convene in the spirits or liquors, in the lower part of which I have usually observ'd them after a while to shoot. And although, as I lately told You, I seldom found any Difference, as to Medical Vertues, in the fixt Salts of Divers Vegetables; and accordingly I have suspected that most of these volatile Salts, having so great a Resemblance in smell, in tast, and fugitiveness, differ but little, if at all, in their Medicinal properties: As indeed I have found them generally to agree in divers of them (as in their being somewhat Diaphoretick and very Deopilative; Error vero per distillationem nobis monstrat etiam Spiritum salinum plane volatilem odore nequicquam ut nec gustu distinguibilem a spiritu �rinae; In eo tamen essentialiter diversum, quod spiritus talis cruoris curat Epilepsiam, non autem spiritus salis lotii. Helmont. Aura Vitalis. Yet I remember Helmont somewhere informes us, that there is this Difference betwixt the saline spirit of Urine and that of Mans blood, that the former will not cure the Epilepsy, Image 137 (page 252)but the Latter will. Of the Efficacy also of the Salt of Common Amber against the same Disease in Children, (for in Grown Persons it is not a specifick) I may elsewhere have an Occasion to Entertain You. And when I consider that to the obtaining of these Volatile Salts (especially that of Urine) there is not requisite such a Destructive Violence of the Fire, as there is to get those Salts that must be made by Incineration, I am the more invited to conclude, that they may differ from one another, and consequently recede from an Elementary Simplicity. And, if I could here shew You what Mr. Boyle has Observ'd, touching the Various Chymicall Distinctions of Salts; You would quickly discern, not only that Chymists do give themselves a strange Liberty to call Concretes Salts, that are according to their own Rules to be look'd upon as very Compounded Bodies; but that among those very Salts that seem Elementary, because produc'd upon the Anatomy of the Bodies that yield them, there is not only a visible Disparity, but, to speak in the common Language, Page 253a manifest Antipathy or Contrariety: As is evident in the Ebullition and hissing that is wont to ensue, when the Acid Spirit of Vitrioll, for Instance, is pour'd upon pot ashes, or Salt of Tartar. And I shall beg leave of this Gentleman, sayes Carneades, casting his Eyes on me, to let me observe to You out of some of his papers, particularly those wherein he treats of some Preparations of Urine, that not only one and the same body may have two Salts of a contrary Nature, as he exemplifies in the Spirit and Alkali of Nitre; but that from the same body there may without addition be obtain'd three differing and Visible Salts. For He Relates, that he observ'd in Urine, not only a Volatile and Crystalline Salt, and a fixt Salt, but likewise a kind of Sal Armoniack, or such a Salt as would sublime in the form of a salt, and therefore was not fixt, and yet was far from being so fugitive as the Volatile salt; from which it seem'd also otherwise to differ. I have indeed suspected that this may be a Sal Armoniack properly enough so call'd, as Compounded of the Volatile salt of Urine, and the fixt Image 138 (page 254)of the same Liquor, which, as I noted, is not unlike sea-salt; but that it self argues a manifest Difference betwixt the salts, since such a Volatile salt is not wont to Unite thus with an ordinary Alcali, but to fly away from it in the Heat. And on this occasion I remember that, to give some of my Friends an Ocular proof of the difference betwixt the fixt and Volatile salt (of the same Concrete) Wood, I devis'd the following Experiment. I took common Venetian sublimate, and dissolv'd as much of it as I well could in fair Water: then I took Wood Ashes, and pouring on them Warme Water, Dissolv'd their salt; and filtrating the Water, as soon as I found the Lixivium sufficiently sharp upon the tongue, I reserv'd it for use: Then on part of the former solution of sublimate dropping a little of this Dissolv'd Fixt salt of Wood, the Liquors presently turn'd of an Orange Colour; but upon the other part of the clear solution of sublimate putting some of the Volatile salt of Wood (which abounds in the spirit of soot) the Liquor immediately turn'd white, almost like Milke, and after Page 255a while let fall a white sediment, as the other Liquor did a Yellow one. To all this that I have said concerning the Difference of salts, Aliquando oleum Cinnamomi, &c. suo sali Alcali miscetur absque omni aqua, trium mensium Artificiosa occultaque circulatione, totum in salem volatilem commutatum est. Helmont. Tria Prima Chymicorum, &c. pag. 412. I might add what I Formerly told you, concerning the simple spirit of Box, and such like Woods, which differ much from the other salts hitherto mention'd, and yet would belong to the saline Principle, if Chymists did truly teach that all Tasts proceed from it. And I might also annex, what I noted to you out of Helmont concerning Bodies, which, though they consist in great part of Chymical Oyles, do yet appear but Volatile salts; But to insist on these things, were to repeat; and therefore I shall proceed. This Disparity is also highly eminent in the separated sulphurs or Chymical Oyles of things. For they contain so much of the scent, and tast, and vertues, of the Bodies whence they were drawn, that they seem to be but the Material Crasis (if I may so speak) of their Concretes. Thus the Oyles of Cinnamon, Image 139 (page 256)Cloves, Nutmegs and other spices, seem to be but the United Aromatick parts that did ennoble those Bodies. And 'tis a known thing, that Oyl of Cinnamon, and oyle of Cloves, (which I have likewise observ'd in the Oyles of several Woods) will sink to the Bottom of Water: whereas those of Nutmegs and divers other Vegetables will swim upon it. The Oyle (abusively call'd spirit) of Roses swims at the Top of the Water in the forme of a white butter, which I remember not to have observ'd in any other Oyle drawn in any Limbeck; yet there is a way (not here to be declar'd) by which I have seen it come over in the forme of other Aromatick Oyles, to the Delight and Wonder of those that beheld it. In Oyle of Anniseeds, which I drew both with, and without Fermentation, I observ'd the whole Body of the Oyle in a coole place to thicken into the Consistence and Appearance of white Butter, which with the least heat resum'd its Former Liquidness. In the Oyl of Olive drawn over in a Retort, I have likewise more then once seen a spontaneous Coagulation in the Page 257Receiver: And I have of it by me thus Congeal'd; which is of such a strangely Penetrating scent, as if 'twould Perforate the Noses that approach it. The like pungent Odour I also observ'd in the Distill'd Liquor of common sope, which forc'd over from Minium, lately afforded an oyle of a most admirable Penetrancy; And he must be a great stranger, both to the Writings and preparations of Chymists, that sees not in the Oyles they distill from Vegetables and Animals, a considerable and obvious Difference. Nay I shall venture to add, Eleutherius, (what perhaps you will think of kin to a Paradox) that divers times out of the same Animal or Vegetable, there may be extracted Oyles of Natures obviously differing. To which purpose I shall not insist on the swimming and sinking Oyles, which I have sometimes observ'd to float on, and subside under the spirit of Guajacum, and that of divers other Vegetables Distill'd with a strong and lasting Fire; Nor shall I insist on the observation elsewhere mention'd, of the divers and unminglable oyles afforded us by Humane Blood long fermented and Image 140 (page 258)Digested with spirit of Wine, because these kind of oyles may seem chiefly to differ in Consistence and Weight, being all of them high colour'd and adust. But the Experiment which I devis'd to make out this Difference of the oyles of the same Vegetable, ad Oculum, (as they speak) was this that followes. I took a pound of Annisseeds, and having grosly beaten them, caused them to be put into a very large glass Retort almost filled with fair Water; and placing this Retort in a sand Furnace, I caus'd a very Gentle heat to be administer'd during the first day, and a great part of the second, till the VVater was for the most part drawn off, and had brought over with it at least most of the Volatile and Aromatick Oyle of the seeds. And then encreasing the Fire, and changing the Receiver, I obtain'd besides an Empyreumatical Spirit, a quantity of adust oyle; whereof a little floated upon the Spirit, and the rest was more heavy, and not easily separable from it. And whereas these oyles were very dark, and smell'd (as Chymists speak) so strongly of the Fire, that their Odour Page 259did not betray from what Vegetables they had been forc'd; the other Aromatick Oyle was enrich'd with the genuine smell and tast of the Concrete; and spontaneously coagulating it self into white butter did manifest self to be the true Oyle of Annisseeds; which Concrete I therefore chose to employ about this Experiment, that the Difference of these Oyles might be more conspicuous then it would have been, had I instead of it destill'd another Vegetable. I had almost forgot to take notice, that there is another sort of Bodies, which though not obtain'd from Concretes by Distillation, many Chymists are wont to call their Sulphur; not only because such substances are, for the most part, high colour'd (whence they are also, and that more properly, called Tinctures) as dissolv'd Sulphurs are wont to be; but especially because they are, for the most part, abstracted and separated from the rest of the Masse by Spirit of Wine: which Liquor those men supposing to be Sulphureous, they conclude, that what it works upon, and abstracts, must be a Sulphur also. And upon this account they presume, that they can sequester the sulphur Image 141 (page 260)even of Minerals and Metalls; from which 'tis known that they cannot by Fire alone separate it. To all This I shall answer; That if these sequestred substances where indeed the sulphurs of the Bodies whence they are drawn, there would as well be a great Disparity betwixt Chymical Sulphurs obtain'd by Spirit of Wine, as I have already shewn there is betwixt those obtain'd by Distillation in the forme of Oyles: which will be evident from hence, that not to urge that themselves ascribe distinct vertues to Mineral Tinctures, extolling the Tincture of Gold against such and such Diseases; the Tincture of Antimony, or of its Glass, against others; and the Tincture of Emerauld against others; 'tis plain, that in Tinctures drawn from Vegetables, if the superfluous spirit of Wine be distill'd off, it leaves at the bottom that thicker substance which Chymists use to call the Extract of the Vegetable. And that these Extracts are endow'd with very differing Qualities according to the Nature of the Particular Bodies that afforded them (though I fear seldom with so much of the specifick vertues as is wont to be imagin'd) is freely confess'd Page 261both by Physitians and Chymists. But, Eleutherius, (sayes Carneades) we may here take Notice that the Chymists do as well in this case, as in many others, allow themselves a License to abuse Words: For not again to argue from the differing properties of Tinctures, that they are not exactly pure and Elementary Sulphurs; they would easily appear not to be so much as Sulphur's, although we should allow Chymical Oyles to deserve that Name. For however in some Mineral Tinctures the Natural fixtness of the extracted Body does not alwayes suffer it to be easily further resoluble into differing substances; Yet in very many extracts drawn from Vegetables, it may very easily be manifested that the spirit of Wine has not sequestred the sulphureous Ingredient from the saline and Mercurial ones; but has dissolv'd (for I take it to be a Solution) the finer Parts of the Concrete (without making any nice distinction of their being perfectly Sulphureous or not) and united it self with them into a kind of Magistery; which consequently must contain Ingredients or Parts of several sorts. For we see that the stones that are rich in vitriol, Image 142 (page 262)being often drench'd with rain-Water, the Liquor will then extract a sine and transparent substance coagulable into Vitriol; and yet though this Vitriol be readily dissoluble in Water, it is not a true Elementary Salt, but, as You know, a body resoluble into very differing Parts, whereof one (as I shall have occasion to tell You anon) is yet of a Metalline, and consequently not of an Elementary Nature. You may consider also, that common Sulphur is readily dissoluble in Oyle of Turpentine, though notwithstanding its Name it abounds as well, if not as much, in Salt as in true Sulphur; witness the great quantity of saline Liquor it affords being set to flame away under a glasse Bell. Nay I have, which perhaps You will think strange, with the same Oyle of Turpentine alone easily enough dissolv'd crude Antimony finely powder'd into a Blood-red Balsam, wherewith perhaps considerable things may be perform'd in Surgery. And if it were now Requisite, I could tell You of some other Bodies (such as Perhaps You would not suspect) that I have been able to work upon with certain Chymical Oyles. But instead of digressing further Page 263I shall make this use of the Example I have nam'd. That 'tis not unlikely, but that Spirit of Wine which by its pungent tast, and by some other Qualities that argue it better (especially its Reduciblenesse, according to Helmont, into Alcali, and Water,) seems to be as well of a Saline as of a Sulphureous Nature, may well be suppos'd Capable of Dissolving Substances That are not meerly Elementary sulphurs, though perhaps they may abound with Parts that are of kin thereunto. For I find that Spirit of Wine will dissolve Gumm Lacca, Benzoine, and the Resinous Parts of Jallap, and even of Guaiacum; whence we may well suspect that it may from Spices, Herbs, and other lesse compacted Vegetables, extract substances that are not perfect Sulphurs but mixt Bodies. And to put it past Dispute, there is many a Vulgar Extract drawn with Spirit of Wine, which committed to Distillation will afford such differing substances as will Loudly proclaim it to have been a very compounded Body. So that we may justly suspect, that even in Mineral Tinctures it will not alwaies follow, that because a red substance Image 143 (page 264)is drawn from the Concrete by spirit of Wine, that Substance is its true and Elementary Sulphur. And though some of these Extracts may perhaps be inflamable; Yet besides that others are not, and besides that their being reduc'd to such Minuteness of Parts may much facilitate their taking Fire; besides this, I say, We see that common Sulphur, common Oyle, Gumm Lac, and many Unctuous and Resinous Bodies, will flame well enough, though they be of very compounded natures: Nay Travellers of Unsuspected Credit assure Us, as a known thing, that in some Northern Countries where Firr trees and Pines abound, the poorer sort of Inhabitants use Long splinters of those Resinous Woods to burne instead of Candles. And as for the rednesse wont to be met with in such solutions, I could easily shew, that 'tis not necessary it should proceed from the Sulphur of the Concrete, Dissolv'd by the Spirit of Wine; if I had leasure to manifest how much Chymists are wont to delude themselves and others by the Ignorance of those other causes upon whose account spirit of Wine and other Menstruums may acquire Page 265a red or some other high colour. But to returne to our Chymical Oyles, supposing that they were exactly pure; Yet I hope they would be, as the best spirit of Wine is, but the more inflamable and deflagrable. And therefore since an Oyle can be by the Fire alone immediately turn'd into flame, which is something of a very differing Nature from it: I shall Demand how this Oyle can be a Primogeneal and Incorruptible Body, as most Chymists would have their Principles; Since it is further resoluble into flame, which whether or no it be a portion of the Element of Fire, as an Aristotelian would conclude, is certainly something of a very differing Nature from a Chymical Oyle, since it burnes, and shines, and mounts swiftly upwards; none of which a Chymical Oyle does, whilst it continues such. And if it should be Objected, that the Dissipated Parts of this flaming Oyle may be caught and collected again into Oyl or Sulphur; I shall demand, what Chymist appears to have ever done it; and without Examining whether it may not hence be as well said that sulphur is but compacted Fire, as that Fire is but Image 144 (page 266)diffus'd Sulphur, I shall leave you to consider whether it may not hence be argu'd, that neither Fire nor Sulphur are primitive and indestructible Bodies; and I shall further observe that, at least it will hence appear that a portion of matter may without being Compounded with new Ingredients, by having the Texture and Motion of its small parts chang'd, be easily, by the means of the Fire, endow'd with new Qualities, more differing from them it had before, then are those which suffice to discriminate the Chymists Principles from one another. We are next to Consider, whether in the Anatomy of mixt Bodies, that which Chymists call the Mercurial part of them be un-compounded, or no. But to tell You True, though Chymists do Unanimously affirm that their Resolutions discover a Principle, which they call Mercury, yet I find them to give of it Descriptions so Differing, and so Aenigmaticall, that I, who am not asham'd to confess that I cannot understand what is not sence, must acknowledge to you that I know not what to make of them. Paracelsus himself, and Page 267therefore, as you will easily believe, many of his Followers, does somewhere call that Mercury which ascends upon the burning of Wood, as the Peripateticks are wont to take the same smoke for Air; and so seems to define Mercury by Volatility, or (if I may coyne such a Word) Effumability. But since, in this Example, both Volatile Salt and Sulphur make part of the smoke, which does indeed consist also both of Phlegmatick and Terrene Corpuscles, this Notion is not to be admitted; And I find that the more sober Chymists themselves disavow it. Yet to shew you how little of clearness we are to expect in the accounts even of latter Spagyrists, be pleas'd to take notice, that Beguinus, even in his Tyrocinium Chymicum, written for the Instruction of Novices, when he comes to tell us what are meant by the Tria Prima, which for their being Principles ought to be defin'd the more accurately and plainly, gives us this Description of Mercury; Mercurius (sayes he) est liquor ille acidus, permeabilis, Chm. Tyrocin. lib. 1. Cap. 2. penetrabilis, aethereus, ac purissimus, a quo omnis Nutricatio, Sensus, Motus, Vires, Colores, Senectutisque Praeproperae retardatio. Image 145 (page 268)Which words are not so much a Definition of it, as an Encomium: and yet Quercetanus in his Description of the same Principle adds to these, divers other Epithets. But both of them, to skip very many other faults that may be found with their Metaphoricall Descriptions, speak incongruously to the Chymists own Principles. For if Mercury be an Acid Liquor, either Hermetical Philosophy must err in ascribing all Tasts to Salt, or else Mercury must not be a Principle, but Compounded of a Saline Ingredient and somewhat else. Libavius, though he find great fault with the obscurity of what the Chymists write concerning their Mercurial Principle, does yet but give us such a Negative Description of it, as Sennertus, how favourable soever to the Tria Prima, is not satisfi'd with. And this Sennertus Himself, though the Learnedst Champion for the Hypostatical Principles, does almost as frequently as justly complain of the unsatisfactoriness of what the Chymists teach concerning their Mercury; and yet he himself (but with his wonted modesty) Substitutes instead of the Description Page 269of Libavius, another, which many Readers, especially if they be not Peripateticks, will not know what to make of. For scarce telling us any more, then that in all bodies that which is found besides Salt and Sulphur, and the Elements, or, as they call them, Phlegm and Dead Earth, is that Spirit which in Aristotles Language may be call'd  in non-Latin alphabet 	. He sayes that which I confess is not at all satisfactory to me, who do not love to seem to acquiesce in any mans Mystical Doctrines, that I may be thought to understand them. If (sayes Eleutherius) I durst presume that the same thing would be thought clear by me, and those that are fond of such cloudy Expressions as You justly Tax the Chymists for, I should venture to offer to Consideration, whether or no, since the Mercurial Principle that arises from Distillation is unanimously asserted to be distinct from the salt and Sulphur of the same Concrete, that may not be call'd the Mercury of a Body, which though it ascend in Distillation, as do the Phlegme and Sulphur, is neither insipid like the former, nor inflamable Image 146 (page 270)like the latter. And therefore I would substitute to the too much abused Name of Mercury, the more clear and Familiar Appellation of Spirit, which is also now very much made use of even by the Chymists themselves, of our times, though they have not given us so Distinct an Explication, as were fit, of what may be call'd the Spirit of a mixt Body. I should not perhaps (sayes Carneades) much quarrel with your Notion of Mercury. But as for the Chymists, what they can mean, with congruity to their own Principles, by the Mercury of Animals and Vegetables, 'twill not be so easie to find out; for they ascribe Tasts only to the Saline Principle, and consequently would be much put to it to shew what Liquor it is, in the Resolution of Bodies, that not being insipid, for that they call Phlegme, neither is inflamable as Oyle or Sulphur, nor has any Tast; which according to them must proceed from a Mixture, at least, of Salt. And if we should take Spirit in the sence of the Word receiv'd among Modern Chymists and Physitians, for any Distill'd Liquor that Page 271is neither Phlegme nor oyle, the Appellation would yet appear Ambiguous enough. For, plainly, that which first ascends in the Distillation of Wine and Fermented Liquors, is generally as well by Chymists as others reputed a Spirit. And yet pure Spirit of Wine being wholly inflamable ought according to them to be reckon'd to the Sulphureous, not the Mercurial Principle. And among the other Liquors that go under the name of Spirits, there are divers which seem to belong to the family of Salts, such as are the Spirits of Nitre, Vitriol, Sea-Salt and others, and even the Spirit of Harts-horn, being, as I have try'd, in great part, if not totally reducible into Salt and Phlegme, may be suspected to be but a Volatile Salt disguis'd by the Phlegme mingl'd with it into the forme of a Liquor. However if this be a Spirit, it manifestly differs very much from that of Vinager, the Tast of the one being Acid, and the other Salt, and their Mixture in case they be very pure, sometimes occasioning an Effervescence like that of those Liquors the Chymists count most contrary to one another. And even among Image 147 (page 272)those Liquors that seem to have a better title then those hitherto mention'd, to the name of Spirits, there appears a sensible Diversity; For spirit of Oak, for instance, differs from that of Tartar, and this from that of Box, or of Guaiacum. And in short, even these spirits as well as other Distill'd Liquors manifest a great Disparity betwixt themselves, either in their Actions on our senses, or in their other operations. And (continues Carneades) besides this Disparity that is to be met with among those Liquors that the Modernes call spirits, & take for similar bodies, what I have formerly told you concerning the Spirit of Box-wood may let you see that some of those Liquors not only have qualities very differing from others, but may be further resolved into substances differing from one another. And since many moderne Chymists and other Naturalists are pleased to take the Mercurial spirit of Bodies for the same Principle, under differing names, I must invite you to observe, with me, the great difference that is conspicuous betwixt all the Vegetable and Animal spirits I have mention'd and running Page 273Mercury. I speak not of that which is commonly sold in shops that many of themselves will confesse to be a mixt Body; but of that which is separated from Metals, which by some Chymists that seem more Philosophers then the rest, and especially by the above mentioned Claveus, is (for distinction sake) called Mercurius Corporum. Now this Metalline Liquor being one of those three Principles of which Mineral Bodies are by Spagyrists affirmed to be compos'd and to be resoluble into them, the many notorious Differences betwixt them and the Mercuries, as They call Them, of Vegetables and Animals will allow me to inferr, either that Minerals and the other two sorts of Mixt Bodies consist not of the same Elements, or that those Principles whereinto Minerals are immediately resolved, which Chymists with great ostentation shew us as the true principles, of them, are but Secundary Principles, or Mixts of a peculiar sort, which must be themselves reduc'd to a very differing forme, to be of the same kind with Vegetable and Animal Liquors. But this is not all; for although I formerly Image 148 (page 274)told You how Little Credit there is to be given to the Chymical Processes commonly to be met with, of Extracting the Mercuries of Metals, Yet I will now add, that supposing that the more Judicious of Them do not untruly affirme that they have really drawn true and running Mercury from several Metals (which I wish they had cleerly taught Us how to do also,) yet it may be still doubted whether such extracted Mercuries do not as well differ from common Quicksilver, and from one another, as from the Mercuries of Vegetables and Animalls. Claveus, in his Apology, speaking of some experiments whereby Metalline Mercuries may be fixt into the nobler metals, Dixi autem de argento vivo a metallis prolicito, quod vulgare ob nimiam frigiditatem & humiditatem nimium concoctioni est contumax, nec ab auro solum alterato coerceri potest. Gast. Clave. in Apoll. adds, that he spake of the Mercuries drawn from metals; because common Quicksilver by reason of its excessive coldnesse and moisture is unfit for that particular kind of operation; for which though a few lines before he prescribes in general the Mercuries of Metalline Bodies, yet he chiefly commends that drawn by art from silver. Page 275And elsewhere, in the same Book, he tells us, that he himself tryed, that by bare coction the quicksilver of Tin or Pewter (argen um vivum ex stanno prolicitum) may by an efficient cause, as he speaks, be turn'd into pure Gold. And the Experienc'd Alexander van Suchten, somewhere tells us, that by a way he intimates may be made a Mercury of Copper, not of the Silver colour of other Mercuries, but green; to which I shall add, that an eminent person, whose name his travells and learned writings have made famous, lately assur'd me that he had more then once seen the Mercury of Lead (which what ever Authors promise, you will find it very difficult to make, at least in any considerable quantity) fixt into perfect Gold. And being by me demanded whether or no any other Mercury would not as well have been changed by the same Operations, he assured me of the Negative. And since I am fallen upon the mention of the Mercuries of metals, you will perhaps expect (Eleutherius!) that I should say something of their two other principles; but I must freely confess to you, that what Disparity there may be between Image 149 (page 276)the salts and sulphurs of Metals and other Menerals, I am not my self experienced enough in the separations and examens of them, to venture to determine: (for as for the salts of Metals, I formerly represented it as a thing much to be question'd, whether they have any at all:) And for the processes of separation I find in Authors, if they were (what many of them are not) successfully practicable, as I noted above, yet they are to be performed by the assistance of other bodies, so hardly, if upon any termes at all, separable from them, that it is very difficult to give the separated principles all their due, and no more. But the Sulphur of Antimony which is vehemently vomitive, and the strongly scented Anodyne Sulphur of Vitriol inclines me to think that not only Mineral Sulphurs differ from Vegetable ones, but also from one another, retaining much of the nature of their Concretes. The salts of metals, and of some sort of minerals, You will easily guesse by the Doubts I formerly express'd, whether metals have any salt at all, that I have not been so happy as yet to see, perhaps not for want of curiosity. But if Paracelsus did alwaies Page 277write so consentaneously to himself that his opinion were confidently to be collected from every place of his writings where he seems to expresse it, I might safely take upon me to tell you, that he both countenances in general what I have delivered in my Fourth main consideration, and in particular warrants me to suspect that there may be a difference in metalline and mineral Salts, as well as we find it in those of other bodies. For, Sulphur (sayes he) aliud in auro, aliud in argento, Paracel. de Mineral. Troct 1. pag. 141. aliud in ferro, aliud in plumbo, stanno, &c. sic aliud in Saphiro, aliud in Smaragdo, aliud in rubino, chrysolito, amethisto, magnete, &c. Item aliud in lapidibus, silice, salibus, fontibus, &c. nec vero tot sulphura tantum, sed & tot idem salia; sal aliud in metallis, aliud in gemmis, aliud in lapidibus, aliud in salibus, aliud in vitriolo, aliud in alumine: similis etiam Mercurii est ratio. Alius in Metallis, alius in Gemmis, &c. Ita ut unicuique speciei suus peculiaris Mercurius sit. Et tamen res saltem tres sunt; una essentia est sulphur; una est sal; una est Mercurius. Addo quod & specialius adhuc singula dividantur; aurum enim non unum, sed multiplex, ut et non unum pyrum, pomum, sed idem multiplex; totidem etiam Image 150 (page 278)sulphura auri, salia auri, mercurii auri; idem competit etiam metallis & gemmis; ut quot saphyri praestantiores, laeviores, &c. tot etiam saphyrica sulphura, saphyrica salia, suphyrici Mercurii, &c. Idem verum etiam est de turconibus & gemmis aliis universis. From which passage (Eleutherius) I suppose you will think I might without rashness conclude, either that my opinion is favoured by that of Paracelsus, or that Paracelsus his opinion was not alwaies the same. But because in divers other places of his writings he seems to talk at a differing rate of the three Principles and the four Elements, I shall content my self to inferr from the alledg'd passage, that if his doctrine be not consistent with that Part of mine which it is brought to countenance, it is very difficult to know what his opinion concerning salt, sulphur and mercury, was; and that consequently we had reason about the beginning of our conferences, to decline taking upon us, either to examine or oppose it. I know not whether I should on this occasion add, that those very bodies the Chymists call Phlegme and Earth do yet recede from an Elementary simplicity. Page 279That common Earth and Water frequently do so, notwithstanding the received contrary opinion, is not deny'd by the more wary of the moderne Peripateticks themselves: and certainly, most Earths are much lesse simple bodies then is commonly imagined even by Chymists, who do not so consideratly to prescribe and employ Earths Promiscuously in those distillations that require the mixture of some caput mortuum, to hinder the flowing together of the matter, and to retain its grosser parts. For I have found some Earths to yield by distillation a Liquor very far from being inodorous or insipid; and 'tis a known observation, that most kinds of fat Earth kept cover'd from the rain, and hindred from spending themselves in the production of vegetables, will in time become impregnated with Salt-Petre. But I must remember that the Water and Earths I ought here to speak of, are such as are separated from mixt Bodies by the fire; and therefore to restrain my Discourse to such, I shall tell you, That we see the Phlegme of Vitriol (for instance) is a very effectual remedie against burnes; and I know a very Famous Image 151 (page 280)and experienc'd Physitian, whose unsuspected secret (himself confess'd to me) it is, for the discussing of hard and Obstinate Tumours. The Phlegme of Vinager, though drawn exceeding leasurly in a digesting Furnace, I have purposely made tryall of; and sometimes found it able to draw, though slowly, a saccharine sweetness out of Lead; and as I remember by long Digestion, I dissolv'd Corpals in it. The Phlegme of the sugar of Saturne is said to have very peculiar properties. Divers Eminent Chymists teach, that it will dissolve Pearls, which being precipitated by the spirit of the same concrete are thereby (as they say) rendred volatile; which has been confirmed to me, upon his own observation, by a person of great veracity. The Phlegme of Wine, and indeed divers other Liquors that are indiscriminately condemnd to be cast away as phlegm, are endow'd with qualities that make them differ both from meer water, and from each other; and whereas the Chymists are pleas'd to call the caput mortuum of what they have distill'd (after they have by affusion of water drawn away its salt) terra damnata, or Earth, it may be doubted whether or Page 281no those earths are all of them perfectly alike: and it is scarce to be doubted, but that there are some of them which remain yet unreduc'd to an Elementary nature. The ashes of wood depriv'd of all the salt, and bone-Ashes, or calcin'd Hartshorn, which Refiners choose to make Tests of, as freest from Salt, seem unlike: and he that shall compare either of these insipid ashes to Lime, and much more to the calx of Talk (though by the affusion of water they be exquisitely dulcify'd) will perhaps see cause to think them things of a somewhat differing nature. And it is evident in Colcothar that the exactest calcination, follow'd by an exquisite dulcification, does not alwaies reduce the remaining body into elementary earth; for after the salt or Vitriol (if the Calcination have been too faint) is drawn out of the Colcothar, the residue is not earth, but a mixt body, rich in Medical vertues (as experience has inform'd me) and which Angelus Sala affirmes to be partly reducible into malleable Copper; which I judge very probable: for though when I was making Experiments upon Colcothar, I was destitute of a Furnace capable of giving a heat intense Enough to bring such a Image 152 (page 282)Calx to Fusion; yet having conjectur'd that if Colcothar abounded with that Metal, Aqua Fortis would find it out there, I put some dulcifi'd Colcothar into that Menstruum, and found the Liquor, according to my Expectation, presently Colour'd as Highly as if it had been an Ordinary Solution of Copper.   Page 283 THE SCEPTICAL CHYMIST. The Fifth Part. HEre Carneades making a pause, I must not deny (sayes his Friend to him) that I think You have sufficiently prov'd that these distinct Substances which Chymists are wont to obtain from Mixt Bodies, by their Vulgar Destillation, are not pure and simple enough to deserve, in Rigour of speaking, the Name of Elements, or Principles. But I suppose You have heard, that there are some Modern Spagyrists, who give out that they can by further and more Skilfull Purifications, so reduce the separated Ingredients of Mixt Bodies to an Elementary simplicity, That Image 153 (page 284)the Oyles (for Instance) extracted from all Mixts shall as perfectly resemble one another, as the Drops of Water do. If you remember (replies Carneades) that at the Beginning of our Conference with Philoponus, I declar'd to him before the rest of the Company, that I would not engage my self at present to do any more then examine the usual proofs alledg'd by Chymists, for the Vulgar doctrine of their three Hypostatical Principles; You will easily perceive that I am not oblig'd to make answer to what you newly propos'd; and that it rather grants, then disproves what I have been contending for: Since by pretending to make so great a change in the reputed Principles that Destillation affords the common Spagyrists, 'tis plainly enough presuppos'd, that before such Artificial Depurations be made, the Substances to be made more simple were not yet simple enough to be look'd upon as Elementary; Wherefore in case the Artists you speak of could perform what they give out they can, yet I should not need to be asham'd of having question'd the Vulgar Opinion Page 285touching the tria Prima. And as to the thing it self, I shall freely acknowledge to you, that I love not to be forward in determining things to be impossible, till I know and have consider'd the means by which they are propos'd to be effected. And therefore I shall not peremptorily deny either the possibility of what these Artists promise, or my Assent to any just Inference; however destructive to my Conjectures, that may be drawn from their performances. But give me leave to tell you withall, that because such promises are wont (as Experience has more then once inform'd me) to be much more easily made, then made good by Chymists, I must withhold my Beliefe from their assertions, till their Experiments exact it; and must not be so easie as to expect before hand, an unlikely thing upon no stronger Inducements then are yet given me: Besides that I have not yet found by what I have heard of these Artists, that though they pretend to bring the several Substances into which the Fire has divided the Concrete, to an exquisite simplicity, They pretend also to be able by the Fire to divide all Concretes, Image 154 (page 286)Minerals, and others, into the same number of Distinct Substances. And in the mean time I must think it improbable, that they can either truly separate as many differing Bodies from Gold (for Instance) or Osteocolla, as we can do from Wine, or Vitriol; or that the Mercury (for Example) of Gold or Saturn would be perfectly of the same Nature with that of Hartshorn; and that the sulphur of Antimony would be but Numerically different from the Distill'd butter or oyle of Roses. But suppose (sayes Eleutherius) that you should meet with Chymists, who would allow you to take in Earth and Water into the number of the principles of Mixt Bodies; and being also content to change the Ambiguous Name of Mercury for that more intelligible one of spirit, should consequently make the principles of Compound Bodies to be Five; would you not think it something hard to reject so plausible an Opinion, only because the Five substances into which the Fire divides mixt Bodies are not exactly pure, and Homogeneous? For my part Page 287(Continues Carneades) I cannot but think it somewhat strange, in case this Opinion be not true, that it should fall out so luckily, that so great a Variety of Bodies should be Analyz'd by the Fire into just five Distinct substances; which so little differing from the Bodies that bear those names, may so Plausibly be call'd Oyle, Spirit, Salt, Water, and Earth. The Opinion You now propose (answers Carneades) being another then that I was engag'd to examine, it is not requisite for me to Debate it at present; nor should I have leisure to do it thorowly. Wherefore I shall only tell you in General, that though I think this Opinion in some respects more defensible then that of the Vulgar Chymists; yet you may easily enough learn from the past Discourse what may be thought of it: Since many of the Objections made against the Vulgar Doctrine of the Chymists seem, without much alteration, employable against this Hypothesis also. For, besides that this Doctrine does as well as the other take it for granted, (what is not easie to be prov'd) that the Fire is the true and Adequate Analyzer Image 155 (page 288)of Bodies, and that all the Distinct substances obtainable from a mixt Body by the Fire, were so pre-existent in it, that they were but extricated from each other by the Analysis; Besides that this Opinion, too, ascribe to the Productions of the Fire an Elementary simplicity, which I have shewn not to belong to them; and besides that this Doctrine is lyable to some of the other Difficulties, wherewith That of the Tria Prima is incumber'd; Besides all this, I say, this quinary number of Elements, (if you pardon the Expression) ought at least to have been restrain'd to the Generality of Animal and Vegetable Bodies, since not only among these there are some Bodies (as I formerly argu'd) which, for ought has yet been made to appear, do consist, either of fewer or more similar substances then precisely Five. But in the Mineral Kingdom, there is scarce one Concrete that has been evinc'd to be adequatly divisible into such five Principles or Elements, and neither more nor less, as this Opinion would have every mixt Body to consist of. And this very thing (continues Carneades) Page 289may serve to take away or lessen your Wonder, that just so many Bodies as five should be found upon the Resolution of Concretes. For since we find not that the fire can make any such Analysis (into five Elements) of Metals and other Mineral Bodies, whose Texture is more strong and permanent, it remains that the Five Substances under consideration be Obtain'd from Vegetable and Animal Bodies, which (probably by reason of their looser Contexture) are capable of being Distill'd. And as to such Bodies, 'tis natural enough, that, whether we suppose that there are, or are not, precisely five Elements, there should ordinarily occurr in the Dissipated parts a five Fold Diversity of Scheme (if I may so speak.) For if the Parts do not remain all fix'd, as in Gold, Calcin'd Talck, &c. nor all ascend, as in the Sublimation of Brimstone, Camphire, &c. but after their Dissipation do associate themselves into new Schemes of Matter; it is very likely, that they will by the Fire be divided into fix'd and Volatile (I mean, in Reference to that degree of heat by which they are destill'd) and those Volatile Image 156 (page 290)parts will, for the most part, ascend either in a dry forme, which Chymists are pleas'd to call, if they be Tastless, Flowers; if Sapid, Volatile Salt; or in a Liquid Forme. And this Liquor must be either inflamable, and so pass for oyl, or not inflamable, and yet subtile and pungent, which may be call'd Spirit; or else strengthless or insipid, which may be nam'd Phlegme, or Water. And as for the fixt part, or Caput Mortuum, it will most commonly consist of Corpuscles, partly Soluble in Water, or Sapid, (especially if the Saline parts were not so Volatile, as to fly away before) which make up its fixt salt; and partly insoluble and insipid, which therefore seems to challenge the name of Earth. But although upon this ground one might easily enough have foretold, that the differing substances obtain'd from a perfectly mixt Body by the Fire would for the most part be reducible to the five newly mentioned States of Matter; yet it will not presently follow, that these five Distinct substances were simple and primogeneal bodies, so preexistent in the Concrete that the fire does but take them asunder. Besides Page 291that it does not appear, that all Mixt Bodies, (witness, Gold, Silver, Mercury, &c.) Nay nor perhaps all Vegetables, which may appear by what we said above of Camphire, Benzoin, &c. are resoluble by Fire into just such differing Schemes of Matter. Nor will the Experiments formerly alledg'd permit us to look upon these separated Substances as Elementary, or uncompounded. Neither will it be a sufficient Argument of their being Bodies that deserve the Names which Chymists are pleas'd to give them, that they have an Analogy in point of Consistence, or either Volatility or Fixtness, or else some other obvious Quality, with the suppos'd Principles, whose names are ascrib'd to them. For, as I told you above, notwithstanding this Resemblance in some one Quality, there may be such a Disparity in others, as may be more fit to give them Differing Appellations, then the Resemblance is to give them one and the same. And indeed it seems but somewhat a gross Way of judging of the Nature of Bodies, to conclude without Scruple, that those must be of the same Image 157 (page 292)Nature that agree in some such General Quality, as Fluidity, Dryness, Volatility, and the like: since each of those Qualities, or States of Matter, may Comprehend a great Variety of Bodies, otherwise of a very differing Nature; as we may see in the Calxes of Gold, of Vitriol, and of Venetian Talck, compar'd with common Ashes, which yet are very dry, and fix'd by the vehemence of the Fire, as well as they. And as we may likewise gather from what I have formerly Observ'd, touching the Spirit of Box-Wood, which though a Volatile, Sapid, and not inflamable Liquor, as well as the Spirits of Harts-horn, of Blood and others, (and therefore has been hitherto call'd, the Spirit, and esteem'd for one of the Principles of the Wood that affords it;) may yet, as I told You, be subdivided into two Liquors, differing from one another, and one of them at least, from the Generality of other Chymical Spirits. But you may your self, if you please, (pursues Carneades) accommodate to the Hypothesis you propos'd what other particulars you shall think applicable to it, Page 293in the foregoing Discourse. For I think it unseasonable for me to meddle now any further with a Controversie, which since it does not now belong to me, Leaves me at Liberty to Take my Own time to Declare my Self about it. Eleutherius perceiving that Carneades was somewhat unwilling to spend any more time upon the debate of this Opinion, and having perhaps some thoughts of taking hence a Rise to make him Discourse it more fully another time, thought not fit as then to make any further mention to him of the propos'd opinion, but told him; I presume I need not mind you, Carneades, That both the Patrons of the ternary number of Principles, and those that would have five Elements, endeavour to back their experiments with a specious Reason or two; and especially some of those Embracers of the Opinion last nam'd (whom I have convers'd with, and found them Learned men) assigne this Reason of the necessity of five distinct Elements; that otherwise mixt Bodies could not be so compounded and temper'd as to obtain a due consistence Image 158 (page 294)and competent Duration. For Salt (say they) is the Basis of Solidity; and Permanency in Compound Bodies, without which the other four Elements might indeed be variously and loosly blended together, but would remain incompacted; but that Salt might be dissolv'd into minute Parts, and convey'd to the other Substances to be compacted by it, and with it, there is a Necessity of Water. And that the mixture may not be too hard and brittle, a Sulphureous or Oyly Principle must intervene to make the mass more tenacious; to this a Mercurial spirit must be superadded; which by its activity may for a while premeate, and as it were leaven the whole Mass, and thereby promote the more exquisite mixture and incorporation of the Ingredients. To all which (lastly) a portion of Earth must be added, which by its drinesse and poracity may soak up part of that water wherein the Salt was dissolv'd, and eminently concurr with the other ingredients to give the whole body the requisite consistence. I perceive (sayes Carneades smiling) that if it be true, as 'twas lately rooted from the Proverb, That good Wits have Page 295bad Memories, You have that Title, as well as a better, to a place among the good Wits. For you have already more then once forgot, that I declar'd to you that I would at this Conference Examine only the Experiments of my Adversaries, not their Speculative Reasons. Yet 'tis not (Subjoynes Carneades) for fear of medling with the Argument you have propos'd, that I decline the examining it at present. For if when we are more at leasure, you shall have a mind that we may Solemnly consider of it together; I am confident we shall scarce find it insoluble. And in the mean time we may observe, that such a way of Arguing may, it seems, be speciously accommodated to differing Hypotheses. For I find that Beguinus, and other Assertors of the Tria Prima, pretend to make out by such a way, the requisiteness of their Salt, Sulphur and Mercury, to constitute mixt Bodies, without taking notice of any necessity of an Addition of Water and Earth. And indeed neither sort of Chymists seem to have duly consider'd how great Variety there is in the Textures and Image 159 (page 296)Consistences of Compound Bodie; sand how little the consistence and Duration of many of them seem to accommodate and be explicable by the propos'd Notion. And not to mention those almost incorruptible Substances obtainable by the Fire, which I have prov'd to be somewhat compounded, and which the Chymists will readily grant not to be perfectly mixt Bodies: (Not to mention these, I say) If you will but recall to mind some of those Experiments, whereby I shew'd You that out of common Water only mixt Bodies (and even living ones) of very differing consistences, and resoluble by Fire into as many Principles as other bodies acknowledg'd to be perfectly mixt; if you do this, I say, you will not, I suppose, be averse from beleeving, that Nature by a convenient disposition of the minute parts of a portion of matter may contrive bodies durable enough, and of this, or that, or the other Consistence, without being oblig'd to make use of all, much less of any Determinate quantity of each of the five Elements, or of the three Principles to compound such bodies of. And I have (pursues Carneades) Page 297something wonder'd, Chymists should not consider, that there is scarce any body in Nature so permanent and indissoluble as Glass; which yet themselves teach us may be made of bare Ashes, brought to fusion by the meer Violence of the Fire; so that, since Ashes are granted to consist but of pure Salt and simple Earth, sequestred from all the other Principles or Elements, they must acknowledge, That even Art it self can of two Elements only, or, if you please, one Principle and one Element, compound a Body more durable then almost any in the World. Which being undeniable, how will they prove that Nature cannot compound Mixt Bodies, and even durable Ones, under all the five Elements or material Principles. But to insist any longer on this Occasional Disquisition, Touching their Opinion that would Establish five Elements, were to remember as little as You did before, that the Debate of this matter is no part of my first undertaking; and consequently, that I have already spent time enough in what I look back upon but as a digression, or at best an Excursion. Image 160 (page 298) And thus, Eleutherius, (sayes Carneades) having at length gone through the four Considerations I propos'd to Discourse unto you, I hold it not unfit, for fear my having insisted so long on each of them may have made you forget their Series, briefly to repeat them by telling you, that Since, in the first place, it may justly be doubted whether or no the Fire be, as Chymists suppose it, the genuine and Universal Resolver of mixt Bodies; Since we may doubt, in the next place, whether or no all the Distinct Substances that may be obtain'd from a mixt body by the Fire were pre-existent there in the formes in which they were separated from it; Since also, though we should grant the Substances separable from mixt Bodies by the fire to have been their component Ingredients, yet the Number of such substances does not appear the same in all mixt Bodies; some of them being Resoluble into more differing substances than three, and Others not being Resoluble into so many as three. And Since, Lastly, those very substances that are thus separated are not for the Page 299most part pure and Elementary bodies, but new kinds of mixts; Since, I say, these things are so, I hope you will allow me to inferr, that the Vulgar Experiments (I might perchance have Added, the Arguments too) wont to be Alledg'd by Chymists to prove, that their three Hypostatical Principles do adequately compose all mixt Bodies, are not so demonstrative as to reduce a wary Person to acquiesce in their Doctrine, which, till they Explain and prove it better, will by its perplexing darkness be more apt to puzzle then satisfy considering men, and will to them appear incumbred with no small Difficulties. And from what has been hitherto deduc'd (continues Carneades) we may Learn, what to Judge of the common Practice of those Chymists, who because they have found that Diverse compound Bodies (for it will not hold in All) can be resolv'd into, or rather can be brought to afford two or three differing Substances more then the Soot and Ashes, whereinto the naked fire commonly divides them in our Chymnies, cry up their own Sect for the Invention of a New Philosophy, some of them, as Helmont, &c. styling Image 161 (page 300)themselves Philosophers by the Fire; and the most part not only ascribing, but as far as in them lies, engrossing to those of their Sect the Title of PHILOSOPHERS. But alas, how narrow is this Philosophy, that reaches but to some of those compound Bodies, which we find but upon, or in the crust or outside of our terrestrial Globe, which is it self but a point in comparison of the vast extended Universe, of whose other and greater parts the Doctrine of the Tria Prima does not give us an Account! For what does it teach us, either of the Nature of the Sun, which Astronomers affirme to be eightscore and odd times bigger then the whole Earth? or of that of those numerous sixt Starrs, which, for ought we know, would very few, if any of them, appear inferiour in bulke and brightness to the Sun, if they were as neer us as He? What does the knowing that Salt, sulphur and Mercury, are the Principles of Mixt Bodies, informe us of the Nature of that vast, fluid, and Aetherial Substance, that seemes to make up the interstellar, and consequently much the greatest part of the World? for as for Page 301the opinion commonly ascrib'd to Paracelsus, as if he would have not only the four Peripatetick Elements, but even the Celestial parts of the Universe to consist of his three Principles, since the modern Chymists themselves have not thought so groundless a conceit worth their owning, I shall not think it Worth my confuting. But I should perchance forgive the Hypothesis I have been all this while examining, if, though it reaches but to a very little part of the World, it did at least give us a satisfactory account of those things to which 'tis said to reach. But I find not, that it gives us any other then a very imperfect information even about mixt Bodies themselves: For how will the knowledge of the Tria Prima discover to us the Reason, why the Loadstone drawes a Needle and disposes it to respect the Poles, and yet seldom precisely points at them? how will this Hypothesis teach Us how a Chick is formed in the Egge, or how the Seminal Principles of Mint, Pompions, and other Vegitables, that I mention'd to You above, can fashion Water into Various Plants, each of them endow'd with its peculiar Image 162 (page 302)and determinate shape, and with divers specifick and discriminating Qualities? How does this Hypothesis shew us, how much Salt, how much Sulphur, and how much Mereury must be taken to make a Chick or a Pompion? and if We know that, what Principle is it, that manages these Ingredients, and contrives (for instance) such Liquors as the White and Yelk of an Egge into such a variety of Textures as is requisite to fashion the Bones, Veines, Arteries, Nerves, Tendons, Feathers, Blood, and other parts of a Chick; and not only to fashion each Limbe, but to connect them altogether, after that manner that is most congruous to the perfection of the Animal which is to Consist of Them? For to say, that some more fine and subtile part of either or all the Hypostatical Principles is the Director in all this business, and the Architect of all this Elaborate structure, is to give one occasion to demand again, what proportion and way of mixture of the Tria Prima afforded this Architectonick Spirit, and what Agent made so skilful and happy a mixture? And the Answer to this Question, if the Chymists will keep themselves Page 303within their three Principles, will be lyable to the same Inconvenience, that the Answer to the former was. And if it were not to intrench upon the Theame of a Friend of ours here present, I could easily prosecute the Imperfections of the Vulgar Chymists Philosophy, and shew you, that by going about to explicate by their three Principles, I say not, all the abstruse Properties of mixt Bodies, but even such Obvious and more familiar Phaenomena as Fluidity and Firmness, The Colours and Figures of Stones, Minerals, and other compound Bodies, The Nutrition of either Plants or Animals, the Gravity of Gold or Quicksilver compar'd with Wine or Spirit of Wine; By attempting, I say, to render a reason of these (to omit a thousand others as difficult to account for) from any proportion of the three simple Ingredients, Chymists will be much more likely to discredit themselves and their Hypothesis, then satisfy an intelligent Inquirer after Truth. But (interposes Eleutherus) This Objection seems no more then may be made against the four Peripatetick Elements. And indeed almost against any other Hypothesis, Image 163 (page 304)that pretends by any Determinate Number of Material Ingredients to render a reason of the Phaenomena of Nature. And as for the use of the Chymical Doctrine of the three Principles, I suppose you need not be told by me, Senn. de Cons. & Dissen. p. 165, that The great Champion of it, The Learned Sennertus, assignes this noble use of the Tria Prima, That from Them, as the neerest and most Proper Principles, may be Deduc'd and Demonstrated the Properties which are in Mixt Bodies, and which cannot be Proximately (as They speak) deduc'd from the Elements. And This, sayes he, is chiefly Apparent, when we Inquire into the Properties and Faculties of Medecines. And I know (continues Eleutherius) That the Person You have assum'd, of an Opponent of the Hermetick Doctrine, will not so far prevaile against your Native and wonted Equity, as To keep You from acknowledging that Philosophy is much beholden to the Notions and Discoveries of Chymists. If the Chymists You speak of (Replyes Carneades) had been so modest, or so Discreet, as to propose their Opinion Page 305of the Tria Prima, but as a Notion useful among Others, to increase Humane knowledge, they had deserv'd more of our thanks; and less of our Opposition; but since the Thing that they pretend is not so much to contribute a Notion toward the Improvement of Philosophy, as to make this Notion attended by a few lesse considerable ones) pass for a New Philosophy it self. Nay, since they boast so much of this phancie of theirs, that the famous Quercetanus scruples not to write, that if his most certain Doctrine of the three Principles were sufficiently Learned, Examin'd, and Cultivated, it would easily Dispel all the Darkness that benights our minds, and bring in a Clear Light, that would remove all Difficulties. This School affording Theorems and Axiomes irrefragable, and to be admitted without Dispute by impartial Judges; and so useful withal, as to exempt us from the necessity of having recourse, for want of the knowledg of causes, to that Sanctuary of the igorant, Occult Qualities; since, I say, this Domestick Notion of the Chymists is so much overvalued by them, I cannot think it unfit, they should be made Image 164 (page 306)sensible of their mistake; and be admonish'd to take in more fruitful and comprehensive Principles, if they mean to give us an account of the Phaenomena of Nature; and not confine themselves and (as far as they can) others to such narrow Principles, as I fear will scarce inable them to give an account (I mean an intelligible one) of the tenth part (I say not) of all the Phaenomena of Nature; but even of all such as by the Leucippian or some of the other sorts of Principles may be plausibly enough explicated. And though I be not unwilling to grant, that the incompetency I impute to the Chymical Hypothesis is but the same which may be Objected against that of the four Elements, and divers other Doctrines that have been maintain'd by Learnedmen; yet since 'tis the Chymical Hypothesis only which I am now examining, I see not why, if what I impute to it be a real inconvenience, either it should cease to be so, or I should scruple to object it, because other Theories are lyable thereunto, as well as the Hermetical. For I know not why a Truth should be thought lesse a Truth for the being fit to overthrow variety of Errors. Page 307 I am oblig'd to You (continues Carneades, a little smiling) for the favourable Opinion You are pleas'd to express of my Equity, if there be no design in it. But I need not be tempted by an Artifice, or invited by a Complement, to acknowledge the great service that the Labours of Chymists have done the Lovers of useful Learning; nor even on this occasion shall their Arrogance hinder my Gratitude. But since we are as well examining to the truth of their Doctrine as the merit of their industry, I must in order to the investigation of the first, continue a reply, to talk at the rate of the part I have assum'd; And tell you, that when I acknowledg the usefulness of the Labours of Spagyrists to Natural Philosophy, I do it upon the score of their experiments, not upon that of Their Speculations; for it seems to me, that their Writings, as their Furnaces, afford as well smoke as light; and do little lesse obscure some subjects, then they illustrate others. And though I am unwilling to deny, that 'tis difficult for a man to be an Accomplisht Naturalist, that is a stranger to Chymistry, yet I look upon the common Operations and practices Image 165 (page 308)of Chymists, almost as I do on the Letters of the Alphabet, without whose knowledge 'tis very hard for a man to become a Philosopher; and yet that knowledge is very far from being sufficient to make him One. But (sayes Carneades, resuming a more serious Look) to consider a little more particularly what you alledg in favour of the Chymical Doctrine of the Tria Prima, though I shall readily acknowledge it not to be unuseful, and that the Divisers and Embracers of it have done the Common-Wealth of Learning some service, by helping to destroy that excessive esteem, or rather veneration, wherewith the Doctrine of the four Elements was almost as generally as undeservedly entertain'd; yet what has been alledg'd concerning the usefulness of the Tria Prima, seems to me liable to no contemptible Difficulties. And first, as for the very way of Probation, which the more Learned and more Sober Champions of the Chymical cause employ to evince the Chymical Principles in Mixt Bodies, it seems to me to be farr enough from being convincing. This grand and leading Argument, your Page 309Sennertus Himself, who layes Great weight upon it, and tells us, that the most Learned Philosophers employ this way of Reasoning to prove the most important things, proposes thus: Ubicunque (sayes he) pluribus eaedem affectiones & qualitates insunt, per commune quoddam Principium insint necesse est, sicut omnia sunt Gravia propter terram, calida propter Ignem. At Colores, Odores, Sapores, esse  in non-Latin alphabet 	, & similia alia, mineralibus, Metallis, Gemmis, Lapidibus, Plantis, Animalibus insunt. Ergo per commune aliquod principium, & subiectum, insunt. At tale principium non sunt Elementa. Nullam enim habent ad tales qualitates producendas potentiam. Ergo alia principia, unde fluant, inquirenda sunt. In the Recital of this Argument, (sayes Carneades) I therefore thought fit to retain the Language wherein the Author proposes it, that I might also retain the propriety of some Latine Termes, to which I do not readily remember any that fully answer in English. But as for the Argumentation it self, 'tis built upon a precarious supposition, that seems to me neither Demonstrable nor true; for, how does it Image 166 (page 310)appear, that where the same Quality is to be met with in many Bodies, it must belong to them upon the Account of some one Body whereof they all partake? (For that the Major of our Authors Argument is to be Understood of the Material Ingredients of bodies, appears by the Instances of Earth and Fire he annexes to explain it.) For to begin with that very Example which he is pleas'd to alledge for himself; how can he prove, that the Gravity of all Bodies proceeds from what they participate of the Element of Earth? Since we see, that not only common Water, but the more pure Distill'd Rain Water is heavy; and Quicksilver is much heavier than Earth it self; though none of my Adversaries has yet prov'd, that it contains any of that Element. And I the Rather make use of this Example of Quicksilver, because I see not how the Assertors of the Elements will give any better Account of it then the Chymists. For if it be demanded how it comes to be Fluid, they will answer, that it participates much of the Nature of Water. And indeed, according to them, Water Page 311may be the Predominant Element in it, since we see, that several Bodies which by Distillation afford Liquors that weigh more then their Caput Mortuum do not yet consist of Liquor enough to be Fluid. Yet if it be demanded how Quicksilver comes to be so heavy, then 'tis reply'd, that 'tis by reason of the Earth that abounds in it; but since, according to them, it must consist also of air, and partly of Fire, which they affirm to be light Elements, how comes it that it should be so much heavier then Earth of the same bulk, though to fill up the porosities and other Cavities it be made up into a mass or paste with Water, which it self they allow to be a heavy Element. But to returne to our Spagyrists, we see that Chymical Oyles and fixt Salts, though never so exquisitely purify'd and freed from terrestrial parts, do yet remain ponderous enough. And Experience has inform'd me, that a pound, for instance, of some of the heaviest Woods, as Guajacum that will sink in Water, being burnt to Ashes will yield a much less weight of them (whereof I found but a small part to be Alcalyzate) then much lighter Image 167 (page 312)Vegetables: As also that the black Charcoal of it will not sink as did the wood, but swim; which argues that the Differing Gravity of Bodies proceeds chiefly from their particular Texture, as is manifest in Gold, the closest and Compactest of Bodies, which is many times heavier then we can possibly make any parcell of Earth of the same Bulk. I will not examine, what may be argu'd touching the Gravity or Quality Analagous thereunto, of even Celestial bodies, from the motion of the spots about the Sun, d from the appearing equality of the suppos'd Seas in the Moon; nor consider how little those Phaemonea would agree with what Sennertus presumes concerning Gravity. But further to invalidate his supposition, I shall demand, upon what Chymical Principle Fluidity depends? And yet Fluidity is, two or three perhaps excepted, the most diffused quality of the universe, and far more General then almost any other of those that are to be met with in any of the Chymicall Principles, or Aristotelian Elements; since not only the Air, but that vast expansion we call Heaven, in comparison of which Page 313our Terrestrial Globe (supposing it were all Solid) is but a point; and perhaps to the Sun and the fixt Stars are fluid bodies. I demand also, from which of the Chymical Principles Motion flowes; which yet is an affection of matter much more General then any that can be deduc'd from any of the three Chymical Principles. I might ask the like Question concerning Light, which is not only to be found in the Kindl'd Sulphur of mixt Bodis, but (not to mention those sorts of rotten Woods, and rotten Fish that shine in the Dark) in the tails of living Glow-wormes, and in the Vast bodies of the Sun and Stars. I would gladly also know, in which of the three Principles the Quality, we call Sound, resides as in its proper Subject; since either Oyl falling upon Oyle, or Spirit upon Spirit, or Salt upon Salt, in a great quantity, and from a considerable height, will make a noise, or if you please, create a sound, and (that the objection may reach the Aristotelians) so will also water upon water, and Earth upon Earth. And I could name other qualities to be met within divers bodies, of which I Image 168 (page 314)suppose my Adversaries will not in haste assign any Subject, upon whose Account it must needs be, that the quality belongs to all the other several bodies. And, before I proceed any further, I must here invite you to compare the supposition we are examining, with some other of the Chymical Tenents. For, first they do in effect teach that more then one quality may belong to, and be deduc'd from, one Principle. For, they ascribe to Salt Tasts, and the power of Coagulation; to sulphur, as well Odours as inflamableness; And some of them ascribe to Mercury, Colours; as all of them do effumability, as they speak. And on the other side, it is evident that Volatility belongs in common to all the three Principles, and to Water too. For 'tis manifest, that Chymical Oyles are Volatile; That also divers Salts Emerging, upon the Analysis of many Concretes, are very Volatile, is plain from the figitiveness of Salt, of Harts-horne, flesh, &c. ascending in the Distillation of those bodies. How easily water may be made to ascend in Vapours, there is scarce any body that has not observ'd. And as Page 315for what they call the Mercuriall Principle of bodies, that is so apt to be rais'd in the form of Steam, that Paracelsus and others define it by that aptness to fly up; so that (to draw that inference by the way) it seems not that Chymists have been accurate in their Doctrine of qualities, and their respective Principles, since they both derive several qualities from the same Principle, and must ascribe the same quality to almost all their Principles and other bodies besides. And thus much for the first thing taken for granted, without sufficient proof, by your Sennertus: And to add that upon the Bye (continues Carneades) we may hence learn what to judge of the way of Argumentation, which that fierce Champion of the Aristotelians against the Chymists, In Thessalo redivivo. Cap. 10. pag. 73. & 74. Anthonius Guntherus Billichius employes, where he pretends to prove against Beguinus, that not only the four Elements do immediately concur to Constitute every mixt body, and are both present in it, and obtainable from it upon its Dissolution; but that in the Tria Prima themselves, whereinto Chymists are wont to resolve mixt Bodies, each of them clearly discovers Image 169 (page 316)it self to consist of four Elements. The Ratiocination it self (pursues Carneades) being somewhat unusual, I did the other Day Transcribe it, and (sayes He, pulling a Paper out of his Pocket) it is this. Ordiamur, cum Beguino, a ligno viridi, quod si concremetur, videbis in sudore Aquam, in fumo Aerem, in flamma & Prunis Ignem, Terram in cineribus: Quod si Beguino placuerit ex eo colligere humidum aquosum, cohibere humidum oleaginosum, extrahere ex cineribus salem; Ego ipsi in unoquoque horum seorsim quatuor Elementa ad oculum demonstrabo, eodem artificio quo in ligno viridi ea demonstravi. Humorem aquosum admovebo Igni. Ipse Aquam Ebullire videbit, in Vapore Aerem conspiciet, Ignem sentiet in aestu, plus minus Terrae in sedimento apparebit. Humor porro Oleaginosus aquam humiditate & fluiditate per se, accensus vero Ignem flamma prodit, fumo Aerem, fuligine, nidore & amurca terram. Salem denique ipse Beguinus siccum vocat & Terrestrem, qui tamen nec fusus Aquam, nec caustica vi ignem celare potest; ignis vero Violentia in halitus versus nec ab Aere se alienum esse demonstrat; Idem de Lacte, de Ovis, desemine Lini, de Garyophyllis, de Nitro, Page 317de sale Marino, denique de Antimonio, quod fuit de Ligno viridi Judicium; eadem de illorum partibus, quas Beguinus adducit, sententia, quae de viridis ligni humore aquoso, quae de liquore ejusdem oleoso, quae de sale fuit. This bold Discourse (resumes Carneades, putting up again his Paper,) I think it were not very difficult to confure, if his Arguments were as considerable as our time will probably prove short for the remaining and more necessary Part of my Discourse; wherefore referring You for an Answer to what was said concerning the Dissipated Parts of a burnt piece of green Wood, to what I told Themistius on the like occasion, I might easily shew You, how sleightly and superficially our Guntherus talks of the dividing the flame of Green Wood into his four Elements; When he makes that vapour to be air, which being caught in Glasses and condens'd, presently discovers it self to have been but an Aggregate of innumerable very minute drops of Liquor; and When he would prove the Phlegmes being compos'd of Fire by that Heat which is adventitious to the Liquor, and ceases upon the absence of what produc'd Image 170 (page 319)it (whether that be an Agitation proceeding from the motion of the External Fire, or the presence of a Multitude of igneous Atomes pervading the pores of the Vessel, and nimbly permeating the whole Body of the Water) I might, I say, urge these and divers other Weaknesses of His Discourse. But I will rather take Notice of what is more pertinent to the Occasion of this Digression, namely, that Taking it for Granted, that Fluidity (with which he unwarily seems to confound Humidity) must proceed from the Element of Water, he makes a Chymical Oyle to Consist of that Elementary Liquor; and yet in the very next Words proves, that it consists also of Fire, by its Inflamability; not remembring that exquisitely pure Spirit of Wine is both more Fluid then Water it self, and yet will Flame all away without leaving the Least Aqueous Moisture behind it; and without such an Amurca and Soot as he would Deduce the presence of Earth from. So that the same Liquor may according to his Doctrine be concluded by its great Fluidity to be almost all Water; and by its burning all away to be all disguised Page 318Fire. And by the like way of Probation our Author would shew that the fixt salt of Wood is compounded of the four Elements. For (sayes he) being turn'd by the violence of the Fire into steames, it shews it self to be of kin to Air; whereas I doubt whether he ever saw a true fixt Salt (which to become so, must have already endur'd the violence of an Incinerating Fire) brought by the Fire alone to ascend in the Forme of Exhalations; but I do not doubt that if he did, and had caught those Exhalations in convenient Vessels, he would have found them as well as the Steames of common Salt, &c. of a Saline and not an Aereal Nature. And whereas our Authour takes it also for Granted, that the Fusibility of Salt must be Deduc'd from Water, it is indeed so much the Effect of heat variously agitating the Minute Parts of a Body, without regard to Water, that Gold (which by its being the heavyest and fixtest of Bodies, should be the most Earthy) will be brought to Fusion by a strong Fire; which sure is more likely to drive away then increase its Aqueous Ingredient, if it have any; and on the other side, for want of a sufficient agitation Image 171 (page 320)of its minute parts, Ice is not Fluid, but Solid; though he presumes also that the Mordicant Quality of Bodies must proceed from a fiery ingredient; whereas, not to urge that the Light and inflamable parts, which are the most likely to belong to the Element of Fire, must probably be driven away by that time the violence of the Fire has reduc'd the Body to ashes; Not to urge this, I I say, nor that Oyle of Vitriol which quenches Fire, burnes the Tongue and flesh of those that Unwarily tast or apply it, as a caustick doth, it is precarious to prove the Presence of Fire in fixt salts from their Caustick power, unlesse it were first shewn, that all the Qualities ascribed to salts must be deduc'd from those of the Elements; which, had I Time, I could easily manifest to be no easy talk. And not to mention that our Authour makes a Body as Homogeneous as any he can produce for Elementary, belong both to Water and Fire, Though it be neither Fluid nor Insipid, like Water; nor light and Volatile, like Fire; he seems to omit in this Anatomy the Element of Earth, save That he intimates, That the salt may pass for Page 321that; But since a few lines before, he takes Ashes for Earth, I see not how he will avoid an Inconsistency either betwixt the Parts of his Discourse or betwixt some of them and his Doctrine. For since There is a manifest Difference betwixt the Saline and the insipid Parts of Ashes, I see not how substances That Disagree in such Notable Qualities can be both said to be Portions of an Element, whose Nature requires that it be Homogeneous, especially in this case where an Analysis by the Fire is suppos'd to have separated it from the admixture of other Elements, which are confess'd by most Aristotelians to be Generally found in common Earth, and to render it impure. And sure if when we have consider'd for how little a Disparities sake the Peripateticks make these Symbolizing Bodies Aire and Fire to be two Distinct Elements, we shall also consider that the Saline part of Ashes is very strongly Tasted, and easily soluble in Water; whereas the other part of the same Ashes is insipid and indissoluble in the same Liquor: Not to add, that the one substance is Opacous, and the other somewhat Image 172 (page 322)Diaphanous, nor that they differ in Divers other Particulars; If we consider those things, I say, we shall hardly think that both these Substances are Elementary Earth; And as to what is sometimes objected, that their Saline Tast is only an Effect of Incineration and Adustion, it has been elsewhere fully reply'd to, when propos'd by Themistius, and where it has been prov'd against him, that however insipid Earth may perhaps by Additaments be turn'd into Salt, yet 'tis not like it should be so by the Fire alone: For we see that when we refine Gold and Silver, the violentest Fires We can Employ on them give them not the least Rellish of Saltness. And I think Philoponus has rightly observ'd, that the Ashes of some Concretes contain very little salt if any at all; For Refiners suppose that boneashes are free from it, and therefore make use of them for Tests and Cuppels, which ought to be Destitute of Salt, lest the Violence of the Fire should bring them to Vitrification; And having purposely and heedfully tasted a Cuppel made of only bone-ashes and fair water, which I had caus'd to be expos'd Page 323to a Very Violent Fire, acuated by the Blast of a large pair of Double Bellows, I could not perceive that the force of the Fire bad imparted to it the least Saltness, or so much as made it less Insipid. But (sayes Carneades) since neither You nor I love Repetitions, I shall not now make any of what else was urg'd against Themistius but rather invite You to take notice with me that when our Authour, though a Learned Man, and one that pretends skill enough in Chymistry to reforme the whole Art, comes to make good his confident Undertaking, to give us an occular Demonstration of the immediate Presence of the four Elements in the resolution of Green Wood, He is fain to say things that agree very little with one another. For about the beginning of that passage of His lately recited to you, he makes the sweat as he calls it of the green Wood to be Water, the smoke Aire, the shining Matter Fire, and the Ashes Earth; whereas a few lines after, he will in each of these, nay (as I just now noted) in one Distinct Part of the Ashes, shew the four Elements. So that either the former Analysis Image 173 (page 324)must be incompetent to prove that Number of Elements, since by it the burnt Concrete is not reduc'd into Elementary Bodies, but into such as are yet each of them compounded of the four Elements; or else these Qualities from which he endeavours to deduce the presence of all the Elements, in the fixt salt, and each of the other separated substances, will be but a precarious way of probation: especially if you consider, that the extracted Alcali of Wood, being for ought appears at least as similar a Body as any that the Peripateticks can shew us, if its differing Qualities must argue the presence of Distinct Elements, it will scarce be possible for them by any way they know of employing the fire upon a Body, to shew that any Body is a Portion of a true Element: And this recals to my mind, that I am now but in an occasional Excussion, which aiming only to shew that the Peripateticks as well as the Chymists take in our present Controversie something for granted which they ought to prove, I shall returne to my exceptions, where I ended the first of them, and further tell you, that neither is that the only precarious Page 325thing that I take notice of in Sennertus his Argumentation; for when he inferrs, that because the Qualities he Mentions as Colours, Smels, and the like, belong not to the Elements; they therefore must to the Chymical Principles, he takes that for granted, which will not in haste be prov'd; as I might here manifest, but that I may be and by have a fitter opportunity to take notice of it. And thus much at present may suffice to have Discours'd against the Supposition, that almost every Quality must have some  in non-Latin alphabet 	, as they speak, some Native receptacle, wherein as in its proper Subject of in hesion it peculiarly resides, and on whose account that quality belongs to the other Bodies, Wherein it is to be met with. Now this Fundamental supposition being once Destroy'd, whatsoever is built upon it, must fall to ruine of it self. But I consider further, that Chymists are (for ought I have found) far from being able to explicate by any of the Tria Prima, those qualities which they pretend to belong primarily unto it, and in mixt Bodies to Deduce from it. Tis true indeed, that such qualities Image 174 (page 326)are not explicable by the four Elements; but it will not therefore follow, that they are so by the three hermetical Principles; and this is it that seems to have deceiv'd the Chymists, and is indeed a very common mistake amongst most Disputants, who argue as if there could be but two Opinions concerning the Difficulty about which they contend; and consequently they inferr, that if their Adversaries Opinion be Erroneous, Their's must needs be the Truth; whereas many questions, and especially in matters Physiological, may admit of so many Differing Hypotheses, that 'twill be very inconsiderate and fallacious to conclude (except where the Opinions are precisely Contradictory) the Truth of one from the falsity of another. And in our particular case 'tis no way necessary, that the Properties of mixt Bodies must be explicable either by the Hermetical, or the Aristotelian Hypothesis, there being divers other and more plausible wayes of explaining them, and especially that, which deduces qualities from the motion, figure, and contrivance of the small parts of Bodies; as I think might be Page 327shewn, if the attempt were as seasonable, as I fear it would be Tedious. I will allow then, that the Chymists do not causelessly accuse the Doctrine of the four elements of incompetency to explain the Properties of Compound bodies. And for this Rejection of a Vulgar Error, they ought not to be deny'd what praise men may deserve for exploding a Doctrine whose Imperfections are so conspicuous, that men needed but not to shut their Eyes, to discover them. But I am mistaken, if our Hermetical Philosophers Themselves need not, as well as the Peripateticks, have Recourse to more Fruitfull and Comprehensive Principles then the trial Prima, to make out the Properties of the Bodies they converse with. Not to accumulate Examples to this purpose, (because I hope for a fitter opportunity to prosecute this Subject) let us at present only point at Colour, that you may guess by what they say of so obvious and familiar a Quality, how little Instruction we are to expect from the Tria Prima in those more abstruse ones, which they with the Aristotelians stile Occult. For about Colours, neither Image 175 (page 328)do they at all agree among themselves, nor have I met with any one, of which of the three Perswasions soever, that does intelligibly explicate Them. The Vulgar Chymists are wont to ascribe Colours to Mercury; De Cons. & dissen. cap. 11. pag. 186. Paracelsus in divers places attributes them to Salt; and Sennertus, having recited their differing Opinions, Dissents from both, and referrs Colours rather unto Sulphur. But how Colours do, nay, how they may, arise from either of these Principles, I think you will scarce say that any has yet intelligibly explicated. And if Mr. Boyle will allow me to shew you the Experiments which he has collected about Colours, you will, I doubt not, confess that bodies exhibite colours, not upon the Account of the Predominancy of this or that Principle in them, but upon that of their Texture, and especially the Disposition of their superficial parts, whereby the Light rebounding thence to the Eye is so modifi'd, as by differing Impressions variously to affect the Organs of Sight. I might here take notice of the pleasing variety of Colours exhibited by the Triangular glass, (as 'tis wont to be call'd) and demand, Page 329what addition or decrement of either Salt, Sulphur, or Mercury, befalls the Body of the Glass by being Prismatically figur'd; and yet 'tis known, that without that shape it would not affor'd those colours as it does. But because it may be objected, that these are not real, but apparent Colours; that I may not lose time in examing the Distinction, I will alledge against the Chymists, a couple of examples of Real and Permanent Colours Drawn from Metalline Bodies, and represent, that without the addition of any extraneous body, Quicksilver may by the Fire alone, and that in glass Vessels, be depriv'd of its silver-like Colour, and be turn'd into a Red Body; and from this Red Body without Addition likewise may be obtain'd a Mercury Bright and Specular as it was before; So that I have here a lasting Colour Generated and Destroy'd (as I have seen) at pleasure, without adding or taking away either Mercury, Salt, or Sulphur; and if you take a clean and slender piece of harden'd steel, and apply to it the flame of a candle at some little distance short of the point, You shall not have held Image 176 (page 330)the Steel long in the flame, but You shall perceive divers Colours, as Yellow, Red and Blew, to appear upon the Surface of the metal, and as it were run along in chase of one another towards the point; So that the same body, and that in one and the same part, may not only have a new colour produc'd in it, but exhibite successively divers Colours within a minute of an hour, or thereabouts; and any of these Colours may by Removing the Steel from the Fire, become Permanent, and last many years. And this Production and Variety of Colours cannot reasonably be suppos'd to proceed from the Accession of any of the three Principles, to which of them soever Chymists will be pleas'd to ascribe Colours; especially considering, that if you but suddenly Refrigerate that Iron, First made Red hot, it will be harden'd and Colourless again; and not only by the Flame of a Candle, but by any other equivalent heat Conveniently appli'd, the like Colours will again be made to appear and succeed one another, as at the First. But I must not any further prosecute an Occasional Discourse, though Page 331that were not so Difficult for me to do, as I fear it would be for the Chymists to give a better Account of the other Qualities, by their Principles, then they have done of Colours. And your Sennertus Himself (though an Author I much value) would I fear have been exceedingly puzl'd to resolve, by the Tria Prima, halfe that Catalogue of Problems, Senuert. de Con. seus. & Dissens. pag. 165.166. which he challenges the Vulgar Peripateticks to explicate by their four Elements. And supposing it were true, that Salt or Sulphur were the Principle to which this or that Quality may be peculiarly referr'd, yet though he that teaches us this teaches us something concerning That quality, yet he Teaches us but something. For indeed he does not Teach us That which can in any Tollerable measure satisfie an inquisitive Searcher after Truth. For what is it to me to know, that such a quality resides in such a Principle or Element, whilst I remain altogether ignorant of the Cause of that quality, and the manner of its production and Operation? How little do I know more then any Ordinary Man of Gravity, if I know but that the Heaviness of mixt Image 177 (page 332)bodies proceeds from that of the Earth they are compos'd of, if I know not the reason why the Earth is Heavy? And how little does the Chymist teach the Philosopher of the Nature of Purgatition, if he only tells him that the Purgative Vertue of Medicines resides in their Salt? For, besides that this must not be conceded without Limitation, since the purging parts of many Vegetables Extracted by the Water wherein they are infus'd, are at most but such compounded Salts, (I mean mingl'd with Oyle, and Spirit, and Earth, as Tartar and divers other Subjects of the Vegetable Kingdom afford;) And since too that Quicksilver precipitated either with Gold, or without Addition, into a powder, is wont to be strongly enough Cathartical, though the Chymists have not yet prov'd, that either Gold or Mercury have any Salt at all, much less any that is Purgative; Besides this, I say, how little is it to me, to know That 'tis the Salt of the Rhubarb (for Instance) that purges, if I find That it does not purge as Salt; since scarce any Elementary Salt is in small quantity cathartical. And if I know not how Page 333Purgation in general is effected in a Humane Body? In a word, as 'tis one thing to know a mans Lodging, and another, to be acquainted with him; so it may be one thing to know the subject wherein a Quality principally resides, and another thing to have a right notion and knowledg of the quality its self. Now that which I take to be the reason of this Chymical Deficiency, is the same upon whose account I think the Aristotelian and divers other Theories incompetent to explicate the Origen of Qualities. For I am apt to think, that men will never be able to explain the Phaenomena of Nature, while they endeavour to deduce them only from the Presence and Proportion of such or such material Ingredients, and consider such ingredients or Elements as Bodies in a state of rest; whereas indeed the greatest part of the affections of matter, and consequently of the Phaenomena of nature, seems to depend upon the motion and the continuance of the small parts of Bodies. For 'tis by motion that one part of matter acts upon another; and 'tis, for the most part, the texture of the Body upon which the moving parts strike, that modifies to motion Image 178 (page 334)or Impression, and concurrs with it to the production of those Effects which make up the chief part of the Naturalists Theme. But (sayes Eleutherius) me thinks for all this, you have left some part of what I alledg'd in behalf of the three principles, unanswer'd. For all that you have said will not keep this from being a useful Discovery, that since in the Salt of one Concrete, in the Sulphur of another and the Mercury of a third, the Medicinal vertue of it resides, that Principle ought to be separated from the rest, and there the desired faculty must be sought for. I never denyed (Replyes Carneades) that the Notion of the Tria Prima may be of some use, but (continues he laughing) by what you now alledg for it, it will but appear That it is useful to Apothecaries, rather than to Philosophers, The being able to make things Operative being sufficient to those, whereas the Knowledge of Causes is the Thing looked after by These. And let me Tell You, Eleutherius, even this it self will need to be entertained with some caution. Page 335 For first, it will not presently follow, That if the Purgative or other vertue of a simple may be easily extracted by Water or Spirit of Wine, it Resides in the Salt or Sulphur of the Concrete; Since unlesse the Body have before been resolved by the Fire, or some Other Powerful Agent, it will, for the most part, afford in the Liquors I have named, rather the finer compounded parts of it self, Than the Elementary ones. As I noted before, That Water will dissolve not only pure Salts, but Crystals of Tartar, Gumme Arabick, Myrr'h, and Other Compound Bodies. As also Spirit of Wine will Dissolve not only the pure Sulphur of Concretes, but likewise the whole Substance of divers Resinous Bodies, as Benzoin, the Gummous parts of Jallap, Gumme Lacca, and Other bodies that are counted perfectly Mixt. And we see that the Extracts made either with Water or Spirit of Wine are not of a simple and Elementary Nature, but Masses consisting of the looser Corpuseles, and finer parts of the Concretes whence they are Drawn; since by Distillation they may be Divided into more Elementary substances. Image 179 (page 336) Next, we may consider That even when there intervenes a Chymical resolution by he Fire, 'tis seldom in the Saline or Sulphureous principle, as such, that the desir'd Faculty of the Concrete Resides; But, as that Titular Salt or Sulphur is yet a mixt body, though the Saline or Sulphureous Nature be predominant in it. For, if in Chymical Resolutions the separated Substances were pure and simple Bodies, and of a perfect Elementary Nature; no one would be indued with more Specifick Vertues, than another; and their qualities would Differ as Little as do those of Water. And let me add this upon the bye, That even Eminent Chymists have suffer'd themselves to be reprehended by me for their over great Diligence in purifying some of the things they obtain by Fire from mixt Bodies. For though such compleatly purifyed Ingredients of Bodies might perhaps be more satisfactory to our Understanding; yet others are often more useful to our Lives, the efficacy of such Chymical Productions depending most upon what they retain of the Bodies whence they are separated, or gain by the new associations of the Dissipated Page 337among themselves; whereas if they were meerly Elementary, their uses would be comparatively very small; and the vertues of Sulphurs, Salts, or Other such Substances of one denomination, would be the very same. And by the Way (Eleutherius) I am inclin'd upon this ground to Think, That the artificial resolution of compound bodies by Fire does not so much enrich mankind, as it divides them into their supposed Principles; as upon the score of its making new compounds by new combinations of the dissipated parts of the resolv'd Body. For by this means the Number of mixt Bodies is considerably increased. And many of those new productions are indow'd with useful qualities, divers of which they owe not to the body from which they were obtein'd, but to Their newly Acquired Texture. But thirdly, that which is principally to be Noted is this, that as there are divers Concretes whose Faculties reside in some one or other of those differing Substances that Chymists call their Sulphurs, Salts, and Mercuries, and consequently may be best obtain'd, by analyzing Image 180 (page 338)the Concrete whereby the desired Principles may be had sever'd or freed from the rest; So there are other wherein the noblest properties lodge not in the Salt, or Sulphur, or Mercury, but depend immediately upon the form (or if you will) result from the determinate structure of the Whole Concrete; and consequently they that go about to extract the Vertues of such bodies, by exposing them to the Violence of the Fire, do exceedingly mistake, and take the way to Destroy what they would obtain. I remmember that Helmont himself somewhere confesses, That as the Fire betters some things and improves their Vertues, so it spoyles others and makes them degenerate. And elsewhere he judiciously affirmes, that there may be sometimes greater vertue in a simple, such as Nature has made it, than in any thing that can by the fire be separated from it. Helm out Pharm. & Dispens. Nov. p. 438. And lest you should doubt whether he means by the vertues of things those that are Medical; he has in one place this ingenuous confession; Credo (sayes he) simplicia in sua simplicitate esse sufficientia pro sanatione omnium morborum. Page 339Nag. Barthias, even in a Comment upon Beguinus, Vide Jer. ad Begu. Lib. 1. Cap. 17. scruples not to make this acknowledgment; Valde absurdum est (sayes he) ex omnibus rebus extracta facere, salia, quintas essentias; praesertim ex substantiis per se plane vel subtilibus vel homogeneis, quales sunt uniones, Corallia, Moscus, Ambra, &c. Consonantly whereunto he also tells Us (and Vouches the famous Platerus, for having candidly given the same Advertisement to his Auditors,) that some things have greater vertues, and better suited to our humane nature, when unprepar'd, than when they have past the Chymists Fire; as we see, sayes my Author, in Pepper; of which some grains swallowed perform more towards the relief of a Distempered stomack, than a great quantity of the Oyle of the same spice. It has been (pursues Carneades) by our Friend here present observ'd concerning Salt-petre, that none of the substances into which the Fire is wont to divide it, retaines either the Tast, the cooling vertue, or some other of the properties of the Concrete; and that each of those Substances acquires new qualities, not to be found in the Salt-Petre it self. The Image 181 (page 340)shining property of the tayls of gloworms does survive but so short a time the little animal made conspicuous by it, that inquisitive men have not scrupled publickly to deride Baptista Porta and others; who deluded perhaps with some Chymical surmises have ventur'd to prescribe the distillation of a Water from the tayles of Glowormes, as a sure way to obtain a liquor shining in the Dark. To which I shall now add no other example than that afforded us by Amber; which, whilst it remains an intire body, is endow'd with an Electrical faculty of drawing to it self fethers, strawes, and such like Bodies; which I never could observe either in its Salt, its Spirit, its Oyle, or in the Body I remember I once made by the reunion of its divided Elements; none of these having such a Texture as the intire Goncrete. And however Chymists boldly deduce such and such properties from this or that proportion of their component Principles; yet in Concretes that abound with this or that Ingredient, 'tis not alwayes so much by vertue of its presence, nor its plenty, that the Concrete is qualify'd to perform such and such Effects; as upon the account Page 341of the particular texture of that and the other Ingredients, associated after a determinate Manner into one Concrete (though possibly such a proportion of that ingredient may be more convenient than an other for the constituting of such a body.) Thus in a clock the hand is mov'd upon the dyal, the bell is struck, and the other actions belonging to the engine are perform'd, not because the Wheeles are of brass or iron, or part of one metal and part of another, or because the weights are of Lead, but by Vertue of the size, shape, bigness, and co-aptation of the several parts; which would performe the same things though the wheels were of Silver, or Lead, or Wood, and the Weights of Stone or Clay; provided the Fabrick or Contrivance of the engine were the same: though it be not to be deny'd, that Brasse and Steel are more convenient materials to make clock-wheels of than Lead, or Wood. And to let you see, Eleutherius, that 'tis sometimes at least, upon the Texture of the small parts of a body, and not alwaies upon the presence, or recesse, or increase, or Decrement of any one of its Principle, that it may lose some Image 182 (page 142)such Qualities, and acquire some such others as are thought very strongly inherent to the bodies they Reside in. I will add to what may from my past discourse be refer'd to this purpose, this Notable Example, from my Own experience; That Lead may without any additament, and only by various applications of the Fire, lose its colour, and acquire sometimes a gray, sometimes a yellowish, sometimes a red, sometimes an amethihstine colour; and after having past through these, and perhaps divers others, again recover its leaden colour, and be made a bright body. That also this Lead, which is so flexible a metal, may be made as brittle as Glasse, and presently be brought to be again flexible and Malleable as before. And besides, that the same lead, which I find by Microscopes to be one of the most opacous bodies in the World, may be reduced to a fine transparent glasse; whence yet it may returne to an opacous Nature again; and all this, as I said, without the addition of any extraneous body, and meerly by the manner and Method of exposing it to the Fire. But (sayes Carneades) after having already Page 343put you to so prolix a trouble, it is time for me to relieve you with a promise of putting speedily a period to it; And to make good that promise, I shall from all that I have hitherto discoursed with you, deduce but this one proposition by way of Corollary. [That it may as yet be doubted, whether or no there be any determinate Number of Elements; Or, if you please, whether or no all compound bodies, do consist of the same number of Elementary ingredients or material Principles.] This being but an inference from the foregoing Discourse, it will not be requisite to insist at large on the proofs of it; But only to point at the chief of Them, and Referr You for Particulars to what has been already Delivered. In the First place then, from what has been so largely discours'd, it may appear, that the Experiments wont to be brought, whether by the common Peripateticks, or by the vulgar Chymists, to demonstrate that all mixt bodies are made up precisely either of the four Elements, or the three Hypostatical Principles, do not evince what they are alledg'd to prove. And as for the other common arguments, pretended to be Image 183 (page 344)drawn from Reason in favour of the Aristotelian Hypothesis (for the Chymists are wont to rely almost altogether upon Experiments) they are Commonly grounded upon such unreasonable or precarious Suppositions, that 'tis altogether as easie and as just for any man to reject them, as for those that take them for granted to assert them, being indeed all of them as indemonstrable as the conclusion to be inferr'd from them; and some of them so manifestly weak and prooflesse; that he must be a very courteous adversary, that can be willing togrant them; and as unskilful a one, that can be compelled to do so. In the next place, it may be considered, if what those Patriarchs of the Spagyrists, Paracelsus and Helmont, do on divers occasions positively deliver, be true; namely that the Alkahest does Resolve all mixt Bodies into other Principles than the fire, it must be decided which of the two resolutions (that made by the Alkahest, or that made by the fire) shall determine the number of the Elements, before we can be certain how many there are. And in the mean time, we may take Page 345notice in the last place, that as the distinct substances whereinto the Alkahest divides bodies, are affirm'd to be differing in nature from those whereunto they are wont to be reduc'd by fire, Novi saxum & lapides omnes in merum salem suo saxo aut lapidi & aequiponderantem reducere absque omni prorsus sulphurc aut Mercurio. Helmont. pag. 409. and to be obtain'd from some bodies more in Number than from some others; since he tells us, he could totally reduce all sorts of Stones into Salt only, whereas of a coal he had two distinct Liquors. So, although we should acquiesce in that resolution which is made by fire, we find not that all mixt bodies are thereby divided into the same number of Elements and Principles; some Concretes affordding more of them than others do; Nay and sometimes this or that Body affording a greater number of Differing substances by one way of management, than the same yields by another. And they that out of Gold, or Mercury, or Muscovy-glasse, will draw me as many distinct substances as I can separate from Vitriol, or from the juice of Grapes variously orderd, may teach me that which I shall very Thankfully learn. Nor does it appear Image 184 (page 346)more congruous to that variety that so much conduceth to the perfection of the Universe, that all elemented bodies be compounded of the same numberof Elements, then it would be for a language, that all its words should consist of the same number of Letters.   Page 347 THE SCEPTICAL CHYMIST OR, A Paradoxical Appendix to the Foregoing Treatise. The Sixth Part. HEre Carneades Having Dispach't what he Thought Requisite to oppose against what the Chymists are wont to alledge for Proof of their three Principles, Paus'd awhile, and look'd about him, to discover whether it were Time for him and his Friend to Rejoyne the Rest of the Company. But Eleutherius perceiving nothing yet to Image 185 (page 348)forbid Them to Prosecute their Discourse a little further, said to his Friend, (who had likewise taken Notice of the same thing) I halfe expected, Carneades, that after you had so freely declar'd Your doubting, whether there be any Determinate Number of Elements, You would have proceeded to question whether there be any Elements at all. And I confess it will be a Trouble to me if You defeat me of my Expectation; especially since you see the leasure we have allow'd us may probably suffice to examine that Paradox; because you have so largly Deduc'd already many Things pertinent to it, that you need but intimate how you would have them Apply'd, and what you would inferr from them. Carneades having in Vain represented that their leasure could be but very short, that he had already prated very long, that he was unprepared to maintain so great and so invidious a Paradox, was at length prevail'd with to tell his Friend; Since, Eleutherius, you will have me Discourse Ex Tempore of the Paradox you mention, I am content, (though more perhaps to express my Page 349Obedience, then my Opinion) to tell you that (supposing the Truth of Helmonts and Paracelsus's Alkahestical Experiments, if I may so call them) though it may seem extravagant, yet it is not absurd to doubt, whether, for ought has been prov'd, there be a necessity to admit any Elements, or Hypostatical Principles, at all. And, as formerly, so now, to avoid the needless trouble of Disputing severally with the Aristotelians and the Chymists, I will address my self to oppose them I have last nam'd, Because their Doctrine about the Elements is more applauded by the Moderns, as pretending highly to be grounded upon Experience. And, to deal not only fairly but favourably with them, I will allow them to take in Earth and Water to their other Principles. Which I consent to, the rather that my Discourse may the better reach the Tenents of the Peripateticks; who cannot plead for any so probably as for those two Elements; that of fire above the Air being Generally by Judicious Men exploded as an Imaginary thing; And the Air not concurring to compose Mixt Image 186 (page 350)Bodies as one of their Elements, but only lodging in their pores, or Rather replenishing, by reason of its Weight and Fluidity, all those Cavities of bodies here below, whether compounded or not, that are big enough to admit it, and are not fill'd up with any grosser substance. And, to prevent mistakes, I must advertize You, that I now mean by Elements, as those Chymists that speak plainest do by their Principles, certain Primitive and Simple, or perfectly unmingled bodies; which not being made of any other bodies, or of one another, are the Ingredients of which all those call'd perfectly mixt Bodies are immediately compounded, and into which they are ultimately resolved: now whether there be any one such body to be constantly met with in all, and each, of those that are said to be Elemented bodies, is the thing I now question. By this State of the controversie you will, I suppose, Guess, that I need not be so absur'd as to deny that there are such bodies as Earth, and Water, and Quicksilver, and Sulphur: But I look upon Earth and Water, as component parts Page 351of the Universe, or rather of the Terrestrial Globe, not of all mixt bodies. And though I will not peremptorily deny that there may sometimes either a running Mercury, or a Combustible Substance be obtain'd from a Mineral, or even a Metal; yet I need not Concede either of them to be an Element in the sence above declar'd; as I shall have occasion to shew you by and by. To give you then a brief account of the grounds I intend to proceed upon, I must tell you, that in matters of Philosophy, this seems to me a sufficient reason to doubt of a known and important proposition, that the Truth of it is not yet by any competent proof made to appear. And congruously herunto, if I shew that the grounds upon which men are perswaded that there are Elements are unable to satisfie a considering man, I suppose my doubts will appear rational. Now the Considerations that induce men to think that there are Elements, may be conveniently enough referr'd to two heads. Namely, the one, that it is necessary that Nature make use of Elements to constitute the bodies that Image 187 (page 352)are reputed Mixt. And the other, That the Resolution of such bodies manifests that nature had compounded them of Elementary ones. In reference to the former of these Considerations, there are two or three things that I have to Represent. And I will begin with reminding you of the Experiments I not long since related to you concerning the growth of pompions, mint, and other vegetables, out of fair water. For by those experiments its seems evident, that Water may be Transmuted into all the other Elements; from whence it may be inferr'd, both, That 'tis not every Thing Chymists will call Salt, Sulphur, or Spirit, that needs alwayes be a Primordiate and Ingenerable body. And that Nature may contex a Plant (though that be a perfectly mixt Concrete) without having all the Elements previously presented to her to compound it of. And, if you will allow the relation I mention'd out of Mounsieur De Rochas to be True; then may not only plants, but Animals and Minerals too, be produced out of Water, And however there is little doubt to be made, but that the plants my tryals afforded me Page 353as they were like in so many other respects to the rest of the plants of the same Denomination; so they would, in case I had reduc'd them to putrefaction, have likewise produc'd Wormes or other infects, as well as the resembling Vegetables are wont to do; so that Water may, by Various Seminal Principles, be successively Transmuted into both plants and Animals. And if we consider that not only Men, but even sucking Children are, but too often, Tormented with Solid Stones, but that divers sorts of Beasts themselves, (whatever Helmont against Experience think to the contrary) may be Troubled with great and Heavy stones in their Kidneys and Bladders, though they Feed but upon Grass and other Vegetables, that are perhaps but Disguised Water, it will not seem improbable that even some Concretes of a mineral Nature, may Likewise be form'd of Water. We may further Take notice, that as a Plant may be nourisht, and consequently may Consist of Common water; so may both plants and Animals, (perhaps even from their Seminal Rudiments) consist of compound Bodies, Image 188 (page 354)without having any thing meerly Elementary brought them by nature to be compounded by them: This is evident in divers men, who whilst they were Infants were fed only with Milk, afterwards Live altogether upon Flesh, Fish, wine, and other perfectly mixt Bodies. It may be seen also in sheep, who on some of our English Downs or Plains, grow very fat by feeding upon the grasse, without scarce drinking at all. And yet more manifestly in the magots that breed and grow up to their full bignesse within the pulps of Apples, Pears, or the like Fruit. We see also, that Dungs that abound with a mixt Salt give a much more speedy increment to corn and other Vegetables than Water alone would do: And it hath been assur'd me, by a man experienc'd in such matters, that sometimes when to bring up roots very early, the Mould they were planted in was made over-rich, the very substance of the Plant has rasted of the Dung. And let us also consider a Graft of one kind of Fruit upon the upper bough of a Tree of another kind. As for instance, the Ciens of a Pear upon a White-thorne; for there the ascending Page 355Liquor is already alter'd, either by the root, or in its ascent by the bark, or both wayes, and becomes a new mixt body: as may appear by the differing qualities to be met with in the saps of several trees; as particularly, the medicinal vertue of the Birch-Water (which I have sometimes drunk upon Helmonts great and not undeserved commendation) Now the graft, being fasten'd to the stock must necessarily nourish its self, and produce its Fruit, only out of this compound Juice prepared for it by the Stock, being unable to come at any other aliment. And if we consider, how much of the Vegetable he feeds upon may (as we noted above) remain in an Animal; we may easily suppose, That the blood of that Animal who Feeds upon this, though it be a Well constituted Liquor, and have all the differing Corpuscles that make it up kept in order by one praesiding form, may be a strangely Decompounded Body, many of its parts being themselves decompounded. So little is it Necessary that even in the mixtures which nature her self makes in Animal and Vegetable Bodies, she should have pure Elements at hand to make her compositions of. Image 189 (page 356) Having said thus much touching the constitution of Plants and Animals, I might perhaps be able to say as much touching that of Minerals, and even Metalls, if it were as easy for us to make experiment in Order to the production of these, as of those. But the growth or increment of Minerals being usually a work of excessively long time, and for the most part perform'd in the bowels of the Earth, where we cannot see it, I must instead of Experiments make use, on this occasion, of Observations. That stones were not all made at once, but that are some of them now adayes generated, may (though it be deny'd by some) be fully prov'd by several examples, of which I shall now scarce alledg any other, then that famous place in France known by the name of Les Caves Gentieres, where the Water falling from the upper Parts of the cave to the ground does presently there condense into little stones, of such figures as the drops, falling either severally or upon one another, and coagulating presently into stone, chance to exhibit. Of these stones some Ingenuous Friends of ours, that went a while since to visit that place, did me Page 357the favour to present me with some that they brought thence. And I remember that both that sober Relator of his Voyages, Van Linschoten, and another good Author, inform us that in the Diamond Mines (as they call them) in the East-Indies, when having dig'd the Earth, though to no great depth, they find Diamonds and take them quite away; Yet in a very few years they find in the same place new Diamonds produc'd there since. From both which Relations, especially the first, it seems probable that Nature does not alwayes stay for divers Elementary Bodies, when she is to produce stones. And as for Metals themselves, Authors of good note assure us, that even they were not in the beginning produc'd at once altogether, but have been observ'd to grow; so that what was not a Mineral or Metal before became one afterwards. Of this it were easie to alledg many testimonies of professed Chymists. But that they may have the greater authority, I shall rather present you with a few borrowed from more unsuspected writers. Sulphuris Mineram (as the inquisitive P. Fallopius notes) quae nutrix est caloris subterranei Image 190 (page 158)fabri seu Archaei fontium & mineralium, Infra terram citissime renasci testantur Historiae Metallicae. Sunt enim loca e quibus si hoc anno sulphur effossum fuerit; intermissa fossione per quadriennium redeunt fossores & omnia sulphure, ut autea, rursus inveniunt plena. Pliny Relates, In Italiae Insula Ilva, gigni ferri metallum. Strabo multo expressius; effossum ibi metallum semper regenerari. Nam si effossio spatio centum annorum intermittebatur, & iterum illue revertebantur, fossores reperisse maximam copiam ferri regeneratam. Which history not only is countenanced by Fallopius, from the Incom which the Iron of that Island yielded the Duke of Florence in his time; but is mention'd more epressely to our porpose, by the Learned Cesalpinus. Vena (sayes he) ferri copiofissima est in Italia; ob eam nobilitata Ilva Tirrheni maris Insula incredibili copia, etiam nostris temporibus eam gignens: Nam terra quae eruitur dum vena effoditur tota, procedente tempore in venam convertitur. Which last clause is therefore very notable, because from thence we may deduce, that earth, by a Metalline plastick principle latent in it, may be in processe of time chang'd into a metal. And even Agricola Page 359himself, though the Chymists complain of him as their adversary, acknowledges thus much and more; by telling us that at a Town called Saga in Germany, In Lygiis, ad Sagam opidum; in pratis eruitur ferrum, fossis ad altitudinem bipedaneam actis. Id decennio renatum denuo fo ditur non aliter ac Ilvae ferrum. they dig up Iron in the Fields, by sinking ditches two foot deep; And adding,  * that within the space of ten years the Ditches are digged again for Iron since produced, As the same Metal is wont to be obtain'd in Elva. Also concerning Lead, not to mention what even Galen notes, that it will increase both in bulk and Weight if it be long kept in Vaults or Sellars, where the Air is gross and thick, as he collects from the smelling of those pieces of Lead that were imploy'd to fasten together the parts of old Statues. Not to mention this, I say, Boccacius Certaldus, as I find him Quoted by a Diligent VVriter, has this Passage touching the Growth of Lead. Fessularum mons (sayes he) in Hetruria, Florentiae civitati imminens, lapides plumbarios babet; qui si excidantur, brevi temporis spatio, novis incrementis instaurantur; ut (annexes my Author) tradit Image 191 (page 360)Boccacius Cortaldus, qui id compotissimum esse scribit. Nihil hoc novi est; sed de eadem Plinius, lib. 34. Hist. Natur. cap. 17. dudum prodidit, Inquiens, mirum in his solis plumbi metallis, quod derelicta fertilius reviviscunt. In plumbariis secundo Lapide ab Amberga dictis ad Asylum recrementa congesta in cumulos,  exposita solibus pluviisque paucis annis, reddunt suum metallum cum fenore. I might Add to these, continues Carneades, many things that I have met with concerning the Generation of Gold and Silver. But, for fear of wanting time, I shall mention but two or three Narratives. The First you may find Recorded by Gerhardus the Physick Professor, in these Words. In valle (sayes he) Joachimaca argentum gramini modo & more e Lapidibus minerae velut e radice excrevisse digiti Longitudine, testis est Dr. Schreterus, qui ejusmodi venas aspectu jucundas & admirabiles Domi sua aliis saepe monstravit & Donavit. Item Aqua caerulea Inventa est Annebergae, ubi argentum erat adhuc in primo ente, quae coagulata redacta est in calcem fixi & boni argenti. The other two Relations I have not met with in Latine Authours, and yet Page 361they are both very memorable in themselves, and as pertinent to our present purpose. The first I meet with in the Commentary of Johannes Valehius upon the Kleine Baur, In which that Industrious Chymist Relates, with many circumstances, that at a Mine-Town (If I may so English the German Bergstat) eight miles or Leagues distant from Strasburg call'd Mariakirch, a Workman came to the Overseer, and desired employment; but he telling him that there was not any of the best sort at present for him, added that till he could be preferr'd to some such, he might in the mean time, to avoid idleness, work in a Grove or Mine-pit thereabouts, which at that time was little esteem'd. This Workman after some weeks Labour, had by a Crack appearing in the Stone upon a Stroak given near the wall, an Invitation Given him to Work his Way through, which as soon as he had done, his Eyes were saluted by a mighty stone or Lump which stood in the middle of the Cleft (that had a hollow place behind it) upright, and in shew like an armed-man; but consisted of pure fine Image 192 (page 362)Silver having no Vein or Ore by it, or any other Additament, but stood there free, having only underfoot something like a burnt matter; and yet this one Lump held in Weight above a 1000 marks, which, according to the Dutch, Account makes 500 pound weight of fine silver. From which and other Circumstances my Author gathers; That by the warmth of the place, the Noble Metalline Spirits, (Sulphureous and Mercurial) were carri'd from the neighbouring Galleries or Vaults, through other smaller Cracks and Clefts, into that Cavity, and there collected as in a close Chamber or Cellar; whereinto when they were gotten, they did in process of time settle into the forementioned precious mass of Metal. The other Germane Relation is of That great Traveller and Laborious Chymist Johannes (not Georgus) Agricola; who in his notes upon what Poppius has written of Antimony, Relates, that when he was among the Hungarian Mines in the deep Groves, he observ'd that there would often arise in them a warm Steam (not of that malignant sort which the Germains call Shwadt, Page 363which (sayes he) is a meer poyson, and often suffocates the Diggers, which fasten'd it self to the Walls; and that coming again to review it after a couple of dayes, he discern'd that it was all very fast, and glistering; whereupon having collected it and Distill'd it per Retortam, he obtain'd from it a fine Spirit, adding, that the Mine-Men inform'd him, that this Steam or Damp of the English Mine (retaining the dutch Term) would at last have become a Metal, as Gold or Silver. I referr (sayes Carneades) to another Occasion, the Use that may be made of these Narratives towards the explicating the Nature of Metalls; and that of Fixtness, Malleableness, and some other Qualities conspicuous in them. And in the mean time, this I may at present deduce from these Observations, That 'tis not very probable, that, whensoever a Mineral, or even a Metall, is to be Generated in the Bowels of the Earth, Nature needs to have at hand both Salt, and Sulphur, and Mercury to Compound it of; for, not to urge that the two last Relations seem less to favour the Chymists than Aristotle, who Image 193 (page 364)would have Metals Generated of certain Halitus or steams, the foremention'd Observations together, make it seem more Likely that the mineral Earths or those Metalline steams (wherewith probably such Earths are plentifully imbu'd) do contain in them some seminal Rudiment, or some thing Equivalent thereunto; by whose plastick power the rest of the matter, though perhaps Terrestrial and heavy, is in Tract of time fashion'd into this or That metalline Ore; almost as I formerly noted, that fair water was by the seminal Principle of Mint, Pompions, and other Vegetables, contriv'd into Bodies answerable to such Seeds. And that such Alterations of Terrestrial matter are not impossible, seems evident from that notable Practice of the Boylers of Salt-Petre, who unanimously observe, as well here in England as in other Countries; That if an Earth pregnant with Nitre be depriv'd, by the affusion of water, of all its true and dissoluble Salt, yet the Earth will after some years yield them Salt-Petre again; For which reason some of the eminent and skillfullest of them keep it in heaps as a perpetual Page 365Mine of Salt Petre; whence it may appear, that the Seminal Principle of Nitre latent in the Earth does by degrees Transforme the neighbouring matter into a Nitrous Body; for though I deny that some Volatile Nitre may by such Earths be attracted (as they speak) out of the Air, yet that the innermost parts of such great heaps that lye so remote from the Air should borrow from it all the Nitre they abound with, is not probable, for other reasons besides the remoteness of the Air, though I have not the Leasure to mention them. And I remember, that a personof Great Credit, and well acquainted with the wayes of making Vitriol, affirm'd to me, that he had observ'd, that a kind of mineral which abounds in that Salt, being kept within Doors and not expos'd (as is usual) to the free Air and Rains, did of it self in no very long time turn into Vitriol, not only in the outward or superficial, but even in the internal and most Central parts. And I also remember, that I met with a certain kind of Merkasite that lay together in great Quantities under Image 194 (page 366)ground, which did, even in my chamber, in so few hours begin of it self to turne into Vitriol, that we need not distrust the newly recited narrative. But to return to what I was saying of Nitre; as Nature made this Salt-Petre out of the once almost and inodorous Earth it was bred in, and did not find a very stinking and corrosive Acid Liquor, and a sharp Alcalyzate Salt to compound it of, though these be the Bodies into which the Fire dissolves it; so it were not necessary that Nature should make up all Metals and other Minerals of Pre-existent Salt, and Sulphur, and Mereury, though such Bodies might by Fire be obtained from it. Which one consideration duly weigh'd is very considerable in the present controversy: And to this agree well the Relations of our two German Chymists; for besides that it cannot be convincingly prov'd, it is not so much as likely that so languid and moderate a heat as that within the Mines, should carry up to so great a heat, though in the forme of fumes, Salt, Sulphur and Mercury; since we find in our Distillations, that it requires a considerable Degree of Fire to raise so much as to the height of one Page 367foot not only Salt, but even Mercury it self, in close Vessels. And if it be objected, that it seems by the stink that is sometimes observ'd when Lightening falls down here below, that sulphureous steams may ascend very high without any extraordinary Degree of heat; It may be answer'd, among other things, that the Sulphur of Silver is by Chymists said to be a fixt Sulphur, though not altogether so well Digested as that of Gold. But, proceeds Carneades, If it had not been to afford You some hints concerning the Origine of Metals, I need not have deduc'd any thing from these Observations; It not being necessary to the Validity of my Argument that my Deductions from them should be irrefragable, because my Adversaries the Aristotelians and Vulgar Chymists do not, I presume, know any better then I, a priori, of what ingredients Nature compounds Metals and Minerals. For their Argument to prove that those Bodies are made up of such Principles, is drawn a posteriori; I mean from this, that upon the Analysis of Mineral bodies they are resolv'd into those differing substances. Image 195 (page 368)That we may therefore examine this Argument, Let us proceed to consider what can be alledg'd in behalf of the E. lements from the Resolutions of Bodies by the fire; which you remember was the second Tophick whence I told you the Arguments of my Adversaries were desum'd. And that I may first dispatch what I have to say concerning Minerals, I will begin the remaining part of my discourse with considering how the fire divides them. And first, I have partly noted above, that though Chymists pretend from some to draw salt, from others running Mercury, and from others a Sulphur; Yet they have not hitherto taught us by any way in us among them to separate any one principle, whether Salt, Sulphur, or Mercury, from all sorts of Minerals without exception. And thence I may be allow'd to conclude that there is not any of the Elements that is an Ingredient of all Bodies, since there are some of which it is not so. In the next place, supposing that either Sulphur or Mercury were obtainable from all sorts of Minerals. Yet still this Page 369Sulphur or Mercury would be but a compounded, not an Elementary body, as I told you already on another occasion. And certainly he that takes notice of the wonderful Operations of Quicksilver, whether it be common, or drawn from Mineral Bodies, can scarce be so inconsiderate as to think it of the very same nature with that immature and fugitive substance which in Vegetables and Animals Chymists have been pleas'd to call their Mercury. So that when Mercury is got by the help of the fire out of a metal or other Mineral Body, if we will not suppose that it was not pre-existent in it, but produc'd by the action of the fire upon the Concrete, we may at least suppose this Quicksilver to have been a perfect Body of its own kind (though perhaps lesse heterogeneous then more secundary mixts) which happen'd to be mingl'd per minima, and coagulated with the other substances, whereof the Metal or Mineral consisted. As may be exemplyfied partly by Native Vermillion wherein the Quicksilver and Sulphur being exquisitely blended both with one another, and that other course Mineral stuff (what ever it be) that harbours Image 196 (page 370)them, make up a red body differing enough from both; and yet from which part of the Quicksilver, and of the Sulphur, may be easily enough obtain'd; Partly by those Mines wherein nature has so curiously incorporated Silver with Lead, that 'tis extreamly difficult, and yet possible, to separate the former out of the Latter. And partly too by native Vitriol, wherein the Metalline Corpuscles are by skill and industry separable from the saline ones, though they be so con-coagulated with them, that the whole Concrete is reckon'd among Salts. And here I further observe, that I never could see any Earth or Water, properly so call'd, separated from either Gold or Silver (to name now no other Metalline Bodies) and therefore to retort the argument upon my Adversaries, I may conclude, that since there are some bodies in which, for ought appears, there is neither Earth nor Water. I may be allow'd to conclude that neither of those two is an Universal Ingredient of all those Bodies that are counted perfectly mixt, which I desire you would remember against Anon. Page 371 It may indeed be objected, that the reason why from Gold or Silver we cannot separate any moisture, is, because that when it is melted out of the Oare, the vehement Fire requisite to its Fusion forc'd away all the aqueous and fugitive moisture; and the like fire may do from the materials of Glass. To which I shall Answer, that I Remember I read not long since in the Learned Josephus Acosta, who relates it upon his own observation; that in America, Acesta Natural. and Moral history of the Indies, L. 3. c. 5, P. 212. (where he long lived) there is a kind of Silver which the Indians call Papas, and sometimes (sayes he) they find pieces very fine and pure like to small round roots, the which is rare in that metal, but usuall in Gold; Concerning which metal he tells us, that besides this they find some which they call Gold in grains, which he tells us are small morsels of Gold that they find whole without mixture of any other metal, which hath no need of melting or Refining in the fire. I remember that a very skilful and credible person affirmed to me, that being in the Hungarian mines he had the good fortune to see a mineral that was Image 197 (page 372)there digg'd up, wherein pieces of Gold of the length, and also almost of the bigness of a humane Finger, grew in the Oar, as if they had been parts and Branches of Trees. And I have my self seen a Lump of whitish Mineral, that was brought as a Rarity to a Great and knowing Prince, wherein there grew here and there in the Stone, which looked like a kind of sparr, divers little Lumps of fine Gold, (for such I was assured that Tryal had manifested it to be) some of them Seeming to be about the Bigness of pease. But that is nothing to what our Acosta subjoynes, which is indeed very memorable, namely, that of the morsels of Native and pure Gold, which we lately heard him mentioning he had now and then seen some that weighed many pounds; to which I shall add, that I my self have seen a Lump of Oar not long since digged up, See Acosla in the fore-cited Place, and the passage of Pliny quoted by him. in whose stony part there grew, almost like Trees, divers parcels though not of Gold, yet of (what perhaps Mineralists will more wonder at) another Metal which seemed to be very pure or unmixt Page 373with any Heterogeneous Substances, and were some of them as big as my Finger, if not bigger. But upon Observations of this kind, though perhaps I could, yet I must not at present dwell any longer. To proceed Therefore now (sayes Carneades) to the Consideration of the Analysis of Vegetables, although my Tryals give me no cause to doubt but that out of most of them five differing Substances may be obtain'd by the fire, yet I think it will not be so easily Demonstrated that these deserve to be call'd Elements in the Notion above explain'd. And before I descend to particulars, I shall repeat and premise this General Consideration, that these differing substances that are call'd Elements or Principles, differ not from each other as Metals, Plants and Animals, or as such Creatures as are immediately produc'd each by its peculiar Seed, and Constitutes a distinct propagable sort of Creatures in the Universe; but these are only Various Schemes of matter or Substances that differ from each other, but in consistence (as Running Mercury and Image 198 (page 174)the same Metal congeal'd by the Vapor of Lead) and some very few other accidents, as Tast, or Smel, or Inflamability, or the want of them. So that by a change of Texture not impossible to be wrought by the Fire and other Agents that have the Faculty not only to dissociate the smal parts of Bodies, but afterwards to connect them after a new manner, the same parcell of matter may acquire or lose such accidents as may suffice to Denominate it Salt, or Sulphur, or Earth. If I were fully to clear to you my apprehensions concerning this matter, I should perhaps be obliged to acquaint you with divers of the Conjectures (for I must yet call them no more) I have had Concerning the Principles of things purely Corporeal: For though because I seem not satisfi'd with the Vulgar Doctrines, either of the Peripatetick or Paracelsian Schools, many of those that know me, (and perhaps, among Them, Eleutherius himself) have thought me wedded to the Epicurean Hypotheses, (as others have mistaken me for an Helmontian;) yet if you knew how little Conversant I have been with Epicurean Page 375Authors, and how great a part of Lucretius himself I never yet had the Culiosity to read, you would perchance be of another mind; especially if I were to entertain you at large, I say not, of my present Notions; but of my former thoughts concerning the Principles of things. But, as I said above, fully to clear my Apprehensions would require a Longer Discourse than we can now have. For, I should tell you that I have sometimes thought it not unfit, that to the Principles which may be assign'd to things, as the World is now Constituted, we should, if we consider the Great Mass of matter as it was whilst the Universe was in making, add another, which may Conveniently enough be call'd an Architectonick Principle or power; by which I mean those Various Determinations, and that Skilfull Guidance of the motions of the small parts of the Universal matter by the most wise Author of things, which were necessary at the beginning to turn that confus'd Chaos into this Orderly and beautifull World; and Especially, to contrive the Bodies of Animals Image 199 (page 376)and Plants, and the Seeds of those things whose kinds were to be propagated. For I confess I cannot well Conceive, how from matter, Barely put into Motion, and then left to it self, there could Emerge such Curious Fabricks as the Bodies of men and perfect Animals, and such yet more admirably Contriv'd parcels of matter, as the seeds of living Creatures. I should likewise tell you upon what grounds, and in what sence, I suspected the Principles of the World, as it now is, to be Three, Matter, Motion and Rest. I say, as the World now is, because the present Fabrick of the Universe, and especially the seeds of things, together with the establisht Course of Nature, is a Requisite or Condition, upon whose account divers things may be made out by our three Principles, which otherwise would be very hard, if possible, to explicate. I should moreover declare in general (for I pretend not to be able to do it otherwise) not only why I Conceive that Colours, Odors, Tasts, Fluidness and Solidity, and those other qualities that Diversifie and Denominate Bodies Page 377may Intelligibly be Deduced from these three; but how two of the Three Epicurean Principles (which, I need not tell, you are Magnitude, Figure and Weight) are Themselves Deducible from Matter and Motion; since the Latter of these Variously Agitating, and, as it were, Distracting the Former, must needs disjoyne its parts; which being Actually separated must Each of them necessarily both be of some Size, and obtain some shape or other. Nor did I add to our Principles the Aristotelean Privation, partly for other Reasons, which I must not now stay to insist on; and partly because it seems to be rather an Antecedent, or a Terminus a quo, then a True Principle, as the starting-Post is none of the Horses Legs or Limbs. I should also explain why and how I made rest to be, though not so considerable a Principle of things, as Motion, yet a Principle of them; partly because it is (for ought we know as Ancient at least as it, and depends not upon Motion, nor any other quality of matter; and partly, because it may enable the Body in which it happens to be, Image 200 (page 378)both to continue in a State of Rest till some external force put it out of that state, and to concur to the production of divers Changes in the bodies that hit against it, by either quite stopping or lessning their Motion (whilst the body formerly at Rest Receives all or part of it into it self) or else by giving a new Byass, or some other Modification, to Motion, that is, To the Grand and Primary instrument whereby Nature produces all the Changes and other Qualities that are to be met with in the World. I should likewise, after all this, explain to you how, although Matter, Motion and Rest, seem'd to me to be the Catholick Principles of the Universe, I thought the Principles of Particular bodies might be Commodiously enough reduc'd to two, namely Matter, and (what Comprehends the two other, and their effects) the result or Aggregate of those Accidents, which are the Motion or Rest, (for in some Bodies both are not to be found) the Bigness, Figure, Texture) and the thence resulting Qualities of the small parts) which are necessary to intitle the Body whereto they Page 379belong to this or that Peculiar Denomination; and discriminating it from others to appropriate it to a Determinate Kind of Things, as Yellowness, Fixtness, such a Degree of Weight, and of Ductility, do make the Portion of matter wherein they Concur, to be reckon'd among perfect metals, and obtain the name of Gold.) Which Aggregate or result of Accidents you may, if You please, call either Structure or Texture. Though indeed, that do not so properly Comprehend the motion of the constituent parts especially in case some of them be Fluid, or what other appellation shall appear most Expressive. Or if, retaining the Vulgar Terme, You will call it the Forme of the thing it denominates, I shall not much oppose it; Provided the word be interpreted to mean but what I have express'd, and not a Scholastick Substantial Forme, which so many intelligent men profess to be to them altogether Un-intelligible. But, sayes Carneades, if you remember that 'tis a Sceptick speaks to you, and that 'tis not so much my present Talk Image 201 (page 380)to make assertions as to suggest doubts, I hope you will look upon what I have propos'd, rather as a Narrative of my former conjectures touching the principles of things, then as a Resolute Declaration of my present opinions of them; especially since although they cannot but appear Very much to their Disadvantage, If you Consider Them as they are propos'd without those Reasons and Explanations by which I could perhaps make them appear much lesse extravagant; yet I want time to offer you what may be alledg'd to clear and countenance these notions; my design in mentioning them unto you at present being, partly, to bring some Light and Confirmation to divers passages of my discourse to you; partly to shew you, that I do not (as you seem to have suspected) embrace all Epicurus his principles; but Dissent from him in some main things, as well as from Aristotle and the Chymists, in others; & partly also, or rather chiefly, to intimate to you the grounds upon which I likewise differ from Helmont in this, that whereas he ascribes almost all things, and even diseases themselves, to their determinate Seeds; I am of opinion, that Page 381besides the peculiar Fabricks of the Bodies of Plants and Animals (and perhaps also of some Metals and Minerals) which I take to be the Effects of seminal principles, there are many other bodies in nature which have and deserve distinct and Proper names, but yet do but result from such contextures of the matter they are made of, as may without determinate seeds be effected by heat, cold, artificial mixtures and compositions, and divers other causes which sometimes nature imployes of her own accord; and oftentimes man by his power and skill makes use of to fashion the matter according to his Intentions. This may be exemplified both in the productions of Nature, and in those of Art; of the first sort I might name multitudes; but to shew how sleight a variation of Textures without addition of new ingredients may procure a parcel of matter divers names, and make it be Lookt upon as Different Things; I shall invite you to observe with me, That Clouds, Rain, Hail, Snow, Froth, and Ice, may be but water, having its parts varyed as to their size and distance in respect of each other, and as to motion Image 202 (page 383)and rest. And among Artificial Productions we may take notice (to skip the Crystals of Tartar) of Glass, Regulus, Martis-Stellatus, and particularly of the Sugar of Lead, which though made of that insipid Metal and sour salt of Vinager, has in it a sweetnesse surpassing that of common Sugar, and divers other qualities, which being not to be found in either of its two ingredients, must be confess'd to belong to the Concrete it self, upon the account of its Texture. This Consideration premis'd, it will be, I hope, the more easie to perswade you that the Fire may as well produce some new textures in a parcel of matter, as destroy the old. Wherefore hoping that you have not forgot the Arguments formerly imploy'd against the Doctrine of the Tria prima; namely that the Salt, Sulphur and Mercury, into which the Fire seems to resolve Vegetable and Animal Bodies, are yet compounded, not simple and Elementary Substances; And that (as appeared by the Experiment of Pompions) the Tria prima may be made out of Water; hoping I say, that you remember These and the other Things that I formerly represented Page 382to the same purpose, I shall now add only, that if we doubt not the Truth of some of Helmonts Relation, We may well doubt whether any of these Heterogeneities be (I say not pre-existent, so as to convene together, when a plant or Animal is to be constituted but) so much as in-existent in the Concrete whence they are obtain'd, when the Chymists first goes about to resolve it; For, not to insist upon the un-inflamable Spirit of such Concretes, because that may be pretended to be but a mixture of Phlegme and Salt; the Oyle or Sulphur of Vegetables or Animals is, according to him, reducible by the help of Lixiviate Salts into Sope; as that Sope is by the help of repeated Distillations from a Caput Mortuum of Chalk into insipid Water. And as for the saline substance that seems separable from mixt bodies; Omne autem Alcali additae pinguedine in aqueum liquorem, qui tandem mera & simplex aqua fit, reducitur, (ut videre est in Sapone, Lazurio lapide, &c.) quoties per adjuncta fixa semen Pinguedinis deponit. Helmont. the same Helmonts tryals give us cause to think, That it may be a production of the Fire, which by transporting and otherwise altering the particles of the matter, does bring it to a Saline nature. Image 203 (page 384) For I know (sayes he, in the place formerly alledg'd to another purpose) a way to reduce all stones into a meer Salt of equal weight with the stone whence it was produc'd, and that without any of the least either Sulphur or Mercury; which asseveration of my Author would perhaps seem less incredible to You, if I durst acquaint You with all I could say upon that subject. And hence by the way you may also conclude that the Sulphur and Mercury, as they call them, that Chymists are wont to obtain from compound Bodies by the Fire, may possibly in many Cases be the productions of it; since if the same bodies had been wrought upon by the Agents employ'd by Helmont, they would have yielded neither Sulphur nor Mercury; and those portions of them which the Fire would have presented Us in the forme of Sulphureous and Mercurial Bodies would have, by Helmonts method, been exhibited to us in the form of Salt. But though (sayes Eleutherius) You have alledg'd very plausible Arguments against the tria Prima, yet I see not how it will be possible for you to avoid acknowledging that Earth and Water are Page 385Elementary Ingredients, though not of Mineral Concretes, yet of all Animal and Vegetable Bodies; Since if any of these of what sort soever be committed to Distillation, there is regularly and constantly separated from it a phlegme or aqueous part and a Caput Mortuum or Earth. I readily acknowledged (answers Carneades) it is not so easy to reject Water and Earth (and especially the former) as 'tis to reject the Tria Prima, from being the Elements of mixt Bodies; but 'tis not every difficult thing that is impossible. I consider then, as to Water, that the chief Qualities which make men give that name to any visible Substance, are, that it is Fluid or Liquid, and that it is insipid and inodorous. Now as for the tast of these qualities, I think you have never seen any of those separated substances that the Chymists call Phlegme which was perfectly devoyd both of Tast and Smell: and if you object, that yet it may be reasonably suppos'd, that since the whole Body is Liquid, the mass is nothing but Elementary Water faintly imbu'd with some of the Saline or Sulphureous Image 204 (page 386)parts of the same Concrete, which it retain'd with it upon its Separation from the Other Ingredients. To this I answer, That this Objection would not appear so stong as it is plausible, if Chymists understood the Nature of Fluidity and Compactnesse; and that, as I formerly observ'd, to a Bodies being Fluid there is nothing necessary, but that it be divided into parts small enough; and that these parts be put into such a motion among themselves as to glide some this way and some that way, along each others Surfaces. So that, although a Concrete were never so dry, and had not any Water or other Liquor inexistent in it, yet such a Comminution of its parts may be made, by the fire or other Agents, as to turn a great portion of them into Liquor. Of this Truth I will give an instance, employ'd by our friend here present as one of the most conducive of his experiments to Illustrate the nature of Salts. If you Take, then, sea salt and melt it in the Fire to free it from the aqueous parts, and afterward distill it with a vehement Fire from burnt Clay, or any other, as dry a Caput mortuum as you please, you will, as Chymists confess, Page 387by teaching it drive over a good part of the Salt in the form of a Liquor. And to satisfy some ingenious men, That a great part of this Liquor was still true sea salt brought by the Operation of the Fire into Corpuscles so small, and perhaps so advantageously shap'd, as to be capable of the forme of a Fluid Body, He did in my presence poure to such spititual salts a due proportion of the spirit (or salt and Phlegme) of Urine, whereby having evaporated the superfluous moisture, he soon obtain'd such another Concrete, both as to tast and smell, and easie sublimableness as common Salt Armoniack, which you know is made up of grosse and undistill'd sea salt united with the salts of Urine and of Soot, which two are very neer of kin to each other. And further, to manifest that the Corpuscles of sea salt and the Saline ones of Urine retain their several Natures in this Concrete, He mixt it with a convenient quantity of Salt of Tartar, and committing it to Distillation soon regain'd his spirit of Urine in a liquid form by its self, the Sea salt staying behind with the Salt of Tartar. Wherefore it is very possible that dry Bodies may by the Fire be reduc'd Image 205 (page 388)to Liquors without any separation of Elements, but barely by a certain kind of Dissipation and Comminution of the matter, whereby its parts are brought into a new state. And if it be still objected, that the Phlegme of mixt Bodies must be reputed water, because so weak a tast needs but a very small proportion of Salt to impart it; It may be reply'd, that for ought appears, common Salt and divers other bodies, though they be distill'd never so dry, and in never so close Vessels, will yield each of them pretty store of a Liquor, wherein though (as I lately noted) Saline Corpuscles abound, Yet there is besides a large proportion of Phlegme, as may easily be discovered by coagulating the Saline Corpuseles with any convenient Body; as I lately told you, our Friend coagulated part of the Spirit of Salt with Spirit of Urine: and as I have divers times separated a salt from Oyle of Vitriol it self (though a very ponderous Liquor and drawn from a saline body) by boyling it with a just quantity of Mercury, and then washing the newly coagulated salt from the Precipitate with fair Water. Now to what can we more probably ascribe this plenty Page 389of aqueous Substance afforded us by the Distillation of such bodies, than unto this, That among the various operations of the Fire upon the matter of a Concrete, divers particles of that matter are reduc'd to such a shape and bignesse as is requisite to compose such a Liquor as Chymists are wont to call Phlegme or Water. How I conjecture this change may be effected, 'tis neither necessary for me to tell you, nor possible to do so without a much longer discourse then were now seasonable. But I desire you would with me reflect upon what I formerly told you conterning the change of Quicksilver into Water; For that Water having but a very faint tast, if any whit more than divers of those liquors that Chymists referr to Phlegme; By that experiment it seems evident, that even a metalline body, and therefore much more such as are but Vegetable or Animal, may by a simple operation of the Fire be turn'd in great part into Water. And since those I dispute with are not yet able out of Gold, or Silver, or divers other Concretes to separate any thing like Water; I hope I may be allow'd to conclude against Them, that water it self is not an Image 206 (page 390)Universal and pre-existent Ingredient of Mixt Bodies. But as for those Chymists that, Supposing with me the Truth of what Helmont relates of the Alkahest's wonderful Effects, have a right to press me with his Authority concerning them, and to alledge that he could Transmute all reputedly mixt Bodies into insipid and meer Water; To those I shall represent, That though his Affirmations conclude strongly against the Vulgar Chymists (against whom I have not therefore scrupl'd to Employ Them) since they Evince that the Commonly reputed Principles or Ingredients of Things are not Permanent and indestructible, since they may be further reduc'd into Insipid Phlegme differing from them all; Yet till we can be allow'd to examine this Liquor, I think it not unreasonable to doubt whether it be not something else then meer Water. For I find not any other reason given by Helmont of his Pronouncing it so, then that it is insipid. Now Sapour being an Accident or an Affection of matter that relates to our Tongue, Palate, and other Organs of Tast, it may very possibly be, Page 391that the small Parts of a Body may be of such a Size and Shape, as either by their extream Littleness, or by their slenderness, or by their Figure, to be unable to pierce into and make a perceptible Impression upon the Nerves or Membranous parts of the Organs of Tast, and what may be fit to work otherwise upon divers other Bodies than meer Water can, and consequently to Disclose it self to be of a Nature farr enough from Elementary. In Silke dyed Red or of any other Colour, whilst many Contiguous Threads makes up a skein, the Colour of the Silke is conspicuous; but if only a very few of them be lookt upon, the Colour will appear much fainter then before. But if You take out one simple Thread, you shall not easily be able to discern any Colour at all; So subtile an Object having not the Force to make upon the Optick Nerve an Impression great enough to be taken Notice of. It is also observ'd, that the best sort of Oyl-Olive is almost tastless, and yet I need not tell you how exceedingly distant in Nature Oyle is from VVater. The Liquor into which I told you, upon the Relation of Lully, Image 207 (page 392)and Eye-witness that Mercury might be Transmuted, has sometimes but a very Languid, if any Tast, and yet its Operations even upon some Mineral Bodies are very peculiar. Quicksilver it self also, though the Corpuscles it consists of be so very small as to get into the Pores of that Closest and compactest of Bodies, Gold, is yet (you know) altogether Tastless. And our Helmont several times tells us, that fair Water wherein a little Quantity f Quicksilver has lain for some time, though it acquire no certain Tast or other sensible Quality from the Quicksilver; Yet it has a power to destroy wormes in humane Bodies; which he does much, but not causelessly extoll. And I remember, a great Lady, that had been Eminent for her Beauty in Divers Courts, confess'd to me, that this insipid Liquor was of all innocent washes for the Face the best that she ever met with. And here let me conclude my Discourse, concerning such waters or Liquors as I have hitherto been examining, with these two Considerations. VVhereof the first is, That by reason of our being wont to drink nothing but Page 393VVine, Bear, Cyder, or other strongly tasted Liquors, there may be in several of these Liquors, that are wont to pass for insipid Phlegme, very peculiar and Distinct, Tasts though unheeded (and perhaps not to be perceiv'd) by Us. For to omit what Naturalists affirm of Apes, (and which probably may be true of divers other Animals) that they have a more exquisite palate than Men: among Men themselves, those that are wont to drink nothing but water may (as I have try'd in my self) Discern very sensibly a great Difference of Tasts in several waters, which one un-accustomed to drink water would take to be all alike insipid. And this is the first of my two Considerations; the Other is, That it is not impossible that the Corpuscles into which a body is dissipated by the Fire may by the Operation of the same fire have their figures so altered, or may be by associations with one another brought into little Masses of such a Size and Shape, as not to be fit to make sensible Impressions on the Tongue. And that you may not think such alterations impossible, be pleased to consider with me; that not Image 208 (page 394)only the sharpest Spirit of Vinager having dissolved as much Corall as it can, will Coagulate with it into a Substance, which though soluble in water, like salt, is incomparably less strongly Tasted then the Vinager was before; but (what is more considerable) though the Acid salts that are carried up with Quicksilver in the preparation of common sublimate are so sharp, that being moistened with water it will Corrode some of the Metals themselves; yet this Corrosive Sublimate being twice or thrice re-sublim'd with a full proportion of insipid Quicksilver, Constitutes (as you know) that Factitious Concrete, which the Chymists call Mercurius dulcis; not because it is sweet, but because the sharpness of the Corrosive Salts is so taken away by their Combination with the Mercurial Corpuscles, that the whole mixture when it is prepar'd is judg'd to be insipid. And thus (continues Carneades) having given you some Reasons why I refuse to admit Elementary water for a constant Ingredient of Mixt Bodies, It will be easie for me to give you an Account why I also reject Earth. Page 395 For first, it may well be suspected that many Substances pass among Chymists under the name of Earth, because, like it, they are Dry, and Heavy, and Fixt, which yet are very farr from an Elementary Nature. This you will not think improbable, If you recall to mind what I formerly told you concerning what Chymists call the Dead Earth of things, and especially touching the copper to be drawn from the Caput Mortuum of Vitriol; And if also you allow me to subjoyn a casual but memorable Experiment made by Johannes Agricola upon the Terra Damnata of Brimstone. Our Author then tells us (in his notes upon Popius,) that in the year 1621 he made an Oyle of Sulphur; the remaining Faeces he reverberated in a moderate Fire fourteen dayes; afterwards he put them well luted up in a VVind Oven, and gave them a strong Fire for six hours, purposing to calcine the Faeces to a perfect Whiteness, that he might make someting else out of them. But coming to break the pot, he found above but very little Faeces, and those Grey and not White; but beneath there lay a fine Red Regulus Image 209 (page 396)which he first marvell'd at and knew not what to make of, being well assured that not the least thing, besides the Faeces of the Sulphur, came into the pot; and that the Sulphur it self had only been dissolv'd in Linseed Oyle; this Regulus he found heavy and malleable almost as Lead; having caus'd a Goldsmith to draw him a Wire of it, he found it to be of the Fairest copper, and so rightly colour'd, that a Jew of Prague Offer'd him a great price for it. And of this Metal he sayes he had 12 loth (or six ounces) out of one pound of Ashes or Faeces. And this Story may well incline us to suspect that since the Caput Mortuum of the Sulphur was kept so long in the fire before it was found to be any thing else then a Terra damnata, there may be divers other Residences of Bodies which are wont to pass only for the Terrestrial Faeces of things, and therefore to be thrown away as soon as the Distillation or Calcination of the Body that yielded them is ended; which yet if they were long and Skilfully examin'd by the fire would appear to be differing from Elementary Earth. And I have taken notice of the Page 397unwarrantable forwardness of common Chymists to pronounce things useless Faeces, by observing how often they reject the Caput Mortuum of Verdegrease; which is yet so farr from deserving that Name, that not only by strong fires and convenient Additaments it may in some hours be reduc'd into copper, but with a certain Flux Powder I sometimes make for Recreation, I have in two or three minutes obtain'd that Metal from it. To which I may add, that having for tryall sake kept Venetian Taclk in no less a heat than that of a glass Furnace, I found after all the Brunt of the fire it had indur'd, the remaining Body though brittle and discolour'd, had not lost very much of its former Bulke, and seem'd still to be nearer of kin to Talck than to meer Earth. And I remember too, that a candid Mineralist, famous for his Skill in trying of Oars, requesting me one day to procure him a certain American Mineral Earth of a Virtuoso, who he thought would not refuse me; I enquir'd of him why he seem'd so greedy of it: he confess'd to me that this Gentleman having brought that Earth to the publick Say-Masters; Image 210 (page 398)and they upon their being unable by any means to bring it to fusion or make it fly away, he (the Relator) had procur'd a little of it; and having try'd it with a peculiar Flux separated from it neer a third part of pure Gold; so great mistakes may be committed in hastily concluding things to be Uselesse Earth. Next, it may be suppos'd, That as in the Resolution of Bodies by the Fire some of the dissipated Parts may, by their various occursion occasion'd by the heat, be brought to stick together so closely as to constitute Corpuscles too heavy for the Fire to carry away; the aggregate of which Corpuscles is wont to be call'd Ashes or Earth; So other Agents may resolve the Concrete into Minute Parts, after so differing a manner as not to produce any Caput mortuum, or dry and heavy Body. As you may remember Helmont above inform'd us, that with his great Dissolvent he divided a Coal into two liquid and volatile Bodies, aequiponderant to the Coal, without any dry or fixt Residence at all. And indeed, I see not why it should be necessary that all Agents that resolve Page 399Bodies into portions of differingly qualifi'd matter must work on them the same way, and divide them into just such parts, both for nature and Number, as the Fire dissipates them into. For since, as I noted before, the Bulk and shape of the small Parts of bodies, together with their Fitness and Unfitness to be easily put into Motion, may make the liquors or other substances such Corpuscles compose, as much to differ from each other as do some of the Chymical principles: Why may not something happen in this case, not unlike what is usuall in the grosser divisions of bodies by Mechanical Instruments? Where we see that some Tools reduce Wood, for Instance, into darts of several shapes, bignesse, and other qualities, as Hatchets and Wedges divide it into grosser parts; some more long and slender, as splinters; and some more thick and irregular, as chips; but all of considerable bulk; but Files and Saws makes a Comminution of it into Dust; which, as all the others, is of the more solid sort of parts; whereas others divide it into long and broad, but thin and flexible parts, as do Planes: And of this kind of parts it self there is also a Image 211 (page 400)variety according to the Difference of the Tools employ'd to work on the Wood; the shavings made by the plane being in some things differing from those shives or thin and flexible pieces of wood that are obtain'd by Borers, and these from some others obtainable by other Tools. Some Chymical Examples applicable to this purpose I have elsewhere given you. To which I may add, that whereas in a mixture of Sulphur and Salt of Tartar well melted and incorporated together, the action of pure spirit of wine digested on it is to separate the sulphureous from the Alcalizate Parts, by dissolving the former and leaving the latter, the action of Wine (probably upon the score of its copious Phlegme) upon the same mixture is to divide it into Corpuscles consisting of both Alcalizate and Sulphureous Parts united. And if it be objected, that this is but a Factitious Concrete; I answer, that however the instance may serve to illustrate what I propos'd, if not to prove it; and that Nature her self doth in the bowels of the Earth make Decompounded Bodies, as we see in Vitriol, Cinnaber, and even in Sulphur it self; I will not urge that Page 401the Fire divides new Milk into five differing Substances; but Runnet and Acid Liquors divide it into a Coagulated matter and a thin Whey: And on the other side churning divides it into Butter and Butter-milk, which may either of them be yet reduc'd to other substances differing from the former. I will not presse this, I say, nor other instances of this Nature, because I cannot in few words answer what may be objected, that these Concretes sequestred without the help of the Fire may by it be further divided into Hypostatical Principles. But I will rather represent, That whereas the same spirit of Wine will dissociare the Parts of Camphire, and make them one Liquor with it self; Aqua Fortis will also disjoyn them, and put them into motion; but so as to keep them together, and yet alter their Texture into the form of an Oyle. I know also an uncompounded Liquor, that an extraordinary Chymist would not allow to be so much as Saline, which doth (as I have try'd) from Coral it self (as fixt as divers judicious writers assert that Concrete to be) not only obtain a noble Tincture, without the Intervention of Nitre or other Image 212 (page 402)Salts; but will carry over the Tincture in Distillation. And if some reasons did not forbid me, I could now tell you of a Menstruum I make my self, that doth more odly dissociate the parts of Minerals very fixt in the fire. So that it seems not incredible, that there may be some Agent or way of Operation found, whereby this or that Concrete, if not all Firme Bodies, may be resolv'd into parts so very minute and so unapt to stick close to one another, that none of them may be fixt enough to stay behind in a strong Fire, and to be incapable of Distillation; nor consequently to be look'd upon as Earth. But to return to Helmont, the same Authour somewhere supply's me with another Argument against the Earth's being such an Element as my Adversaries would have it. For he somewhere affirms, that he can reduce all the Terrestrial parts of mixt bodies into infipid water; whence we may argue against the Earths being one of their Elements, even from that Notion of Elements which you may remember Philoponus recited out of Aristotle himself, when he lately disputed for his Chymists against Themistius. And here we may Page 403on this occasion consider, that since a Body from which the Fire hath driven away its looser parts is wont to be look'd upon as Earth, upon the Account of its being endow'd with both these qualities, Tastlessenesse and Fixtnesse, (for Salt of Tartar though Fixt passes not among the Chymists for Earth, because 'tis strongly Tasted) if it be in the power of Natural Agents to deprive the Caput Mortuum of a body of either of those two Qualities, or to give them both to a portion of matter that had them not both before, the Chymists will not easily define what part of a resolv'd Concrete is earth, and make out, that that Earth is a primary, simple, and indestructible Body. Now there are some cases wherein the more skilful of the Vulgar Chymists themselves pretend to be able, by repeated Cohobations and other fit Operations, to make the Distilled parts of a Concrete bring its own Caput Mortuum over the Helme, in the forme of a Liquor; in which state being both Fluid and Volatile, you will easily believe it would not be taken for Earth. And indeed by a skilful, but not Vulgar, way of managing some Concretes, there may be more effected Image 213 (page 404)in this kind, then you perhaps would easily think. And on the other side, that either Earth may be Generated, or at least Bodies that did not before appear to be neer Totally Earth, may be so alter'd as to pass for it, seems very possible, if Helmont have done that by Art which he mentions in several places; Novi item modos quibus totum Salpetiae in terram convertitur, totumque Sulphur semel dissolutum fixetur in Pulvecrem terreum. Helmont in Compl. atque Mist. Elementor, Sect. 24. especially where He sayes that he knowes wayes whereby Sulphur once dissolv'd is all of it fix'd into a Terrestrial Powder, and the whole Bodie of Salt-Petre may be turn'd into Earth: Which last he elsewhere sayes is Done by the Odour only of a certain Sulphureous Fire. And in another place He mentions one way of doing this, which I cannot give you an Account of; because the Materialls I had prepar'd for Trying it, were by a Servants mistake unhappily thrown away. And these Last Arguments may be confirm'd by the Experiment I have often had occasion to mention concerning the Mint I produc'd out of Water. And partly by an Observation of Rondeletius Page 405concerning the Growth of Animals also, Nourish'd but by Water, which I remember'd not to mention, when I discours'd to you about the Production of things out of Water. Lib 1. cap. 2. This Diligent VVriter then in his instructive book of fishes, affirmes That his Wife kept a fish in a Glass of water without any other Food for three years; in which space it was constantly augmented, till at last it could not come out of the Place at which it was put in, and at length was too big for the glass it self though that were of a large capacity. And because there is no just reason to doubt, that this Fish, if Distill'd, would have yielded the like differing substances with other Animals: And However, because the Mint which I had out of water afforded me upon Distillation a good quantity of Charcoal, I think I may from thence inferr, that Earth it self may be produc'd out of Water; or if you please, that water may be transmuted into Earth; and consequently, that though it could be prov'd that Earth is an Ingredient actually in-existent in the Vegetable and Animal Bodies whence it may be obtain'd by Fire: yet it would Image 214 (page 406)not necessarily follow, that Earth as a pre-existent Element Does with other Principles convene to make up those Bodies whence it seems to have been separated. After all is said (sayes Eleutherius) I have yet something to Object, that I cannot but think considerable, since Carneades Himself alledg'd it as such; for, (continues Eleutherius smiling) I must make bold to try whether you can as luckily answer your own Arguments, as those of your Antagonists, I mean (pursues he) that part of your Concessions, wherein you cannot but remember that you supply'd your Adversaries with an Example to prove that there may be Elementary Bodies, by taking Notice that Gold may be an Ingredient in a multitude of differing Mixtures, and yet retain its Nature, notwithstanding all that the Chymists by their Fires and Corrosive Waters are able to do to Destroy it. I sufficiently intimated to you at that time (replies Carneades) that I propos'd this Example, chiefly to shew you how Nature may be Conceived to have made Elements, not to prove that she Page 407actually has made any; And you know, that a posse ad esse the Inference will not hold. But (continues Carneades) to answer more directly to the Objection drawn from Gold, I must tell You, that though I know very well that divers of the more sober Chymists have complain'd of the Vulgar Chymists, as of Mountebanks or Cheats, for pretending so vainly, as hitherto they have done, to Destroy Gold; Yet I know a certain Menstruum (which our Friend has made, and intends shortly to communicate to the Ingenious) of so piercing and powerfull a Quality, That if notwithstanding much care, and some skill, I did not much deceive my self, I have with it really destroy'd even refin'd Gold, and brought it into a Metalline Body of another colour and Nature, as I found by Tryals purposely made. And if some just Considerations did not for the present Forbid it, I could Perchance here shew you by another Experiment or Two of my own Trying, that such Menstruums may be made as to entice away and retain divers parts, from Bodies, which even the more Judicious and Experienc'd Spagyrists have pronounc'd Image 215 (page 408)irresoluble by the Fire. Though (which I Desire you would mark) in neither of these Instances, the Gold or Precious Stones be Analys'd into any of the Tria Prima, but only Reduc'd to new Concretes. And indeed there is a great Disparity betwixt the Operations of the several Agents whereby the Parts of a Body come to be Dissipated. As if (for Instance) you dissolve the purer sort of Vitriol in common Water, the Liquor will swallow up the Mineral, and so Dissociate its Corpuscles, that they will seem to make up but one Liquor with those of the water; and yet each of these Corpuscles retains its Nature and Texture, and remains a Vitriolate and Compounded Body. But if the same Vitriol be exposed to a strong Fire, it will then be divided not only, as before, into smaller parts, but into Heterogeneous Substances, each of the Vitriolate Corpuscles that remain'd entire in the water, being it self upon the Destruction of its former Texture dissipated or divided into new Particles of differing Qualities. But Instances more fitly applicable to this purpose, I have already given you. Wherefore to return Page 409to what I told you about the Destruction of Gold, that Experiment Invites me to Represent to you, that Though there were either Saline, or Sulphureous, or Terrestrial Portions of Matter, whose parts were so small, so firmly united together, or of a figure so fit to make them cohere to one another, (as we see that in quicksilver broken into little Globes, the Parts brought to touch one another do immediately re-imbody) that neither the Fire, nor the usual Agents employ'd by Chymists, are pierceing enough to divide their Parts, so as to destroy the Texture of the single Corpuscles; yet it would not necessarily follow, That such Permanent Bodies were Elementary, since tis possible there may be Agents found in Nature, some of whose parts may be of such a Size and Figure as to take better Hold of some parts of these seemingly Elementary Corpuscles than these parts do of the rest, and Consequently may carry away such parts with them, and so dissolve the Texture of the Corpuscle by pulling its parts asunder. And if it be said, that at least we may this way discover the Elementary Ingredients of Image 216 (page 410)Things, by observing into what Substances these Corpuscles that were reputed pure are divided; I answer, that it is not necessary that such a Discovery should be practicable. For if the Particles of the Dissolvent do take such firme hold of those of the Dissolved Body, they must constitute together new Bodies, as well as Destroy the Old; and the strickt Union, which according to this Hypothesis may well be suppos'd betwixt the Parts of the Emergent Body, will make it as Little to be Expected that they should be pull'd asunder, but by little Parts of matter, that to Divide them Associate Themselves and stick extreamly close to those of them which they sever from their Former Adherents. Besides that it is not impossible, that a Corpuscle suppos'd to be Elementary may have its Nature changed, without suffering a Divorce of its parts, barely by a new Texture Effected by some powerfull Agent; as I formerly told you, the same portion of matter may easily by the Operation of the Fire be turn'd at pleasure into the form of a Brittle and Transparent, or an Opacous and Malleable Body. Page 411 And indeed, if you consider how farr the bare Change of Texture, whether made by Art or Nature (or rather by Nature with or without the assistance of man) can go in producing such New Qualities in the same parcel of matter, and how many inanimate Bodies (such as are all the Chymical productions of the Fire) we know are Denominated and Distinguish'd not so much by any Imaginary Substantial Form, as by the aggregate of these Qualities. If you consider these Things, I say, and that the varying of either the figure, or the Size, or the Motion, or the Situation, or Connexion of the Corpuscles whereof any of these Bodies is compos'd, may alter the Fabrick of it, you will possibly be invited to suspect, with me, that there is no great need that Nature should alwayes have Elements before hand, whereof to make such Bodies as we call mixts. And that it is not so easie as Chymists and others have hitherto Imagin'd, to discern, among the many differing Substances that may without any extraordinary skill be obtain'd from the same portion of matter, Which ought to be esteemed exclusively to all the rest, Image 217 (page 412)its in-existent Elementary Ingredients; much lesse to determine what Primogeneal and Simple Bodies convened together to compose it. To exemplify this, I shall add to what I have already on several occasions Represented, but this single instance. You may remember (Eleutherius) that I formerly intimated to you, that besides Mint and Pompions, I produced divers other Vegetables of very differing Natures out of Water. Wherefore you will not, I presume, think it incongruous to suppose, that when a slender Vineslip is set into the ground, and takes root, there it may likewise receive its Nutriment from the water attracted out of the earth by his roots, or impell'd by the warm'th of the sun, or pressure of the ambient air into the pores of them. And this you will the more easily believe, if you ever observ'd what a strange quantity of Water will Drop out of a wound given to the Vine, in a convenient place, at a seasonable time in the Spring; and how little of Tast or Smell this Aqua Vitis, as Physitians call it, is endow'd with, notwithstanding what concoction or alteration it may receive in its passage Page 413through the Vine, to discriminate it from common Water. Supposing then this Liquor, at its first entrance into the roots of the Vine, to be common Water; Let Us a little consider how many various Substances may be obtain'd from it; though to do so, I must repeat somewhat that I had a former occasion to touch upon. And first, this Liquor being Digested in the plant, and assimilated by the several parts of it, is turn'd into the Wood, Bark, Pith, Leaves, &c. of the Vine; The same Liquor may be further dry'd, and fashon'd into Vine-buds, and these a while after are advanced unto sour Grapes, which express'd yield Verjuice, a Liquor very differing in several qualities both from Wine and other Liquors obtainable from the Vine: These soure Grapes being by the heat of the Sun concocted and ripened, turne to well tasted Grapes; Those if dry'd in the Sun and Distill'd, afford a faetid Oyle and a piercing Empyreumatical Spirit, but not a Vinous Spirit; These dry'd Grapes or Raisins boyl'd in a convenient proportion of Water make a sweet Liquor, which being betimes distill'd afford an Oyle and Spirit much like Image 218 (page 414)those of the Raisins themselves; If the juice of the Grapes be squeez'd out and put to Ferment, it first becomes a sweet and turbid Liquor, then grows lesse sweet and more clear, and then affords in common Distillations not an Oyle but a Spirit, which, though inflamable like Oyle, differs much from it, in that it is not fat, and that it will readily mingle with Water. I have likewise without Addition obtain'd in processe of time (and by an easie way which I am ready to teach you) from one of the noblest sorts of Wine, pretty store of pure and curiously figured Crystals of Salt, together with a great proportion of a Liquor as sweet almost as Hony; and these I obtained not from Must, but True and sprightly Wine; besides the Vinous Liquor, the fermented Juice of Grapes is partly turned into liquid Dregs or Leeze, and partly into that crust or dry feculancy that is commonly called Tartar; and this Tartar may by the Fire be easily divided into five differing substances; four of which are not Acid, and the other not so manifestly Acid as the Tartar it self; The same Vinous Juice after some time, especially if it be not carefully Page 415kept, Degenerates into that very sour Liquor called Vinegar; from which you may obtain by the Fire a Spirit and a Crystalline Salt differing enough from the Spirit and Lixiviate Salt of Tartar. And if you pour the Dephlegm'd Spirit of the Vinegar upon the Salt of Tartar, there will be produc'd such a Conflict or Ebullition as if there were scarce two more contrary Bodies in Nature; and oftentimes in this Vinager you may observe part of the matter to be turned into an innumerable company of swimming Animals, which our Friend having divers years ago observed, hath in one of his Papers taught us how to discover clearly without the help of a Microscope. Into all these various Schemes of matter, or differingly Qualifyed Bodies, besides divers others that I purposely forbear to mention, may the Water that is imbib'd by the roots of the Vine be brought, partly by the formative power of the plant, and partly by supervenient Agents or Causes, without the visible concurrence of any extraneous Ingredient; but if we be allowed to add to the Productions of this transmuted Water a sew other substances, we may much Image 219 (page 416)encrease the Variety of such Bodies; although in this second sort of Productions, the Vinous parts seem scarce to retain any thing of the much more fix'd Bodies wherewith they were mingl'd, but only to have by their Mixture with them acquir'd such a Disposition, that in their recess occasion'd by the Fire they came to be alter'd as to shape, or Bigness, or both, and associated after a New manner. Thus, as I formerly told you, I did by the Addition of a Caput Mortuum of Antimony, and some other Bodies unfit for Distillation, obtain from crude Tartar, store of a very Volatile and Crystalline Salt, differing very much in smell and other Qualities from the usuall salts of Tartar. But (sayes Eleutherius, interrupting him at these Words) if you have no restraint upon you, I would very gladly before you go any further, be more particularly inform'd, how you make this Volatile Salt, because (you know) that such Multitudes of Chymists have by a scarce imaginable Variety of wayes, attempted in Vain the Volatilization of the Salt of Tartar, that divers learned Spagyrists speak as if it were impossible, Page 417to make any thing out of Tartar, that shall be Volatile in a Saline Forme, or as some of them express it, in forma sicca. I am very farr from thinking (answers Carneades) that the Salt I have mention'd is that which Paracelsus and Helmont mean when they speak of Sal Tartari Volatile, and ascribe such great things to it. For the Salt I speak of falls extreamly short of those Virtues, not seeming in its Tast, Smel, and other Obvious Qualities, to differ very much (though something it do differ) from Salt of Harts-horn, and other Volatile Salts drawn from the Distill'd Parts of Animals. Nor have I yet made Tryals enough to be sure, that it is a pure Salt of Tartar without participating any thing at all of the Nitre, or Antimony. But because it seems more likely to proceed from the Tartar, than from any of the other Ingredients, and because the Experiment is in it self not Ignoble, and Luciferous enough (as shewing a new way to produce a Volatile Salt contrary to Acid Salts from Bodies that otherwise are Observ'd to yield no such Liquor, but either only, or chiefly, Acid ones,) I Image 220 (page 418)shall, to satisfie you, acquaint you before any of my other Friends with the way I now use (for I have formerly us'd some others) to make it. Take then of good Antimony, Salt-Petre and Tartar, of each an equal weight, and of Quicklime Halfe the Weight of any one of them; let these be powder'd and well mingl'd; this done, you must have in readiness a long neck or Retort of Earth, which must be plac'd in a Furnace for a naked Fire, and have at the top of it a hole of a convenient Bigness, at which you may cast in the Mixture, and presently stop it up again; this Vessel being fitted with a large Receiver must have Fire made under it, till the bottom of the sides be red hot, and then you must cast in the above prepar'd Mixture, by about halfe a spoonfull (more or less) at a time, at the hole made for that purpose; which being nimbly stopt, the Fumes will pass into the Receiver and condense there into a Liquor, that being rectifi'd will be of a pure golden Colour, and carry up that colour to a great height; this Spirit abounds in the Salt I told you of, part of which may easily enough be separated Page 419by the way I use in such cases, which is, to put the Liquor into a glass Egg, or bolthead with a long and narrow Neck. For if this be plac'd a little inclining in hot sand, there will sublime up a fine Salt, which, as I told you, I find to be much of kin to the Volatile Salts of Animals: For like them it has a Saltish, not an Acid Salt; it hisses upon the Affusion of Spirit of Nitre, or Oyle of Vitriol; it precipitates Corals Dissolv'd in Spirit of Vinager; it turnes the blew Syrup of Violets immediately green; it presently turnes the Solution of Sublimate into a Milkie whiteness; and in summ, has divers Operations like those that I have observ'd in that sort of Salts to which I have resembled it: and is so Volatile, that for Distinction sake, I call it Tartari Fugitivus. What virtues it may have in Physick I have not yet had the opportunity to Try; but I am apt to think they will not be despicable. And besides that a very Ingenious Friend of mine tells me he hath done great matters against the stone, with a Preparation not very much Differing from ours, a very Experienc'd Germane Chymist finding that I was Image 221 (page 420)unacquainted with the wayes of making this salt, told me that in a great City in his Country, a noted Chymist prizes it so highly, that he had a while since procur'd a Priviledge from the Magistrates, that none but He, or by his Licence, should vent a Spirit made almost after the same Way with mine, save that he leaves out one of the Ingredients, namely the Quick-lime. But, continues Carneades, to resume my Former Discourse where your Curiosity interrupted it; Tis also a common practice in France to bury thin Plates of Copper in the Marc (as the French call it) or Husks of Grapes, whence the Juice has been squeez'd out in the Wine-press, and by this means the more saline parts of those Husks working by little and little upon the Copper, Coagulate Themselves with it into that Blewish Green Substance we in English call Verdigrease. Of which I therefore take Notice, because having Distill'd it in a Naked Fire, I found as I expected, that by the Association of the Saline with the Metalline parts, the former were so alter'd, that the Distill'd Liquor, even without Rectification, seem'd by smell Page 421and Tast, strong almost like Aqua Fortis, and very much surpassed the purest and most Rectifi'd Spirit of Vinager that ever I made. And this Spirit I therefore ascribe to the salt of the Husks alter'd by their Co-Mixture with the copper (though the Fire afterwards Divorce and Transmute them) because I found this later in the bottom of the Retort in the Forme of a Crocus or redish powder: And because Copper is of too sluggish a Nature to be forc'd over in close Vessels by no stronger a heat. And that which is also somewhat Remarkable in the Destillation of good Verdigrease, (or at least of that sort that I us'd) is this, that I Never could observe that it yielded me any oyl, (unless a little black slime which was separated in Rectification may pass for Oyle) though both Tartar and Vinager, (especially the former) will by Destillation yield a Moderate proportion of it. If likewise you pour Spirit of Vinager upon Calcin'd Lead, the Acid Salt of the Liquor will by its Commixture with the Metalline parts, though Insipid, acquire in a few hours a more than Saccharine sweetness; and these Saline Image 222 (page 422)parts being by a strong Fire Destill'd from the Lead wherewith they were imbody'd, will, as I formerly also noted to a Different purpose, leave the Metal behind them alter'd in some qualities from what it was, and will themselves ascend, partly in the Forme of an unctuous Body or Oyle, partly in that of Phlegme; but for the greatest part in the Forme of a subtile Spirit, indow'd, besides divers new Qualities which I am not now willing to take notice of, with a strong smell very much other than that of Vinager, and a piercing tast quite differing both from the Sowerness of the Spirit of Vinager, and the Sweetness of the Sugar of Lead. To be short, As the difference of Bodies may depend meerly upon that of the schemes whereinto their Common matter is put; So the seeds of Things, the Fire and the other Agents are able to alter the minute parts of a Body (either by breaking them into smaller ones of differing shapes, or by Uniting together these Fragments with the unbroken Corpuscles, or such Corpuscles among Themselves) and the same Agents partly by Altering the shape or Page 423bigness of the Constituent Corpuscles of a Body, partly by driving away some of them, partly by blending others with them, and partly by some new manner of connecting them, may give the whole portion of matter a new Texture of its minute parts; and thereby make it deserve a new and Distinct name. So that according as the small parts of matter recede from each other, or work upon each other, or are connected together after this or that determinate manner, a Body of this or that denomination is produced, as some other Body happens thereby to be alter'd or destroy'd. Since then those things which Chymists produce by the help of the Fire are but inanimate Bodies; since such fruits of the Chymists skill differ from one another but in so few qualities that we see plainly that by fire and other Agents we can employ, we can easily enough work as great alterations upon matter, as those that are requisite to change one of these Chymical Productions into another; Since the same portion of matter may without being Compounded with any extraneous Body, or at least Element, be made to put on such a variety Image 223 (page 424)of formes, and consequently to be (successively) turn'd into so many differing Bodies. And since the matter cloath'd with so many differing formes was originally but water, and that in its passage thorow so many transformations, it was never reduc'd into any of those substances which are reputed to be the Principles or Elements of mixt Bodies, except by the violence of the fire, which it self divides not Bodies into perfectly simple or Elementary substances, but into new Compounds; Since, I say, these things are so, I see not why we must needs believe that there are any Primogeneal and simple Bodies, of which as of Pre-exsistent Elements Nature is obliged to compound all others. Nor do I see why we may not conceive that she may produce the Bodies accounted mixt out of one another by Variously altering and contriving their minute parts, without resolving the matter into any such simple or Homogeneous substances as are pretended. Neither, to dispatch, do I see why it should be counted absur'd to think, that when a Body is resolv'd by the Fire into its suppos'd simple Ingredients, those substances are not true and Page 425proper Elements, but rather were, as it were, Accidentally produc'd by the fire, which by Dissipating a Body into minute Parts does, if those parts be shut up in Close Vessels, for the most part necessarily bring them to Associate Themselves after another manner than before, and so bring Them into Bodies of such Different Consistences as the Former Texture of the Body, and Concurrent Circumstances make such disbanded particles apt to Constitute; as experience shews us (and I have both noted it, and prov'd it already) that as there are some Concretes whose parts when dissipated by fire are fitted to be put into such Schemes of matter as we call Oyle, and Salt, and Spirit; So there are others, such as are especially the greatest part of Minerals, whose Corpuscles being of another Size or figure, or perhaps contriv'd another Way, will not in the Fire yield Bodies of the like Consistences, but rather others of differing Textures; Not to mention, that from Gold and some other Bodies, we see not that the Fire separates any Distinct Substances at all; nor That even those Similar Parts of Image 224 (page 426)Bodies which the Chymists Obtain by the Fire, are the Elements whose names they bear, but Compound Bodies, upon which, for their resemblance to them in consistence, or some other obvious Quality, Chymists have been pleas'd to bestow such Appellations.   Page 473 THE CONCLUSION. THese last Words of Carneades being soon after follow'd by a noise which seem'd to come from the place where the rest of the Company was, he took it for a warning, that it was time for him to conclude or break off his Discourse; and told his Friend; By this time I hope you see, Eleutherius, that if Helmonts Experiments be true, it is no absurdity to question whether that Doctrine be one, that doth not assert Any Elements in the sence before explain'd. But because that, as divers of my Arguments suppose the marvellous power of the Alkahest in the Analyzing of Bodies, so the Effects ascrib'd to that power are so unparallell'd and stupendious, Image 225 (page 428)that though I am not sure but that there may be such an Agent, yet little less than  in non-Latin alphabet 	 seems requisite to make a man sure there is. And consequently I leave it to you to judge, how farre those of my Arguments that are built upon Alkahestical Operations are weakned by that Liquors being Matchless; and shall therefore desire you not to think that I propose this Paradox that rejects all Elements, as an Opinion equally probable with the former part of my discourse. For by that, I hope, you are satisfied, that the Arguments wont to be brought by Chymists, to prove That all Bodies consist of either Three Principles, or Five, are far from being so strong as those that I have employ'd to prove, that there is not any certain and Determinate number of such Principles or Elements to be met with Universally in all mixt Bodies. And I suppose I need not tell you, that these Anti-Chymical Paradoxes might have been manag'd more to their Advantage; but that having not confin'd my Curiosity to Chymical Experiments, I who am but a young Man, and younger Chymist, can yet be but slenderly furnished with Page 429them, in reference to so great and difficult a Task as you impos'd upon me; Besides that, to tell you the Truth, I durst not employ some even of the best Experiments I am acquainted with, because I must not yet disclose them; but however, I think I may presume that what I have hitherto Discoursed will induce you to think, that Chymists have been much more happy in finding Experiments than the Causes of them; or in assigning the Principles by which they may best be explain'd. And indeed, when in the writings of Paracelsus I meet with such Phantastick and Un-intelligible Discourses as that Writer often puzzels and tyres his Reader with, father'd upon such excellent Experiments, as though he seldom clearly teaches, I often find he knew; me thinks the Chymists, in their searches after truth, are not unlike the Navigators of Solomons Tarshish Fleet, who brought home from their long and tedious Voyages, not only Gold, and Silver, and Ivory, but Apes and Peacocks too; For so the Writings of several (for I say not, all) of your Hermetick Philosophers present us, together with divers Substantial and Image 226 (page 430)noble Experiments, Theories, which either like Peacocks feathers make a great shew, but are neither solid nor useful; or else like Apes, if they have some appearance of being rational, are blemish'd with some absurdity or other, that when they are Attentively consider'd, makes them appear Ridiculous. Carneades having thus finish'd his Discourse against the received Doctrines of the Elements; Eleutherius judging he should not have time to say much to him before their separation, made some haste to tell him; I confess, Carneades, that you have said more in favour of your Paradoxes then I expected. For though divers of the Experiments you have mention'd are no secrets, and were not unknown to me, yet besides that you have added many of your own unto them, you have laid them together in such a way, and apply'd them to such purposes, and made such Deductions From them, as I have not Hitherto met with. But though I be therefore inclin'd to think, that Philoponus, had he heard you, would scarce have been able in all Page 431points to defend the Chymical Hypothesis against the arguments wherewith you have oppos'd it; yet me thinks that however your Objections seem to evince a great part of what they pretend to, yet they evince it not all; and the numerous tryals of those you call the vulgar Chymists, may be allow'd to prove something too. Wherefore, if it be granted you that you have made it probable, First, that the differing substances into which mixt Bodies are wont to be resolved by the Fire are not of a pure and an Elementary nature, especially for this Reason, that they yet retain so much of the nature of the Concrete that afforded them, as to appear to be yet somewhat compounded, and oftentimes to differ in one Concrete from Principles of the same denomination in another: Next, that as to the number of these differing substances, neither is it precisely three, because in most Vegetable and Animal bodies Earth and Phlegme are also to be found among their Ingredients; nor is there any one determinate number into which the Fire (as it is Image 227 (page 432)wont to be employ'd) does precisely and universally resolve all compound Bodies whatsoever, as well Minerals as others that are reputed perfectly mixt. Lastly, that there are divers Qualities which cannot well be refer'd to any of these Substances, as if they primarily resided in it and belong'd to it; and some other qualities, which though they seem to have their chief and most ordinary residence in some one of these Principles or Elements of mixt Bodies, are not yet so deducible from it, but that also some more general Principles must be taken in to explicate them. If, I say, the Chymists (continues Eleutherius) be so Liberall as to make you these three Concessions, I hope you will, on your part, be so civil and Equitable as to grant them these three other propositions, namely; First, that divers Mineral Bodies, and therefore probably all the rest, may be resolv'd into a Saline, a Sulphureous, and a Mercurial part; And that almost all Vegetable and Animal Concretes may, if not by the Fire alone, yet, by a skilfull Artist Employing the Fire as Page 433his chief Instrument, be divided into five differing Substances, Salt, Spirit, Oyle, Phlegme and Earth; of which the three former by reason of their being so much more Operative than the Two Later, deserve to be Lookt upon as the Three active Principles, and by way of Eminence to be call'd the three principles of mixt bodies. Next, that these Principles, Though they be not perfectly Devoid of all Mixture, yet may without inconvenience be stil'd the Elements of Compounded bodies, and bear the Names of those Substances which they most Resemble, and which are manifestly predominant in them; and that especially for this reason, that none of these Elements is Divisible by the Fire into Four or Five differing substances, like the Concrete whence it was separated. Lastly, That Divers of the Qualities of a mixt Body, and especially the Medical Virtues, do for the most part lodge in some One or Other of its principles, and may Therefore usefully be sought for in That Principle sever'd from the others. And in this also (pursues Eleutherius) Image 228 (page 434)methinks both you and the Chymists may easily agree, that the surest way is to Learn by particular Experiments, what differing parts particular Bodies do consist of, and by what wayes (either Actual or potential fire) they may best and most Conveniently be Separated, as without relying too much upon the Fire alone, for the resolving of Bodies, so without fruitlessly contending to force them into more Elements than Nature made Them up of, or strip the sever'd Principles so naked, as by making Them Exquisitely Elementary to make them almost useless, These things (subjoynes Eleu.) I propose, without despairing to see them granted by you; not only because I know that you so much preferr the Reputation of Candor before that of subtility, that your having once suppos'd a truth would not hinder you from imbracing it when clearly made out to you; but because, upon the present occasion, it will be no disparagement to you to recede from some of your Paradoxes, since the nature and occasion of your past Discourse did not oblige you to declare your own opinions, but only to personate an Antagonist of Page 435the Chymists. So that (concludes he, with a smile) you may now by granting what I propose, add the Reputation of Loving the truth sincerely to that of having been able to oppose it subtilly. Carneades's haste forbidding him to answer this crafty piece of flattery; Till I shal (sayes he) have an opportunity to acquaint you with my own Opinions about the controversies I have been discoursing of, you will not, I hope, expect I should declare my own sence of the Arguments I have employ'd. Wherefore I shall only tell you thus much at present; that though not only an acute Naturalist, but even I my self could take plausible Exceptions at some of them; yet divers of them too are such as will not perhaps be readily answer'd, and will Reduce my Adversaries, at least, to alter and Reform their Hypothesis. I perceive I need not minde you that the Objections I made against the Quaternary of Elements and Ternary of Principles needed not to be oppos'd so much against the Doctrines Themselves (either of which, especially the latter, may be much more probably maintain'd than hitherto it seems to Image 229 (page 436)have been, by those Writers for it I have met with) as against the unaccurateness and the unconcludingness of the Analytical Experiments vulgarly Relyed On to Demonstrate them. And therefore, if either of the two examin'd Opinions, or any other Theory of Elements, shall upon rational and Experimental grounds be clearly made out to me; 'Tis Obliging, but not irrational, in you to Expect, that I shall not be so farr in Love with my Disquieting Doubts, as not to be content to change them for undoubted truths. And (concludes Carneades smiling) it were no great disparagement for a Sceptick to confesse to you, that as unsatisfy'd as the past discourse may have made you think me with the Doctrines of the Peripateticks, and the Chymists, about the Elements and Principles, I can yet so little discover what to acquiesce in, that perchance the Enquiries of others have scarce been more unsatisfactory to me, than my own have been to my self. FINIS.    Page 437 THe Authors constant Absence from the Presse, whilst the former Treatise was Printing, and the Nature of the Subject it self, wherewith ordinary Composers are not wont to be at all acquainted, will, 'tis hop'd, procure the Readers Excuse, till the next Edition, if the Errata be somewhat numerous, and if among them there want not some grosser mistakes, which yet are not the only Blemishes these lines must take notice of and acknowledg; For the Author now perceives that through the fault of those to whom he had committed the former Treatise in loose Sheets, some Papers that belonged to it, have altogether miscarryed. And though it have luckily enough happen'd, for the most part, that the Omission of them does not marr the Cohaerence of the rest; yet till the next design'd Edition afford an opportunity of inserting them, it is thought fit that the Printer give notice of one Omission at the End of the first Dialogue; and that to these Errata there be annex'd the ensuing sheet of Paper, that was casually lost, or forgotten by him that should have put it into the Presse; Image 230 (page 438)where it ought to have been inserted, in the 187. printed Page, at the break, betwixt the words, [Nature] in the 13th. line, and [But] in the next line after. Though it is to be noted here, that by the mistake of the Printer, in some Books, the number of 187 is placed at the top of two somewhat distant pages; and in such copies the following addition ought to be inserted in the latter of the two, as followeth. And on this occasion I cannot but take notice, that whereas the great Argument which the Chymists are wont to employ to vilify Earth and Water, and make them be look'd upon as useless and unworthy to be reckon'd among the Principles of Mixt Bodies, is, that they are not endow'd with Specifick Properties, but only with Elementary qualities; of which they use to speak very sleightingly, as of qualities contemptible and unactive: I see no sufficient Reason for this Practice of the Chymists: For 'tis confess'd that Heat is an Elementary Quality, and yet that an almost innumerable company of confiderable Things are perform'd by Heat, is manifest to Page 439them that duly consider the various Phaenomena wherein it intervenes as a principall Actor; and none ought less to ignore or distrust this Truth then a Chymist. Since almost all the operations and Productions of his Art are performed chiefly by the means of Heat. And as for Cold it self, upon whose account they so despise the Earth and Water, if they please to read in the Voyages of our English and Dutch Navigators in Nova Zembla and other Northern Regions what stupendious Things may be effected by Cold, they would not perhaps think it so despicable. And not to repeat what I lately recited to You out of Paracelsus himself, who by the help of an intense Cold teaches to separate the Quintessence of Wine; I will only now observe to You, that the Conservation of the Texture of many Bodies both animate and inanimate do's so much depend upon the convenient motion both of their own Fluid and Looser Parts, and of the ambient Bodies, whether Air, Water, &c. that not only in humane Bodies we see that the immoderate or unseasonable coldness of the Air (especially when it finds such Bodies everheated) Image 231 (page 440)do's very frequently discompose the Oeconomie of them, and occasion variety of Diseases; but in the solid and durable Body of Iron it self, in which one would not expect that suddain Cold should produce any notable change, it may have so great an operation, that if you take a Wire, or other slender piece of steel, and having brought it in the fire to a white heat, You suffer it afterwards to cool leasurely in the Air, it will when it is cold be much of the same hardnesse it was of before: Whereas if as soon as You remove it from the fire, you plunge it into cold water, it will upon the sudden Refrigeration acquire a very much greater hardness then it had before; Nay, and will become manifestly brittle. And that you may not impute this to any peculiar Quality in the Water, or other Liquor, or Unctuous matter, wherein such heated steel is wont to be quenched that it may be temper'd; I know a very skillful Tradesman, that divers times hardens steel by suddenly cooling it in a Body that is neither a liquor, nor so much as moist. A tryal of that Nature I remember I have seen made. And however by the operation that Water has Page 441upon steel quenched in it, whether upon the Account of its coldness and moisture, or upon that of any other of its qualities, it appears, that water is not alwaies so inefficacious and contemptible a Body, as our Chymists would have it passe for. And what I have said of the Efficacy of Cold and Heat, might perhaps be easily enough carried further by other considerations and experiments; were it not that having been mention'd only upon the Bye, I must not insist on it, but proceed to another Subject.

And yet is not my Translation so bare, Image 5 (unnumbered page)(my good Lord) but that it carryeth in it more plainnesse to the Reader, then perhaps they shall find in the first writer: For beside that I haue culled out their choise things, I haue from the same choise proined, and cut off their superfluitie, I haue supplied their defects, I haue laid open their obscuritie, and I haue shadowed their defaults, neither yet arrogating to my selfe, not derogating from them, but as Dies diem docet, So; Experimentum experiendo confirmatur.

Onely for proofe, it may please thee (good Reader) to admit the Instance in my selfe. VVhen I began first to shake hands with the varietie of delights, that unstayed Youth are commonly carryed away with: and looking backe, (as it were over Image 9 (unnumbered page)my shoulder) saw the vast Sea of sugered miseries that I had waded through, I then beganne to thinke it high time to set downe a surer Compasse to direct the remnant of the course that I haue yet to runne. And although at that time I carried in my purse sufficient wealth to support my calling, in my bodie sufficient health to maintaine my life; and those both so reasonable, as might haue satisfied a reasonable man, (were not Natura hominum novitatis avida) yet found I neither such content in the one, nor the other, as might longer Unnumbered pagecontent mee to continue in that state.

This course yelded so course a liking, as I sooner passed over it, then into it: and casting about againe with my selfe, I was combred with a hundred other odde crochets, all as farre beyond the compasse of my reach, as they were short of the condition of my likeing, till at lengh in the middest Unnumbered pageof this muse, I met in my mind with two such minions, as in my conceit were the only Paragons of the rest: the one gallant and gorgeous garnished with gold and siluer, bedect with jewels, sole Ladie and Governesse of all the rich Mines and Mineralls that are in the bowels of the earth: the other sweet & odoriferous, adorn'd with flowers and hearbs, beautified with delicate spices, sole Lady and Regent of all pleasant things that grow vpon the face of the earth.

Image 2 (unnumbered page) Unnumbered page TO My Honoured and Learned FRIEND, Dr. THOMAS MILLINGION, Fellow of ALL-SO�LS Colledge IN OXON. SIR, THese Papers (some sheets of which, I two years since took the freedom to shew you) had, within some few Weeks after your sight of them, Image 3 (unnumbered page)waited upon you in this dress into which now the Printer has put them, if the Plague had not disappointed my intentions, which, coming to the Town where I liv'd, forc'd me from my House and Studies, having not (I confesse) courage enough, to expose my self and Family to the mercy of so dismall a Disease, against which, flight is the onely infallible preservative. My occasions since have been so many and pressing, that I have had little leisure to collect my scatter'd Papers, and therefore, I must intreat your pardon, as well for the slow performance of my promise, as for whatever else you shall meet with in the Treatise, which may stand in need of it. My design is, to shew, that though the Physiology and Pathology Unnumbered pageof Physick, ought to be modelled according to the new Discoveries in Anatomy, and the Democritical and Chymical Principles, yet that many of the Rules, Methods, and Medicines, which more immediately respect the useful and practical part, are still to be retained, and that they are rather more reconcileable to the Modern, than they were to the Ancient Hypotheses. For, the practical part of Physick being grounded upon Experience, does not so much depend upon the notional, that, this being overthrown, the other must necessarily fall to the ground. The fancies and reasonings of Philosophers and Physitians were built upon the practise, and signifie not much more to the Fundamentals of the Art of Physick, than pinnacles to Image 4 (unnumbered page)the body and foundation of a Building, which (though they be blown down) may stand unshaken. Much of the Therapeutick part of Physick is like Dialls and Almanacks, which agree as well with that of Copernicus, as Ptolemy's Hypothesis. For as the Ancients made a true use of the light and heat of the Sun, in distinguishing and measuring Times and Seasons, and managing of their Husbandry, though probably they err'd in their Notion of his motion round the Earth; so did Physitians no lesse, happily, imploy Apollo's Art in the curing of Diseases, though they were ignorant of the true motion of the Blood, and of (the Sun of the Microcosm) the Heart. It is (I know) objected, To what end have been all these new Discoveries in Physick; and to Unnumbered pagewhat purpose is a farther Inquiry, if the practise be not altered by them? But to this Objection it may be easily answered, that though many of the Rules, Methods, and Medicins of the Ancients be still in force, and must be made use of in the curing of Diseases; yet, when we consider, that in this Art, there must be much left to the judgment and discretion of the Physitian, as to understanding of the Disease, the Complications, and the applying of the Methods, and Remedies seasonably to mens particular Constitutions, it will appear, that an Artist (who proceeds from true principles) is as much to be prefer'd before a bare practitioner, as a good Architect before a common Bricklayer, or Mason, who, though by his practice, he has learnt Image 5 (unnumbered page)to build a Wall, or a stack of Chimneys, will be necessarily at a losse in designing a great and regular Fabrick. It is (I confesse) an absurd temper to be so morose, so addicted to authority and antiquity, as to shut our eyes, lest they should discern a new Truth, and rather disbelieve our own Senses than the Writings of Hippocrates and Galen. But, on the other hand, the humor is no lesse ridiculous, to put on the same levity in matters of Philosophy and Physick, as we do in Clothes, to like nothing which is not of a new fashion, to have a greater esteem for Error and Nonsense in a modish Garb, than Truth and Wisdom in an old-fashioned Dress. Though we see farther than the Ancients did, we must acknowledge, that we stand upon Unnumbered pagetheir Shoulders; and, if we will be ingenuous, that we are the Dwarfs and they the Giants. We need not (I think) in our age, apprehend any danger to Physick from an over-fondness of Antiquity. The growing evil is the other Extream, a fancy of rejecting the wisdome of the Ancients, for the follies and whimsies of some phantastical Pseudo-chymists, which is, like the Americans, to barter Gold and Silver, for Beads and Glass. Sir, Our Nation is of late grown as fond of Enthusiasts in Physick, as they were of those in Divinity; and Ignorance (amongst some men) is become as necessary a qualification for the practise of Physick, as it us'd to be for Preaching. I cannot believe, that the delight which the Vulgar (ray, and some Wise Image 6 (unnumbered page)men) take in being cheated by Mountebanks, proceeds from any principle in Nature, which inclines them to it. But rather think it to be caus'd from Impostours being more industrious in deluding the World, than the true Artists in undeceiving it. There has of late been one of them wondrous busie in possessing the rabble (to whose capacity his Discourse is suited) against the learned Physitians of the Colledge of London, and all others, who have been bred up, and taken degrees in �niversities. He puts them into his own Bears skin, and then baits them. He would make the World believe, that they are a company of narrow streight-lac'd men, who onely confine themselves to Books, and never study Nature, and that they stifle and suppress all Unnumbered pageoccasions of improving their Art. I do not wonder, that they meet with so ill usage at his hands, whose business and profession it has been for above twenty years, to libel almost all sacred and honourable persons of this Nation. I have in this Treatise, endeavored to vindicate them from his false aspersions, by shewing them to have been Authors of the New Improvements and Discoveries in Physick, and the great Promoters of Experimental Philosophy. By the way, I have thought it not improper, to make some reflections upon the Book of this bold and impertinent invader of Physick, and plausible vender of very popular non-sense. The truth is, both Mercurius Politicus, the Author of Medela, and his Book, are so inconsiderable, that they deserve not to be treated Image 7 (unnumbered page)with any respect, especially, since himself so inhumanly tramples upon the ashes of the Ancients, at that wild rate flings dirt upon the learnedst Society of Physitians in the World, and libels the �niversities, not only in his Book, but in his pretensions to have had his Education in them. Yet, my design is not so much to concern my self in the man, or his scurrilous expressions, as to take occasion from those material points in Physick, which he has very idly and extravagantly stated, to treat of them more closely and pertinently, according to the best and truest grounds of Philosophy and Physick. Sir, I have so far presum'd upon your friendship, as not only to trouble you with the reading but countenancing of this Treatise. If it be Unnumbered pagenot suitable to the advantages which I might very well have received from a long acquaintance with you (your converse being as diffusive of Knowledge, as it is of Kindness.) Pray believe that I have minded more the being just to my Promise than careful of my Credit. Sir, I am Westmin. Martii. 10. 1666. Your most obliged friend, and humble Servant, George Castle.

IN Our Translation of the London Dispensatory, we did intend to Compleat that Book, with all such necessary Additions as the Modern way of Practising requires; but finding the Book to swell beyond its designed Limits; whereby, had I done, what I first designed, it would not only have been very Cumbersom, but also past the possibility of being bound up in one Volumn, I was necessitated to cut off much of the matter; and so much the more, for as much, as that it was in great hast of coming forth, and designed to be Sold at an easy price. II. But that the first Design should not totally fall to the ground, I have reduced the Surplussage of what the former could not receive into the following Method; and in the two last Books, the Titles of the Chapters both in the Dispensatory, and in the Supplement Answer one another, the latter containing only what the former wants. Image 3 (unnumbered page) III. This VVork we have divided into three Books; the I. Book is a Supplement to the Materia Medica, containing, as well as particular Additions, a System of the general Notions, relating to the Practical use of the same; wherein among other things, we have compleatly handled the Composition of Medicines, both Medically and Mathematically; as also given you a special abstract of Chymical Preparation, directed to the most useful things in particular. The II. Book contains a Supplement to the Internal Compound Medicaments. The III. Book contains a Supplement to the External Compound Medicaments, all Classically answering to those in the Dispensatory. IV. In this Tract, as you will find the Art of Chymistry Exemplifi'd, together with an Idea of the process of the universal Medicine of Paracelsus; so also you will find many other rare Secrets of the Medical Art, not yet vulgarly known to the VVorld, attained to by much Labour, Pains, Care, and Industry, not only of the Author, but also of several other Worthy and Learned Men, who were persons of great Understanding, men of profound parts, Universal Scholars, practically Experienced, Exemplars �	 Piety, and Professors of these Arts. V. Many very simple Preparations, and mean Compositions you may also here find; which for the poorness of the matter, at first sight may be slighted; but in those low things by us so Unnumbered pagemuch commended, we have found somtimes much more Power and Virtue than in many others of greater Name and Fame, which for their numerous Ingredients, difficulty of Preparation and high priz'd Value, haye made a great noise in the VVorld. VI. However the Book may be worth what you may give for it, if it be but for the Preparation of the seven following things; viz. 1. Our Guttae Vitae, or Cordial Drops. 2. Our Family Pills both with and without Aloes. 3. Our Royal and Bezoartick stone. 4. Our Electuarium ad Tabidos. 5. Our Balsamum Artificiale. 6. Our Regulata, or Ey-Water, than which, without doubt nothing is more excellent of that kind. 7. Our Emplastrum Arthriticum, Or Gout Emplaster. VII. The Compositions and Preporations of all these things, we have very faithfully discovered; except one Ingredient in Our Guttae Vitae, wherein the chief excellency of the whole Composition consists, and without which it has not the quarter part of its Force and Virtues: this thing we thought good to keep in Our own Brest for a season, yet so as we shall not be unwilling to Communicate it to any VVorthy and Ingenious person requesting it of us, of whom we shall be perswaded the republick may be served, and the Author himself not abus'd for such his good will, Image 4 (unnumbered page)nor the Secret, be unseasonably divulged to ingrateful and unworthy Minds. VIII. To Conclude, (Lovers of Art) as I have begun, so I hope I shall continue in this good VVork (through the Assistance of the Divine help) till I have happily rendred the whole Body of Physick, (compleat in all its parts) in the English Tongue; which I know no good Man can be Angery at: and as for evil Men, as it is not my design or desire to please them, so Ivalue them not, their Hateries or Detraction being of equal estimation with Me: Mean season, my Advice to Thee is, That as Thou art a Lover of Art, in the first place, be a Lover of God; who, as he is the only fountain of Wisdom, can only make Thee truly Wise: keep a good Conscience in this untoward Generation; and whatsoever Men may say of Thee, be sure to let Thy Words be few, and Thy Conversation modest; and let Thy Actions bespeak Thee Just and Honest, so will the Blessings of him who dwelt in the Bush, descend upon Thee, and as a Wall of Fire, surround and preserve Thee, (in spite of what Envy or Malice can do) till he Adds to Thy future Happiness, a Crown of Eternal Glory.

Noble SIR, THE Merchant that hath once put to SEA, and made a prosperous Voyage, is hardly with-held from a second Adventure. It hath beene my forwardnesse, not vvithout the Instinct of our Heavenly Pilot, the most Blessed Spirit of God, to make one Adventure before: For he that publisheth Image 3 (unnumbered page) his Meditations, may be well called an Adventurer. God knowes what returne hath beene made to his owne glorie: If but little, (and I can hope no lesse, though I have ever prayed for more) yet that hath beene to mee no little comfort. I am now put forth againe, upon the same Voyage, in hope of better successe.

Image 4 (unnumbered page) Page 1 AN EXPOSITION VPON THE SECOND EPISTLE GENERALL OF THE HOLY APOSTLE, Saint PETER.  CHAP. I.   VER. I. Simon Peter, a Servant, and an Apostle of IESVS CHRIST, to them that have obtained like precious Faith with us, through the righteousnesse of God, and our Saviour IESVS CHRIST.  THE Bookes of the New Testament have been distinguished into three kindes: Historicall, Doctrinall, and Propheticall. 1. Historicall; such as containe the Birth, Life, Death, and Resurrection of our Blessed SAVIOVR, with his Divine Sermons, and Miraculous Actions; written by the foure Evangelists: Seconded by the memorable and famous Storie of the Acts of his Apostles. 2. Doctrinall; such as concerne our instruction in the knowledge of Christ, and teach us the way of salvation. These are the holy Epistles of Saint Paul, S. Iames, S. Peter, S. Iohn, and S Iude. 3. Propheticall; such as foretell the estate and condition of the Church militant to the end of the World: of which kinde is the Revelation of S. Iohn the Divine Yet doth not this distinction debarre the History from altogether medling with Prophecie, nor the Propheticall part from touching upon History, nor the Doctrinall part from the use of both the former. So the Evangelists, that wrote the story of Christ, do neverthelesse abound with heavenly Doctrines, containing in them the life-giving Sermons of that Supreme Bishop of our soules: Neither are they withou plentifull predictions; as of the destruction of Ierusalem, and the end of the world. So the holy Apostles, in their Epistles, Image 5 (page 2) together with their doctrines, by which they build up the Church, do also prophesie of future things: as S. Paul doth of the Calling of the Iewes, and of the comming of Antichrist; and the last Chapter of this present Epistle, hath been aptly called, Saint Peters Prophecie. Concerning which, there have arisen two ancient doubts, like clouds to obscure the light of the Truth. Some have questioned the authority of this Epistle: others, the Author. 1. For those that have contradicted the Authority of it, excluding it out of the number of the Canonicall Bookes,Hist. 3. cap. 25. Eusebius,Lib. 2. Hist. cap 46. Nicephorus,De viris illustr. in Petro. Hierome, andHom. 18. in Ezek. Gregorie, make mention of them. They tell us of some such quarrellers, they tell us not their names: Such there were, but who they were, they do not say. Therefore, let their opinion be buried in the dust with them: for, this Booke lives while they are dead. 2. For the Author, some have denyed it to be S. Peters: and to this error, the supposed diversity of the stile hath induced them. As if the same Author might not diversifie his stile upon due occasion, according to the difference of the matter, or argument upon which, or difference of the person to whom he writes. The Epistle to the Hebrewes is of a more accurate stile, than S. Pauls other Epistles: Yet by an universall consent it is agreed upon to be S. Pauls. Certainly, the Author of this must be some grand Impostour, if hee were not one of those three Apostles,Matth. 17.1. that were present at Christs transfiguration upon the Mount: where hee solemnely professeth himselfe to have beene. The three witnesses of Christs Clarification there, were Peter, and Iames, and Iohn: No man affirmes Iames or Iohn to be the Author of this Epistle, therefore it must be Peter. And if he were not the Author of it, with what impudence should another Secretary call himselfe Simon Peter, a servant and an Apostle of Iesus Christ? To alledge, that Paul,Gal. 2.11. writing to the Galatians, doth plainly testifie, that he withstood Peter to the face, and that hee was to be blamed: therefore it is not likely, that Peter would write so faire an Encomium of Paul,2 Pet. 3.15. & ita admirandum praedicare. Such Critickes are farre from the sanctified spirit of an Apostle: for they, without respect to their private affections, or particular praises, sought only the truth of the Gospell, and the glory of their Master IESVS CHRIST. The Majestie of the HOLY GHOST appeares in every line of it; therefore the Authority is indubitate. The Name prefixed warrants it to be S. Peters, therefore we cannot denie the Author. It remaines only, that we directly come to the matter: In which proceeding, the Spirit of Illumination direct me to write, and the Spirit of Sanctification direct you to read; that all of us, beleeving and living according to the holy Doctrine delivered, the Name of God may be glorified, and our deare soules everlastingly saved, through our Lord Iesus Christ, Amen.  Simon Peter, a servant, and an Apostle of IESVS CHRIST, &c. WHerein we finde a double description: 1. Of the Author, who sends; Simon, &c. 2. Of the Persons to whom this Salutation is sent; To them that have obtained, &c. First, the Authour describes himselfe by his  Name, Simon Peter. Condition, a Servant. Office, an Apostle. Master, IESVS CHRIST.  In nomine humilitas, in conditione sanctitas, in officio dignitas, in domino majestas. His Name shewes him humble, his Condition holy, his Office gratious, by his Master who is glorious. Page 3 Simon was his proper name given him an his Circumcision. It is observable, that this Simon was commonly a happy name in the Scriptures. There was Simon Zelotes, a zealous man: Simon a Tanner, this Simons Host, a charitable man: Simon of Cyrene, that helped Christ to beare his Crosse, a compassionate man: and Simon Peter, a sanctified man. Not that grace is tyed to names; for there was a Simon Magus, a Sorcerer, a Witch, little other than a divell: but the favour of God makes any name as happy. No man hath now the mystery of his fortune written in his name. Names are not Propheticall, Much lesse magicall. The Civill use of names is for distinction; Nomen quasi Notamen: the religious use hath by good antiquitie been observed at our Baptisme. So oft as thou hearest thy owne name, call to minde the Covenant betweene God and thy selfe in holy Baptisme; when God promised on his part to be thy God; thou on thy part to forsake his enemies, and to dedicate thy selfe to his service. It is a wretched forgetfulnesse not to remember thy owne name. What can he remember that forgets himselfe? It is pity the Sacramentall water was ever spilt on such a face; as forgets himselfe to be a Christian. Whatsoever thy name be, let thy heart be Simons. It is said, to signifie Hearing, or Obeying: so do thou confesse, professe, love thy Master and Maker. Confesse him Ore, with thy mouth: professe him Opere, with thy life: love him Corde, with thy heart. So, thou shalt have Simon's omen, though not Simon's nomen. Albeit thou be nor called Peter, thou shalt be saved with Peter. Thus shall Christ blesse thy name with a good report upon earth:Prov. 10.7. The memorie of the just is blessed; with better reward in heaven, byLuc. 10.20 Writing it in the Booke of Life. Peter, was his sir-name, given him by Christ himselfe, who was in this sense his God-father.Ioh. 1.4 2 When IESVS beheld him, h"""" said, Thou art Simon, the sonne of Iona, thou shalt bee called Cephas, which is by interpretation a Stone, or Peter. S. Mathew seemes to insinuate that Christ gave him that name in allusion to that Rocke of his confession.Mat. 16.18. Thou art Peter, and upon this Rocke I will build my Church: But then, Peter seemes to be that Rocke on which the Church is built? Not so; Peter in making this confession, Tu es Christus; Thou art Christ, the Sonne of the living God; either spake, Prae caeteris, as Ambrose, or Pro caeteris, as Augustine; before the rest, or for the rest: He was Prolocutor, or mouth of the rest. Therefore what was promised to Peter, pertained to the whole Colledge of the Apostles. To this exposition runnes the streame of the Fathers.Origen. Hom. 1. in Mat If thou confesse with Peter, & tibi dicetur, Tu es Petrus: Petra, est quisque Christi discipulus: If thou be Christs disciple, thou art Peter, thou art a RockeAug Tract 124. in Ioh. Petrus � Petra, non Petra � Petro: quomodo non � Christiano Christus, sed � Christo Christianus vocatur. Peter is derived from the Rocke, not the Rocke from Peter: as Christ fetcheth not his name from a Christian, but a Christian from Christ. But,Eph. 2.20. we are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Iesus Christ Himselfe being the chiefe Corner-stone; our foundation is in heaven. Aristotle said, that a man is Arbor transversa, a tree growing with the root upward: So the Church is, Domus transversa, a house turned upside downe: for the foundation is above.1 Cor. 3.11. Other foundation can no man lay, than that is layd, which is, IESVS CHRIST. Peter in this kinde is not the Rocke of the Church: time was, he seemed rather to be a wave, than a Rocke, when Christ said to him;Matth. 16.23. Get thee behind me Satan, thou art an offence unto me. Let Peter have his desire, and his Master shall not dye; so Peter himselfe and the whole world had been lost. This defeats the Pope of his infallibility of judgement. Thus Peter is a name of addition, imposed by our Saviour on Simon. Diverse of the Papists have derived the authority of changing the Popes names from hence: Because the two chiefe Apostles had their names changed; Saul into Paul, Simon into Peter. But Lorinus the Iesuite denies this to be the ground of their mutation. Indeed there is a double difference, in Authoritate & Effectis, for Authoritie, the Apostles changed not their owne names, but GOD; for effects, their natures were Image 6 (page 4) changed with their names: a Priviledge that few Popes had the happinesse to demonstrate. Though Sylvius elected Pope, could disclaime his wanton and idle bookes, and seeme to promise future gravitie: Aeneam rejicite, recipite Pium; forget Aeneas, and receive mee a Pious father, yet the new names have not altered the old conditions: they have proved the same men still. The first alterer of Popes names is held to bee Sergius 2. whose proper name was Os perci, a Swines countenance: the name would have served, had he separated his swinish properties. Divers other followed, but they lost not their former vices. One of their owne brings a testimony against them; that of all Christians Italians are the worst, of all Italians the Romans, of all Romans the Priests, of all Priests the Cardinals, and commonly the most lewd Cardinall is chosen Pope, yea, some have objected, and they sticke not to grant; Hominem non Christianum posse esse Romanum Pontificem; a man that is not a member of Christ, may yet be head of his Church. Though change of names import an excellencie of grace, yet not a singularity, Iames and Iohn were Sonnes of thunder: were none so but they? Barnabas, Sonne; of consolation; none so but hee? Peter a Rocke; no rocke but Peter? Israel called so because hee was strong with God; yet so was Abraham, and MOSES, whereas some observe that our Apostle puts in two words into the Epigraph of this Epistle, which he left out in the former; Simon and Servant. And that our SAVIOUR did usually chide him by the name of Simon, but commend him by the name of Peter, whence they observe, it was Simon that erred, not Peter, his Person, not his Office. So Marke 14.37. Simon, sleepest thou? And in his confirmation,Ioh. 21.15. Simon thou Sonne of Ionas, lovest thou me more than these? repeating that word Simon thrice. But they forget that Matth. 16. Get thee behind me Satan; not Simon,Mat. 16 23. but Satan. Indeed Peters name was not changed, but onely he had one added: he was still Simon, but withall Peter. Abraham was not afterward called Abram, but Abraham: But Peter still was called Simon. So here he stiles himselfe; Simon Peter. The Iesuites say, he was alwaies after called Peter, I cannot call them the fathers of lies, that were to doe the Devill wrong; but the sons of lying. I am sure, he is many times after called Simon. But will they now disjoyne these two names in one man? I wonder, when Simon sinned, whether Peter was guiltlesse! If Os porci had been damned, what would have become of Sergius secundus? Thus the poore Shepheard said to the great Bishop of Coleine; admiring his Pompe as a Prince, when his calling was but a Bishop: some replied, that he wore not such robes as he was Bishop, but as he was Prince. I but, quoth the Shepheard; C�m damnatus fuerit Dux, quid fiet de Episcopo? If the Duke should goe to hell for pride, what would become of the humble Bishop? Their names cannot secure their persons, not though they were Pii nominis. And yet as their lives have commonly beene ungodly, so the name of Pietie hath been least usurped among them: for there have been but five Pii. Res mira inter tot Pontifices solummodo quinque fuisse Pios. Here observe three circumstances. 1 The Apostles did prefixe their names to their Epistles. Indeed neither did Moses set his name before his booke, nor the Evangelists, Matthew, Marke, Luke, and Iohn,Chrys. before their Gospels: Because they Praesentibus scribentes, writing to those that were present, had no cause to put to their names. But the Apostles writing to those that were farre off, could not well avoid it in their Epistles, but why then did Paul suppresse his name writing to the Hebrewes? Quia non erant amico in Paulum animo: that Apostle was not in their bookes, they had no good affection toward him: so that finding his name in the frontispiece they might haply have rejected the Epistle, and not vouchsafed to read it. The Apostles could not alwayes instruct men by Sermons, as did the Prophets; nor by commentaries, as the Evangelists, nor by Dialogue, as Iob: but writing to remote persons and places, they were compelled to signifie their mind by letters: and the forme of an Epistle requires a prescription of his name that sent it. They prefixed their names therefore Page 5 that it might be knowne, by what authority such letters were written, and with what certaintie of credit they are to be received.Verse 20. For as no prophecie, so no Epistle of the Scripture is of any private motion, Penna calamus, Scriba Apostolus, Dictator Spiritus Sanctus: The penne a quill, the Writer an Apostle, but the Inditor the Holy Ghost. This bindes us to beleeve and obey these sacred writings. Qui scripta non credit, scripta sentiet: He that will not beleeve what is written, shall feele what is written. Lege historiam, ne fias historia: Read the historie, lest thy selfe be made an history, and an ensample to the reading of after-times. 2 The Apostles did prefixe, not suffixe their names, according to our custome in our familiar letters. Let no man herein taxe them with a proud prelation: for where Gods Spirit is the dictator, wee must looke for no complements. And though in themselves they were the most humble men upon earth, yet being to write Apostolico jure, in the name of IESVS CHRIST, and to signifie themselves such as he had chosen to lay the foundation of the Evangelicall Church; it was fit and necessary, they should premention their names and Office. Paul endured all reproch to his owne person patiently, yet did still magnifie his Office. Ne contemptus Apostoli redundet in Evangelium: lest the contempt of the Apostle should prejudice the Majestie of the Gospell. 3 They prefixed their names, though upon them stucke some bl""mishes; to shew that albeit themselves were guiltie of manifold infirmities"

Image 6 (unnumbered page) Page 1 WHETHER The Vrim & Thummim Were given in the MOUNT, Or perfected by ART. THe clear Vision of an Essence, causeth men to glorifie God, who hath given power unto man, to manifest his eternal purpose of renovation of Image 7 (page 2) the creature by a natural operation: and although the true and natural essences of things are seldom manifestly known by themselves, yet humane learning, being as a sickle, whereby we reap divine knowledge, directs us to the mark; and the Philosophers all agree, Essences are bright, pure, and clear, confused in the creature, and may be purified, but the manner is not easily agreed, so that they lead us to the consideration of several Arts, and of natural and Artificial things, jointly and severally� some Arts have their termination in silence, as Rhetorick and Pleadings� others have their perfection upon the Superficies, as painting and carving: But the true Alchymist excludes all vulgar operations to extract the internal beauty; and there are three kinds of labourers in this Art, Alchymistae, Lauchymistae, Lachrymistae; yet no Art may justly be condemned for the fault of the Professors. For Albertus Magnus saith, Hoe artificium Page 3 omni arte certius ac sublimius est, & certissimum habet effectum. They name their Matter Adam, because from red earth he became the salt and light of the world, so onely man, and their corporate lights, are called Microcosmus: therefore they consider wisdome in a created nature, as well subject to sense as invisible, and consequently material, because quality is as the matter of the Elements, and the central vertue is real, and may be specificate; neither is it contrary to nature, but beyond nature, that the true sense, and lively practice make one perfection. The Philosophers say, Whosoever hath their mystery, knows the thing in being, and in being and use before practice, and each for himself affirms: I write nothing, save that I have seen and done, nor have I done any thing, save that I knew before. Although that which is hid, is more than can be spoken, yet their whole intent is to manifest that which is hid, and to hide that which is manifest, Image 8 (page 4) therefore they conclude: Felix scientia cum sciente, and the holy Text saith, God giveth wisdome to the wise,Dan. 2.12. and knowledge to them that know understanding. But because the question stands betwixt divine tradition, and natural disposition, we must look to the beginning, when the eternal Word commanded,Gen. 1. and it was made: but in the Generation of Heaven and Earth, there is inserted a power of the perpetuation of Creation, wherein Vrim & hummim are created remotissima.Gen. 2. Psal: 33:9: Heb. 11.3. For albeit the visible onely are mentioned, yet the invisible are understood, and difference taken betwixt things instituted without means, and those produced by help of mean subjects. For Almighty God is not said to rest, as if he had travelled in his work,Esay. 48.3.40.28. but because he created no more any new kind of Creatures, than by the power of the word Fiat; Therefore not the Vrim & Thummim, save as they subsisted in other things like Misseltoe, which Page 5 hath body, branch, and berry, yet no root of it self. But if we remember the things of old, we may declare these last from the first:Is. 96.9, 10. For from the end of every intention springs the beginning, and the wisdom of God hath ordained diversity, but his power maketh all things equall, and thereby is manifested the eternal beauty. The Vrim & Thummim were substances; for Moses put them into the breast-plate, the words signifie light and perfection, knowledge and holiness,Lev. 8.8. manifestation and truth, so the sense and substance doth predicate each other, as the convertible terms of Science and Essence make one perfection, and the substances were bright and perfect: also joint and several, because none can come to perfection without knowledge, and where the Almighty God appointed the end, he gives the means to deliver the Creature from the bondage of the Elements. Wisdome, Understanding and Knowledge, Image 9 (page 6) are the means to attain them, and the gifts of grace are signified by them also. The Philosophers call the manifestation of the centrall vertue, Donum Dei, In their sacred use they were objective to the golden Cherubims, whose wings were stretched to the outmost side of the Temple, they signified the plenitude of Science, which hath identity with Essence; there was also the scarlet vail, which seemed ever moving,Eze. 28.5:14, 16: and signified pure fire generative, and moving, which selected and fixed in clear bodies, is �rim & Thummim� For when the four spirits of the heavens proceed from the Lord of all the Earth, and were fixed in the North, then take silver and gold, and make crowns. There is a spiritual and natural use of these things,Luc. 6:5, 8, 11 the Creator by his absolute power, may make children of stones, but his ordinary power requires means; and because the insensible things should make his love to man more apparent; he commandeth Page 7 the Ark of Noah, and the Ark of the Testimony, to be made after the proportion of mans body,Gen. 6:14: the length six times the breadth, and ten times the thickness; in which numbers are contained all perfections. Yet is objected, they were not commanded to be made,Exo: 28:30 but to be put into the breast-plate. The great and glorious works of God are not unknown unto himself, but unto us, they are by present command, or by successive course, as the first fruits were supernatural; and again, the trees brought forth the same year, according to their natural course and perfection: also the word Essence, containeth the natural & spiritual condition of bodies, which are so fast connexed, that the true and natural Essence, is with great difficulty made apparent, although the matter be but as a light case to the form: In generation it moves a non ente ad ens. in corruption it moves ab ente actu ad non ens. Also some things have existence by the Image 10 (page 8) subject, which have no Essence in nature, neither are said to be created, as darknels, and silence, and things of putrefactive kind. So in the putrefaction of the Creature, that is not properly said to be made, which by an inward power doth purge it self by ebullition, and a kind of new generation, as doth the pure sulphur of Metal, the Artist being but as a Mid-wife; so that there is a necessary difference betwixt that which hath being by the power of Gods work, and the work of man; for no effect is said to be necessary from the first and remote causes, but from the second and neerer; as in the spiritual operation in man,Esa: 32:17: the work of Righteonsness is peace, and the effect, quietness and assurance for ever. Also taking away Evening and Morning, which is mixed knowledge, the light of the seven dayes shall be a perpetual blessing, and perfect knowledge. Now to descend again to the Philosophers, Morien Romanus saith, secretum Page 9 secretorum est illa dispositio, quaem anibus perfici non potest. Haec enim dispositio est naturarum mutatio. Another saith, Ars ergo postcontemplationem omnium horarum sequitur naturam, & recipit spiritus natura immundos, & eos sublimando subluerat & mundat, & tunc volendo fugere ab igne, ars ministrat naturas & natura eos convertit in corpora munda fixa, & de caeteris natura corporum dominabitur naturae spirituum in aeternum, per hoc ingenium mirabile. Bezaleel had the spirit of wisdom,Exo: 31:3, 4: understanding and knowledge, which are the means to attain this effect, and his ends directed to devise works in gold, silver and brass, which although in sound of words they seem inferiour, yet they are in exaltations in Art progressive to the producing of Vrim & Thummim. For all the glorious furniture of the Tabernacle was not for worldly pomp, but for spiritual mysterie and beauty of the Doctrine of the Law and the Gospel: so in natural things, there is no greater Image 11 (page 10) mysterie than that the incorrupted quality of pure sulphur, should have regal power and rest, eternally visible, shining as the Sun in glory. As a man is chiefest of the Creatures, so gold is purest of bodies, Lord of stones, and noblest of Metals, which one cals secretum magnum Dei, and another saith, ille spiritus in Auro idem est cum spiritu generate omnium creaturarum: est que eadem unica generativa natura per omnia diffusa. And as the Sun is chiefest amongst celestial bodies, so his spirit doth raign over the fourfold nature, and being corporate is without shadow. One of the Rabbins saith, in the second Temple they made �rim & Thummim, therefore that which hath been done, may be done, although the materials be concealed. For good in a better, is ever more excellent; but if Phidias gave him rude and obstinate stuff to carve,Esai 45:2, 3 let his art do what it can, his work will want the beauty. And because nature of her self cannot attain her Page 11 highest perfection, the Artist must break the gates of brass, and cut in pieces the barres of iron, that is ignorance, and the matter of the Elements, whereby the treasures of darkness, and incorporeal substances are hidden from us, but being removed,2 Kin: 6:17 the invisible Essence is apparent, as the chariots of fire about Elisha. These Rabbins also hold every natural beginning to be either matter, or the cause of matter, viz. The four Elements sub nutus Dei, which they express in Numbers and figures, for number is Unity folded up, and Unity is number unfolded. The Mathematical number is collected of many Unites, as a line of many points; And number is said to be formed, and material signifying Principia & Elementa, because vocabulum naturale est symbolum numeri, which is expressed in the setting of the precious stones four rowes, three in a row,Exo: 28:17 four to shew the natural perfection, and three the inward genreration; as three and four the Image 12 (page 12) artificial exaltation. For these natural bodies do not shew forth their vertues,Rev. 21:18 until they be made spiritual; the precious stones signified the excellency of gifts in the Teachers, and the Vrim & Thummim the gifts of grace in the heart, because the central vertues are their materials, quia virtutes formant ad speciem. In things of greatest concordance are greatest vertues; for that which is most abundant in vertue, doth most excel in glory and beauty: Bezaliel hath the spirit of knowledge to devise works in gold, therefore his invention must necessarily consider the possibility from the object, and how to work upon the form, as well as upon the matter, and upon the center as upon the superficies: For seeing the perfection of the matter is glorious, the perfection of the form must necessarily be more glorious; because the bodily nature shall eternally predominate: In the Creation the substance of the Sun was light corporate Page 13 the fourth day, light is never without heat, and radical heat is the occultum corporis, which augmented and fixed, shines as the Sun in glory, which shews the majesty of nature as in a liquid glass; notwithstanding,Cor. 5:37 that which is sowed is not quickned, except it die, and it is a rule amongst the Philosophers: Ad perfectionem omnium Artium requiritur renascentia. To like purpose another saith: Corpus ad omnes perferandas miserias est ordinatum. Oportet enim transire per ignem & aquam & renasci, aliter in requiem eternam ingredi non poterit. And another saith, Post resurrectionem habemus gloriam & fortitudinem sempiteranam tunc gaudebunt omnes in prosperitate magn� qui sciunt nostrum progressum. So the end of every intention shews the beginning, the Creatures were made perfect, and to be perfect: for the formal and final cause is the same, the difference is in the perfections. Some hold that the ancient Philosophers by this holy art have become Image 13 (page 14) Prophets: And because Adam his dominion of the creatures was the knowledge of their natures and Properties, by this Science he knew the world should be twice destroyed: For both fire and water are necessarily required to the purification of the creature. And as sense is the light of nature, so reason is the perfection of sence, & by example we see with others eys, but by reason with our own. Notwithstanding we may consider Tubal-Cain,Gen: 4""32 who was an instructer of every Artificer in brass and iron"

LONDON, Printed, and are to be sold by Moses Pitt at the White Hart in Little Britain, 1670.    Image 3 (unnumbered page) Page 3 BASILIUS VALENTINUS, OF Natural and Supernatural Things.  CHAP. I. BEcause I have at this present undertaken to write of the of the first Tincture, the Root of Metals and Minerals, and to inform you of the Spiritual Essence, how the Metals and Minerals are at first spiritually Image 4 (page 4) conceived and born corporally; it will be necessary first of all to utter, and to acquaint you by a speech, that all things consist of two parts, that is, Natural and Supernatural; what is visible, tangible, and hath form or shape, that is natural; but what is intactible, without form, and spiritual, that is supernatural, and must be apprehended and conceived by Faith; such is the Creation, and especially the Eternity of God without end, immensible and incomprehensible; for Nature cannot conceive nor apprehend it by its humane reason: This is supernatural, what Reason cannot apprehend, but must be conceived by Faith, this is a Divine matter, and belongs to Theology, which judgeth Souls. Moreover, there appertains to supernatural things, Page 5 the Angels of the Lord, having clarified Bodies, doing that by the permission of their Creator, which is impossible for any other Creature to do, their Works being concealed from the Eyes of the World, and so likewise are the Works of the Infernal Spirits and Devils unknown, which they do by the permission of the most High God. But above all the great Works of God are found and acknowledged to be supernatural, not to be scann'd and comprehended by Humane Imaginations; such is in especial the great Grace and Mercy of God which he bestows upon Mankind out of his great Love, which indeed no man can apprehend or know, and other great and wonderful works which he hath manifested divers manner of wayes by Christ our Saviour and Image 5 (page 6) Redeemer, for the confirmation of his Omnipotence and Glory: As when he raised Lazarus from the dead, Iairus his Daughter, the Ruler of the Synagogue, and the Widows Son of Naim. He made the Dumb to speak, the Deaf to hear, and the Blind to see, all which are supernatural, and Magnalia Dei; so also was his Conception, Resurrection, Descension, and Ascension into Heaven, too deep and mysterious for Nature; all which is only to be obtained by Faith. There belongs likewise to supernatural things, the taking of Enoch and �	 into Heaven, the divine rapture of St. Paul in the Spirit into the third Heaven. Moreover, many supernatural things are done by Imagination, Dreams, and Visions; many wonders are done by the Imagination Page 7 witness the speckled Sheep by the speckled Rods laid in their watring places. God warned the wise men of the East by an especial Dream not to return again to Herod; likewise their three Persons, their three Gifts, Presents, or Offerings, and the supernatural Star, have all their peculiar and mystical meaning. Nor was that Dream which hapned to Pilates Wife natural, who unjustly adjudged our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ to death. The Vision of the Angels which appeared to the Shepherds at the Birth of Christ, and to the Women at his Sepulchre, who sought his Body where they had laid it, cannot be accounted Natural. There are many other supernatural things done at several times by the Prophets & Saints; so was the voice of the Ass speaking Image 6 (page 8) to Balaam, contrary to the common course of Nature; as also Joseph's Interpretation of Dreams. And so God by his Angels preserves us oftentimes from infinite Evils, and delivers us out of manifold Dangers, impossible for Nature to do. All this & many others belong to Theology, and to Heaven, whereunto the Soul is to have regard. Now follows the supernatural things of the visible Works of God, as we see them in the Firmament; to wit, the Planets, Stars, and Elements, which are above our Reason, only their Course and Motion is observed by speculation and reckoning, which belongs to Astronomy; it is a visible but incomprehensible Being, performing its operation in a Magnetick way, out of which likewise divers Page 9 admirable things are found and observed, which ar� altogether supernatural; understand it thus, that the Heaven operates in the Earth, and the Earth affords a correspondence with the Heavenly. For the Earth hath also its seven Planets, which are operated and bred by the seven Celestial, only by a spiritual Impression or Infusion, even as the Stars operate all Minerals. This is done incomprehensibly and spiritually, and therefore it is to be accounted supernatural, even as two Lovers, their persons are visible, but their Love one to the other is invisible: Humane Bodies are tangible and natural, but Love is invisible, spiritual, intangible and supernatural, comparable to a Magnetick Attraction only; for the invisible Love which is attracted unto it spiritually Image 7 (page 10) by the Imagination is, accomplish'd by the desires and fruition. In like manner when the Heaven hath a love to the Earth, and the Earth hath a Love, Inclination, and Affection towards Man, as the great World to the lesser; for the lesser World is taken out of the greater, and when the Earth by the desires of its invisible Imagination doth attract unto it self such a Love of the Heaven, there is thereby an Union of the Superiour and Inferiour, as Man and Wife are accounted one Body together, and after this Union the Earth is impregnated by the Infusion of the Heaven, and begins to conceive and bring forth a Birth sutable to the Infusion, and this Birth after its Conception is digested by the Elements, and brought to a perfect Ripeness, and this is reckoned Page 11 among the supernatural things; how the supernatural Effence performs its operation in the natural. Among the supernatural things are like wise reckoned all Magical and Cabalistical Matters which depend thereon, arising out of the Light of true knowledge, not those which proceed from Superstition, Conjuration, or unlawful Exorcisme, such as the Sorcerers use; but I mean in this place such a Magick as the Wise men had that came out of the East, who by Revelation from God, and by true allowable Art judged rightly; or such an one, as those of old had before us, usual among the Egyptians and Arabian, before Writing was found, they noted, observed, and reserved by Signs, Characters and Hieroglyphicks. Such Blessings may Image 8 (page 12) be used, which Christ the Son of God used, as the Scripture saith; He took little Children, laid his hands upon them, and blessed them. But whatsoever is contrary to God and his Word, ought justly to be rejected, and not to be tollerated, because they are not Godly, but Diabolical. But those Supernatural things which oppose not God and his Holy Word, belong unto Magick, and do the Soul no prejudice. As concerning Visions which Holy Men of God have often seen, it is reason they should be reckoned among those things which are not Natural; for whatsoever man speculates and comprehends by the Mind, is Supernatural; on the contrary, whatsoever he can take, see, and hold is Natural. Page 13 Let us consider the third part of Natural & Supernatural things in Physick, the Virtues and Powers of each; this Medicine of every thing must first be driven out of a visible, tangible, natural Body, and be brought into a spiritual, meliorated, supernatural operation, that the Spirit which at the first was infused and given to the Body to live, might be released, that it should operate and penetrate as a Spiritual Essence, and Fire, having its Vent-holes left that it might burn and have no opposition, which might suffocate, suppress, or hinder the burning Life; whereas otherwise, if the separation of the Soul and Spirit from the Body should not first be done, there could not succeed any operation either effectual, profitable, or necessary; for whatsoever is visible, to be Image 9 (page 14) felt, and inseparably in a Body, that is Natural and Corporal; but so soon as there is a separation, the living departs from the dead, gaining its perfect operation, and the natural Body being separated, the spiritual Essence is free to penetrate, becoming a spiritual and supernatural Medicine. In brief, all things (none excepted) which we can touch and handle, are natural, but they must be made supernatural, if you would prepare them for Physick; for the supernatural only hath a living power in it to operate, the natural hath only a dead tangible Form. For when Adam was made, he was dead, having no life of any virtue, but so soon as the operative quickning Spirit came to him, then he manifested his living virtue and power by supernatural admiration, so that in Page 15 every thing there is the natural and supernatural united in one, and bound together in their habitation, that every thing might be perfect; for all created things in the world are some supernatural, only what concerns the Soul and spiritual matters, and some are natural and supernatural, with what concerns the Elements and Firmament, as likewise the Minerals, Vegetables, and Animals, which is known and found, when they are separated one from the other, that the Soul departs out of the Body, and the Spirit forsakes its Soul, leaving the Body an empty habitation. Moreover, you must understand and consider, that the great and little World are made and formed of one first Matter, by an unsearchable Almighty Essence, at that time in the beginning, Image 10 (page 16) when the Spirit of God moved upon the Water, who was from Eternity without beginning. The great World, as Heaven and Earth, was first, then was Man, the Little World, taken out of the greater; the Water was separated from the Earth, the Water was the Matter whereon the everlasting Spirit of God moved; the Little World was formed of the noblest Earth, as its Quintessence, by the Aquosity which yet was in the Earth, and all was only Natural; but after the breathing in of the Divine heating Breath, immediately the Supernatural was added; so then the Natural and Supernatural were knit and united. The great World is perishable, yet there will be a New Earth or World; the Little World is Eternal, the Great, Created, Dissoluble Page 17 world will again be brought to nothing, but the little world will be clarified by the Spirit of God, because he possesses it, making a Celestial clarified water out of the aforesaid Earthly water; then it will follow, that the first matter will be turned into the last, and the last matter will become the first. Now the reason why the great world is perishable, is this, that the Spirit of God hath not his dwelling or habitation in the great world, but in the little world; for Man is the Temple of the Holy Ghost, if he do not wilfully defile himself, adhering to the Hellish Fire, which makes a breach and difference. For he remaines in the little world, which he formed after his own similitude, and made him a consecrated Temple; otherwise there is every thing in the Image 11 (page 18) little world which is to be found in the great, as Heaven and Earth, with the Elements, and what depends thereon, or appertains thereunto. We find also that in the first Creation, which was performed of nothing, three things arose; to wit, a Soulish, Spiritual, Invisible Essence, which represented a Mercurial Water, a Sulphurous Vapour, and a Terrene Salt; these three gave a compleat and perfect, a tangible and formal Body to all things wherein especially all the four Elements are contained, as I have already mentioned in my Writing where I treat of the Microcosme. But that I may yet give a little more information of Natural and Supernatural things, as well spiritual as corporal: We find that the Canaanitish Woman was Page 19 cured of her Flux of Blood which held her twelve years, only by a bare touch, when she touched the Garment of the Son of God, her Disease being natural, but the Medicine or Cure was Supernatural, because by her Faith she gained help from the Lord Christ. Likewise we have an excellent, high and supernatural Miracle in the three Children, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who were cast into the fiery Furnace, by the Command of King Nebuchadnezzar, yet by God wonderfully delivered, and not consumed, Dan. 3. So also the Confusion of Tongues, and Infusion of divers Speeches at the foolish structure of the Tower of Babel, which should have reached up to Heaven, is esteemed for a Supernatural Image 12 (page 20) Miracle. And so was that a Supernatural Sign, when the Children of Israel did lap water as Dogs do, when a small Number at Gods Command, fought against the Midianites, Judg. 7. 6. So the sending of the Dove by Noah out of the Ark, when she brought an Olive Branch in her Bill, a Sign of Mercy, and a Divine Supernatural Message. When the Holy man of God Moses struck the Rock with his Rod, that the hard Rock yielded Water, is beyond humane Reason; so was the turning of the salt water into sweet and drinkable, supernatural. As also the dry passage of the Children of Israel through the Red Sea; and the Budding of Aarons Rod, are all supernatural. In brief, the Resurrection of Christ the Eternal Son of God out of the grave, Page 21 for all the Tomb-stone, his appearing to the two men going to Emas, his revealing himself to his Disciples when the Door was lock'd, are all Divine and Supernatural. Divers Examples more might be recited out of Divine Writ, which for Brevities sake I omit. Among Supernatural things are accounted all Mineral Signs, as the Appearance of Spirits, Representations, Pigmies appearing diversly and numerously, giving notice of good or bad Luck, Ruine or Riches; so also those Figures, Shapes, or other works found in the Ores of Metals, as of Men, Fishes, and other Creatures, so formed and represented by the imagination of the three first Principles, then ripened and fully digested by the Earth, and other Elements. Hereunto appertain Image 13 (page 22) the Monsters of the Earth, and such things as are found within the Earth at certain times of a wonderful form and shape, but not at all to be found when that time is past, yet appear again and are to be found at some other time. Hereunto also belong all Visions and Appearances performed by Water, Glasses, Cristal, or other means, as also those done by Sigils and Characters, which yet are so various, some being only Natural, yet affording Supernatural appearances or sights; but the others which are performed by Conjurations, are neither Natural nor Supernatural, but Diabolical, belonging unto Sorcery, and are prohibited all good Christians; so likewise all those Means which oppose Holy Writ, Gods Word and Commandments, Page 23 are to be rejected and refuted by true Natural Cabalists; I say this, because a certain distinction and sure order ought to be found of the Natural, Supernatural, Unnatural things. In like manner there appertains unto Supernatural things, all the Water-Spirits, as the Syrens, Succubi, & other Water-Nymphs, with their Relations, as likewise the Terrestrial Spirits, and those which inhabit the Air, who sometimes are heard, seen, or perceived, sometimes foretelling Death or other Disasters, sometimes they discover by their Apparition Riches and good Fortune in certain places, and the Fiery Spirits appertain here also, which appear in a fiery shape, or like a burning Light; all these are Spirits having untangible Bodies, Image 14 (page 24) yet are they not such Spirits as the right Hellish Spirits, who hunt after mens Souls as an Eternal Jewel, even as the Infernal Lucifer, the Devil and his Dependents do, who were ejected with him; but these are such Spirits which are above Nature, set before Men for admiration, and are only maintained by the Elements, whereby they are nourished and fed; but when this Earthly world shall cease, they also shall decay and vanish with it, because they have no Souls to be saved. I will say no more hereof at present, but refer the opening of such Circumstances more at large to another opportunity, where I shall particularly treat of Visions and spiritual Appearances, which are esteemed Unnatural by most part of the World, yet truly are Natural, Page 25 but they are found to be Supernatural in their Operations and wonderful Qualities. That I may further confirm my Assertion, I say likewise, that there are many things to be found in Physick, which yield and manifest their workings supernaturally in a Magnetical way, operating only by an attractive spiritual power which is attracted to it by the Air; for the Air is the Medium between the Physick and the Hurt or Distemper, even as the Magnet ever doth direct and turn it self towards its Polestar, though the star be many thousand Miles distant from it, yet the spiritual operation and sympathy between them is so prevalent, that it is attracted together at so vast a distance by the Medium or middle Band of the Air; but because this attractive Image 15 (page 26) power is only known unto people in general, or as a thing common, it is therefore become customary, and is so esteemed, there being no notice taken of any further Secret whence this operative Faculty hath its Source or Original: In like manner Hurts and Distempers may be healed and cured, though the Patient and Physitian be very far distant one from the other; not by Charmes, Exorcismes, or other unlawful prohibited means, which are opposite to God and Nature, but by such means wherein the attractive Magnetick Virtue lies to accomplish it. As when a wounded person goes a Journey, leaving the Weapon wherewith he was wounded, or else of his Bloud which issued out of the wound with his Physician, wherewith he proceeds rightly and by Page 27 orderly means, as is usual in dressing a wound, without all doubt he shall be absolutely cured, this is no Witchcraft, but the cure is performed only by the attractive power of the Medicine, which is carried to the Sore by the means of the Air, wherewith it is mundified, that it may perform the Spiritual Operation. Some will think these hard sayings, and impossible in Nature, and many will say it is contrary to Nature, whereby many will be excited to dispute it, and raise Arguments one opposite to the other, whether it be Natural or no, whether it be possible or no, or whether it be Sorcery: I will thus resolve them, that this Cure is natural, but as it operates it is supernatural & spiritual, because it is performed meerly by Image 16 (page 28) an attractive incomprehensible means, and that this manner of Cure is no Sorcery: I affirm it hereby, that it is not mixt or accompanied with any Sorcery, nor with any other unnatural Means, contrary to God the Creator, or his holy and saving Word. But it is only Natural, out of its supernatural, invisible, incomprehensible, spiritual, and attractive power, which received its Original from the Sydereal, and performs its Operation by the Elements. Lastly, I likewise approve this Cure to be no Sorcery, because the Devil rather delights in all Mischief to Mankind, than to assist any manner of way for their benefit, which yet is impossible for him to do without Gods permission. Much more might be written of this Magnetick Page 29 Form, but I chuse rather to be silent; referring it till I come to treat of the Natural Miracles of the World. The grosser sort of foolish Wits, who imagine themselves to be wise Philosophers, and all others who are not in their perfect senses, know no difference in this case, but the wise and truly discreet well know how to distinguish betwixt that which is natural and that which is supernatural. For do but observe this comparison, to be proved by a gross Example, how many Creatures are there which dye absolutely in the water, so that no life is left therein, but so soon as the pleasant Summer appears, the natural heat gives a new life, & the Body quite restored in the same substance as it was before in Image 17 (page 30) its living Motion; even as an Herb, which dies in the Winter, but in the Spring it manifests it self anew. The death of these things is to be esteemed natural, but the return of a new life in its knowledge is supernatural; but because we are accustomed to all these things, the least part of us consider what is worthy of further Meditation in this case, letting both natural and supernatural go away together. Most people overpass, that natural custom which yet is supernatural, as also monstrous Births, and those that bring signs and marks with them into the world; which may all be natural, but manifest themselves supernaturally, by the imagination which caused them: These supernatural forms and customs, the Mother of the Child caused by intervening Page 31 thoughts, which unexpectedly happened to her, as it were by accident: Even as we often see and find, that many Men naturally are born with some gestures, which he can never leave, though he endevour with all his might to do it. The natural gestures of these Men are natural, but the conception in the Womb which caused the imagination of these things is supernatural, and subject to what the Heaven imprints. To conclude: I say, that none can defend the supernatural not to be true by good grounds and reasons, except he have learn'd to know the natural, which hath its original, and gained its shape from the supernatural; after he hath learned this, he may evidence it by sure proofs, that he will be conquerour over those, Image 18 (page 32) who will not believe what is supernatural; and he will convince the opinions of those who dispute of natural things, and yet know not the grounds, saving only a bare pretence, much talk, tedious and unprofitable Debates.   Page 33 CHAP. II. Of the first Tincture and Roots of Metals. BUt now to come to my intent, and by Gods permission to accomplish the same. I undertake to certifie of the first Tincture, Root, and Generation of Metals and Minerals: Know that the first Tincture and Root of all Metals, is likewise a supernatural, flying, fiery Spirit; which preserves it self in the Air, seeking its habitation naturally in the Earth and Water, wherein it can rest and operate: This Spirit is found in all Metals, more abundant in other Metals than in Gold, because Image 19 (page 34) Gold, by reason of its well digested, ripened, and fixt body, is tight, close, and compact, and therefore no more can enter into its body than is just requisite; but the other Metals have not such fixt bodies, for their pores are open, and far extenuated, therefore the Tincture Spirit can the more abundantly pass thorough and possess them. But because the bodies of the other Metals are inconstant, the Tincture cannot remain with those inconstant bodies, but must depart. And whereas the Tincture of Gold is found in none more plentiful than in Mars and Venus, as Man and Wife, their bodies therefore are destroyed, and the tinging Spirit taken out of them, which makes Gold sanguin, being first opened and prepared, and by their food and Page 35 drink it becomes volatile, wherefore this volatile Gold being satisfied with its food and drink, assumes its own bloud to it self, dries it up by its own internal heat, by the help and assistance of the vaporous fire, and there is a Conquest again, which is quite fix'd, makes the highest Constancy, that the Gold becomes an over-fix'd Medicine, by reason of abundance of Bloud it yields no Body, except another superfluous Body be again put to it, wherein the abounding fix'd bloud may disperse it self; this additional Metallick Body, by reason of the great heat of the fix'd Lions bloud, is penetrated as by fire, and purged from all impurity, and forthwith throughly digested to a perfect ripeness and fixedness: That first of all the Servant brings the Master unto Image 20 (page 36) Riches, because the Master before could not spare any of his Cloaths to give away, seeing that Nature had lent and endowed him with one Noble Suit only; on the other side, the King, when he hath received his Aides and Contributions from his Subjects, can then distribute possessions, and permanent Liveries, that the Lord and Servant may remain both together; and do not think it strange, that the King needs to borrow of his Subjects, because their Bodies are unfix'd and inconstant, for they receive much, and yet can keep but little Credit: But if the King can participate thereof, he will the better overcome heat and Frost, than the Leprous Metals can; and henceforth by this Receipt he becomes particularly a Dominator and Conquerour of all other, Page 37 with a great Victory and triumph of Riches and of Health to long Life. I hope you have from the beginning sufficiently understood concerning this Natural and Supernatural Advice, and the first tinging Root of Metals and Minerals, whereon the Corner-stone is placed, and where the true Rock is grounded in its kind, wherein Nature hath placed and buried her secret & deeply concealed Gifts; to wit, in the fiery tinged Spirits, which Colours they gained out of the starry Heaven by the operation of the Elements; and they can moreover tinge and fix that which before was not tinged and unfix'd, seeing that Luna wants the Robe of the Golden Crown, together with the fixedness, as likewise Saturn, Jupiter, and Mercury do; and although Mars and Venu's Image 21 (page 38) need not this Rayment, but can communicate it to the other five, yet I say, that they can perform nothing to attain any thing with wealth without the Lion, because they are not sufficiently accomodated with a fixedness of their Mercury, and a gentleness of their Salt, except it be that the Lion overcome them, that they have triumphed on both parts, and gained a remarkable Melioration altogether; this Melioration lies concealed in their Signate star, or Magnet, out of which all Metals have themselves received their Gifts. Now I will proceed, and particularly step to the Birth and Generation, how the Archaeus manifests its power; pouring it forth, and daily reveales it, whereby all Metallick and Mineral Forms are visibly proposed, Page 39 and made formal, tangible, and corporal by the Mineral, intangible, flying, fiery Spirits: Understand therefore further, and observe with diligence and care, that by forgetfulness you let not that which is weighty pass away, nor yet neglect or overlook that which is most profitable, and on the contrary observe the bare words at length, passing over the Truth; for what I write herein, is undoubtedly held and esteemed that the highest is undoubtedly by many esteemed for the lowest, and the lowest for the highest Mystery, and is so to be reputed. Now you must first know, that all Metals and Minerals of the Earth have one only Matter and Mother, whereby in general they all received Conception, gaining a compleat and corporal Birth. Image 22 (page 40) This Matter which comes out of the Center, first of all divides it self into three parts, to procure one corporal or certain form of each Metal. These three parts are only fed in the Earth by the Elements, out of their Bodies, and nourish'd till they be perfect. But the Matter which comes out of the Center is imagined by the Stars, operated by the Elements, and formed by the Earth: It is a Matter to be known, and the true Mother of Metals and Minerals: It is such a Matter and Mother, whereof Man himself is conceived, born, nourish'd, and made corporal: It may be compared to the middle World, for what is in the great World is in the little World, and what is in the little World is also in the greater; and what is jointly in the great and Page 41 little World is likewise found in the middle World, which unites and conjoins the great and little world; it is a Soul which unites and copulates the Spirit with the Body. This Soul is compared unto water, and it is a right true water, but not so that it wets as other water doth, but it is a Celestial water, dry, found in a Metallick Liquorish substance; it is a Soulish water, which loves all Spirits, and unites them with their Bodies, conducting them to a compleat Life; therefore it is reasonably found out, and evidently proved, that Water is the Mother of all Metals, which are heated by the warm aerial Fire, or Spirit of Sulphur, which by its digestion makes the Earthly Body lively, wherein the Salt is evidently found, which preserves from putrefaction, so that nothing Image 23 (page 42) might be consumed by Corruption. At the beginning and birth Quick-silver is first operated, which stands yet open with a subtile coagulation, because little Salt is imparted to it, whereby he manifests a more spiritual than corporal Body; but all the other Metals which follow out of its Essence, and have more Salt, whereby they become corporal, do all follow this; so that I now begin first with the Spirit of Mercury.   Page 43 CHAP. III. Of the Spirit of Mercury. THough I have a peculiar Stile in writing, which will seem strange unto many, causing strange Thoughts and Fancies in their Brains, yet there is reason enough for my so doing; I say enough, that I may remain by my own experience, not esteeming much of others prating, because it is concealed in my knowledge, Seeing having alwaies the preheminence before Hearing, and Reason hath the praise before Folly: Wherefore I now say, that all visible, tangible things are made of the Spirit of Mercury, which excels all earthly Image 24 (page 44) things of the whole world, all things being made out of it, having their Off-spring only from it; for all is found therein which can perform all whatsoever the Artist desires to find; It is the beginning to operate Metals, when it is become a spiritual Essence, which is meer Air flying to and fro without wings; it is a moving wind, which after it is expelled its dwelling by Vulcan, it is driven into its Chaos, where it again enters, and resolves it self into the Elements, where it is elevated and attracted by the Sydereal Stars after a Magnetical manner unto themselves, out of love, whence he proceeded before, and was operated, because it affects its like again, and attracts it to it. But if this Spirit of Mercury can be caught, and made corporal, it resolves into a Page 45 Body, and becomes a pure, clear, transparent water, which is the true spiritual water, and the first Mercurial Root of the Minerals and Metals, spiritual, intangible, incombustible, without any mixture of earthly aquosity; it is that Celestial water, whereof very much hath been written; for by this Spirit of Mercury all Metals, may if need require, be broken, opened, and resolved into their first Matter, without Corrosive; it renews the age of Man or Beast, even as the Eagles; it consumes all evil, and conducts a long Age to long Life. This Spirit of Mercury is the Master-Key of my Second Key, whereof I wrote in the beginning; wherefore I will call; Come ye Blessed of the Lord, be anointed, and refreshed with water, and embalm your Bodies, that they may not putrefie Image 25 (page 46) or stink; for this Celestial Water is the beginning, the Oyl, and the means, seeing it burns not, because it is made of a spiritual Sulphur; the Salt Balsam is corporal, which is united with the Water by the Oyl, whereof I will afterwards treat more at large, when I shall write of them, and mention them. And that I may further declare what is the Essence, Matter and Form of the Spirit of Mercury, I say, that its Essence is blessed, its Matter spiritual, and its form earthly, which yet must be understood by an incomprehensible way; these are indeed harsh Expressions, many will think, thy Proposals are all vain, strange Effusions, raising wonderful Imaginations, and true it is that they are strange, and require strange people to understand Page 47 these Sayings; it is not written for Peasants, how they should grease Cart-wheels, nor is it written unto those who have no knowledge of the Art, though they be never so learned, or think themselves so; for I only account them Learned, who next unto Gods Word, learn to know Earthly things, which must be pondered and judged by the Understanding, founded upon a true Knwledge, to distinguish Light from Darkness, who chuse that which is good, and reject the evil. It is needless for you to know what the beginning of this Spirit of Mercury requires, because it can in no wise help nor advantage you, only take notice of this, that its beginning is supernatural, out of the Celestial, Sydereal and Elementary, bestowed Image 26 (page 48) on it from the beginning of the first Creation, that it may enter further into an Earthly Substance. But because this is necessary which hath been declared to you, leave the Celestial to the Soul, apprehend it by Faith, and let the Sydereal likewise alone, because these Sydereal Impressions are invisible and intangible, the Elements have already brought forth the Spirit perfect into the world by the Nutriment, therefore let that alone likewise; for man cannot make the Elements, but only the Creator, and remain by thy made Spirit which is already formal and unformal, tangible and intangible, and yet is presented visibly. So have you enough of the first Matter, out of which all Metals and Minerals grow, and is one only thing, and such a Page 49 matter which unites it self with the Sulphur in the following Chapter, and enters into a Coagulation with the Salt of the fifth Chapter, that it may be one Body, and a perfect Medicine of all Metals, not only to bring forth in the Earth at the beginning, as in the great World, but also by help of the vaporous Body to transmute and change, together with the augmentation in the lesser World: Let not this seem strange to you, seeing the Most High hath permitted, and Nature undertaken it. Many will not believe this, esteeming it impossible, despise and vilifie these Mysteries, which they understand not in the least, they may remain Fools and Idiots till an illumination follows, which cannot be without Gods Will, but remains till the time Image 27 (page 50) predestinate. But wise and discreet, men who have truly shed the sweat of their Brows, will be my sufficient witnesses, and confirm the Truth, and indeed believe and hold for a truth all that which I write in this case, as true as Heaven and Hell are preordained, and proposed as Rewards of good and evil to the Elect and Reprobate. Now I write not only with my hands, but my Mind, Will and heart constrain me to it: Those who are highly conceited, illuminated, and world-wise, hate, envy, scandalize, defame and persecute this Mystery to the utmost Rind, or innermost Kernel, which hath its beginning out of the Center; but I know assuredly, there will come a time, when my Marrow is wasted, and my Bones dried up, that some will take my part Page 51 heartily, after I am in the Pit; and if God would permit it, they would willingly raise me from the dead; but that cannot be; wherefore I have left them my Writings, that their Faith and Hope may have a Seal of Certainty and Truth, to testifie of me what my last Will and Testament was, which I ordained for the poor, and all the Lovers of Mysteries, though it did not behove me to have wrote so much, yet I could not refrain without prejudice to my Soul, but to drive a Light or Flash through a Cloud, that the Day might be observed, and the dark Night, thick and gloomy, rainy Weather expelled. Now how the Archaeus operates further by the Spirit of Mercury in the Earth, or Veins of the Earth, take this Advice, Image 28 (page 52) that after the spiritual Seed is formed by the impression of the Stars from above, and fed by the Elements, it is a Seed, and turns it self into a Mercurial Water, as first of all the great World was made of nothing, for when the Spirit moved upon the Water, the Celestial Heat must needs raise a Life in the cold watrish and earthly Creatures; in the great World it was Gods Power, and the Operation of the Celestial Lights; in the little World it is likewise Gods Power, and the Operation to work into the Earth by his Divine and Holy Breath. Moreover the Almighty gave and Ordained means to accomplish it, that one Creature had obtained power to operate in the other, and the one to help and assist the other, to perform and Page 53 fulfil all the Works of the Lord; and so an influence was permitted the Earth to bring forth by the Lights of Heaven, as also an internal Heat, to warm and digest that which was too cold for the Earth, by reason of its humidity, as unto every Creature a peculiar fashion according to its kind; so that a subtile sulphurous Vapour, is stired up by the Starry Heaven, not the common, but another more clarified and pure Vapour, distinct from others, which unites it self with the Mercurial Substance; by whose warm property, in process of time, the superfluous Moisture is dryed up, and then when the soulish property comes to it, which gives a preservation to the Body and Balsam, operating first into the Earth by a spiritual and sydereal Image 29 (page 54) iufluence, then are Metals generated of it, as it pleaseth the Mixture of the three Principles, the Body being formed according as it assumes unto it the greatest part of those three. But if the Spirit of Mercury be intended and qualified from above upon Animals, it becomes an Animal Substance; if it goes upon Vegetables by order, it becomes a Vegetable Work; but if, by reason of its infused nature, it fall on Minerals, it becomes Minerals and Metals, yet each one hath its distinction as they are wrought, the Animals for themselves, the Vegetables on another manner and form by themselves, and so likewise the Minerals, each one a several way, whereof to write particularly would be too tedious, and yield large and various Narrations. Page 55 Many one may here demand and not without cause, how such a Spirit of Mercury may be procured, how to be made, and after what manner it is to be prepared to expel Diseases, and change all the kinds of the meaner and baser Metals, as if they were born in a little world, by transmutation and augmentation of their Seed; many expect this with impatience. I answer without concealing any thing, but will truly discover as much as is permitted me by Gods Command, in manner and form following. In the Name of the Lord, Take a Red Quick-silver Ore which is like unto Sinople (or Vermilion) and the best Gold Ore you can get; grind of each a like quantity both together, before they partake of any fire, poure an Image 30 (page 56) Oyl of Mercury upon it made per se, of common, purified and sublimed Quicksilver, set it a month to digest, you have an Extract rather Celestial than Terrestrial; distil this Extract gently, as in Balneum Mariae, the Flegme ascends over, the Oyl remaining at bottom, being heavy, which in a moment receives all Metals into it; poure thrice as much Spirit of Wine to it, circulate it in a Pellican, till it be as red as Bloud, and become so sweet that nothing may compare with it; decant the Spirit of Wine to a Liquidness, poure fresh Spirit of Wine upon it, this reiterate so often, till the Matter be exceeding sweet, and transparent red as a a Ruby, then put all together, poure that which ascended over upon white calcined Tartar, and distil, it strongly in Ashes, the Page 57 Spirit of Wine remains behind with the Tartar, but the Spirit of Mercury ascends over. If this Spirit of Mercury be mixt with the Spirit of Sulphur, together with its Salt, and so brought over jointly together, that they can never be separated, you have such a work which if it come over, and it get its ferment with Gold by solution according to a just measure and time appointed, and be brought to a perfect ripeness, unto the Plusquam perfection, nothing may compare therewith, for prevention of Diseases, and poverty, and to a rich excessive recreation of the Body and Goods. This is the way to obtain the Spirit of Mercury, which I have revealed as far as it is permitted me to do, by the Supremest Emperour; the Image 31 (page 58) Manual Operations are found in the Work which I have revealed; you must wisely observe, that you may not endure a Bath in Hell for me, by my true admonition to thee, forasmuch as a true opening of the Door which leads to the Royal Palace, is performed but with one Key, which cures all Diseases, be it Dropsie, Consumption, Gout, Stone, Falling Sickness, Apoplexy, Leprosie, or howsoever called in general: This Medicine likewise cures all kinds of the French Pox, and all old Sores of long standing, be it Wolf, Noli me tangere, Letter, Ring-worm, Cancer, Fistula, and corroding hollow Sores; all which I have declared, and concealed nothing. Last of all, observe, that you do not discover too much, or no more, because Page 59 all Art hath its Original or Source out of the Spirit of Mercury, which is refreshed and raised to Life by the spiritual Sulphur, that it becomes Celestial, & with and by the Salt they are made corporal and formal; but the beginning of the Soul, of the Spirit, and of the Body, let it be and remain a Magnet, even as it is, and can be acknowledged to be nothing else. This is the summe in brief, that without the Spirit of Mercury, which is the only true Key, you can never make Corporal Gold potable, nor the Philosophers Stone. Let it remain by this Conclusion, be silent; for I my self will at present say no more, because Silence is enjoyned thee and me by the orderly Judge, recommending the Execution and Image 32 (page 60) further, Search thereof to another, who hath not as yet reduced the Matter into a right Order.   Page 61 CHAP. IV. Of the Spirit of Copper. THE Star of Venus is very difficult, and not well to be calculated, as all Mathematicians and Astronomers will bear me witness; for its course is found to be otherwise than that of the other six Planets, and therefore its Birth is otherwise; for the Birth of Venus possesses the First Table, after Mercury, as for what concerns the Generation of Metals. Mercury makes active, but Venus provokes, giving Lust and Desire, together with the Beauty which gave occasionth ereunto; though I am accounted no Astronomer, nor do Image 33 (page 62) I give my self out for one, who knows to calculate the Course of the Heavens; for I should spend my time in my Cell in Prayer, but that the spare hours after my Devotion is ended, may not be spent in vain, I have ordered and proposed it as my aim and intent to exercise my self, and to spend those hours in the knowledge of Natural things. So likewise it is not well to be reckoned what arises, grows or proceeds from Venus, or whence she arose, grew, or proceeded; for she is superfluously cloathed more than she needs, and yet must want that which she needs most of all in her Constancy. But you must be advertised, that Venus is cloathed with a Celestial Sulphur, which far surpasses the brightness of the Sun; for there is more and more abundant Page 63 Sulphur in her than in Gold; but it requires a knowledge what the Matter of that Gold Sulphur may be, which is, and rules so plentifully in Copper, and whereof I make so great a Cry: know then that it is likewise a flying very hot Spirit, which can pass through and penetrate, as also ripen and digest all things, as the imperfect Metals into perfect, which the inexpert will not believe. And here a Question presents it self at hand; How the Spirit of Copper can make other imperfect Metals perfect, and make them ripe, whereas in its own Body it is imperfect and inconstant? For Answer, I say as I have often said, that this Spirit cannot possess or inhabit a permanent Body in Copper; for when the habitation is burnt by Fire, the Spirit goes away with it, and must Image 34 (page 64) with impatience leave its Lodging, for it dwells therein as a Sojourner; but it hath protection in the permanent fix'd Body of Gold, whence no man can expel it, without the Warrant of an especial Judge; for it is put into the inheritance as an Heir, and taken Root by her permanent Body, that she cannot easily be expelled. The Tincture which Venus hath obtained, is in like manner found in Mars, more powerful, high and Noble; for Mars is the Man, and Venus the Woman, which I speak more of, seeing I write of them. This Tincture is delivered in Verdigreece, and likewise it is found in Vitriol, as in a Mineral whereof a peculiar Book might be wrote. In all these things a combustible Sulphur is found, and yet a Sulphur which is incombustible, this Page 65 is a strange thing, one is a white Sulphur, the other is red in the operative generation; but the true Sulphur is incombustible, for it is a pure true Spirit, whereof an incombustible Oil is prepared, and it is the same Sulphur which is made out of one Root from the Gold-Sulphur. I open many Mysteries, which ought not to be; but what should I do? to conceal all is not answerable, but a measure is good in all things, as you may observe in my last Advice of protestation; forget not my desire therein. This Sulphur may well be called the Sulphur of the Wise; for all Wisdom is found therein, unto the Mercurial Spirit which excels it, which together with the Salt of Mars must be put together by a spiritual Conjunction, Image 35 (page 66) that three may come into one understanding, and be advanced to equal operations. This spiritual Sulphur proceeds in the same manner and form out of the upper Region, as doth the Spirit of Mercury, but in another manner and kind, whereby the Stars manifest a separation in fix'd and unfix'd, in colour'd and uncolour'd things. The Tincture consists only in the Spirit of Copper, and most of all in that of his Bed-fellow; it is a meer Vapour, stinking and ill-sented in its beginning; this Mist must be dissolved in the manner of a Liquor, that the stinking, incombustible Oil may be prepared thereof; but yet it must have and take its beginning out of Mars; this Oil unites freely with the Spirit of Mercury, assuming all Metallick Bodies speedily Page 67 unto them, if they be first prepared in all points as I have advised in my Keys. I observe not the Order of the Planets, and not without just grounds; for I observe the order of their Birth, by which I am directed; for because Venus hath much Sulphur, she is sooner digested and ripened together with Mars, before other Metals; but because unconstant Mercury shewed them both too little assistance, therefore no room is left him to work harder, by reason of the superfluous Sulphur, so that they could obtain no melioration of their unfixt Bodies. Now I will reveal a Secret unto thee, that Gold, Copper, and Iron have one Sulphur, one Tincture, and one Matter of their Colour; this Matter of the Tincture is a Spirit, a Mist and Fume, as aforesaid, Image 36 (page 68) which can penetrate and pass through all Bodies, if you can take it, and acuate it by the Spirit which is in the Salt of Mars, and then conjoin the Spirit of Mercury therewith in a just weight, purging them from all impurity, that they be pleasant and well sented, without all Corrosives, you have then such a Medicine, whereunto none in the world may compare, being fermented with the bright shining Sun, you have made an entrance penetrating to work, and to transmute all Metals. O Eternal Wisdom from the beginning! how shall we thank thee for such great Mysteries, which the Children of Men do no wayes regard, but are despised by the greater number, to know what thou hast concealed in Nature, which they see before Page 69 their Eyes, and know it not; they have it in their Hands, and comprehend it not; they deal with it, and know not what they have, nor what they do, because the Internal is concealed. I will yet reveal this unto thee in truth, and by the Love of God, that the root of the Philosophical Sulphur, which is a Celestial Spirit, is found with the root of the spiritual supernatural Mercury, as also the beginning of the spiritual Salt, are in one, and found in one Matter, out of which the Stone is made, which was before me, and not in many things, though all Philosphers speak as if the Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt were each one a part by themselves and distinct, that the Mercury is found in one, the Sulphur in another, and the Salt in a third; yet I tell you, this is only Image 37 (page 70) to be understood of their superfiuity, which is found to abound most in each, and may be used and prepared divers ways particularly with profit, both for Physick and transmutation of Metals; but the Universal, which is the supreamest Treasure of Earthly Wisdom, and of all the three Principles, is one only thing, and is founded and extracted out of one only thing, which can make all Metals into one, it is the true Spirit of Mercury, and Soul of Sulphur, together with the spiritual Salt, united together, inclosed under one Heaven, and dwelling in one Body, it is the Dragon and the Eagle, the King and the Lion, the Spirit and the Body, which must tinge the Body of Gold ""o a Medtcine"

Image 33 (unnumbered page) Unnumbered page TO THE READER; But Especially to his Brethren the Apothecaries of LONDON. SIRS, If the unspotted innocency of an Action (as to the rendring of a prejudice) be a sufficient Barricado to oppose the thundring and pell-mell Granadoes of impertinent Contradiction, and malevolent Censure, we question not but this harmless Essay of our early Lucubrations may withstand the first Lash of the Criticks Rod, and in some measure mitigate, if not gag or stop the rigidness of your Censures; or at least induce your Charity to connive at our imbecillity, by glancing through the Lattice of a diminishing Telescope. The advantage and commodement of the publick in general, was the perfect Achme of this enterprise, in trimming our Author in this Garb, to which, if these endeavours adde but one grain, or Atome, (though scattered by the hands of weather-beaten Imperfection) we shall acknowledge it not onely the Heroick Carac, but also the Laureat Apex of our Glory. Doubtless (Sirs) this was the fundamental Syntax of our thoughts, to which we determined the designation of Image 34 (unnumbered page)this Translation: but we presume it may meet with a greater influence upon your Acceptations, as most congruous to your stations, being the professed Sons of Apollo, soaring in the highest sphear of Natures Oeconomy, inhabiting the Thurisick Groves of Rerum Natura, attending the sproutings of their variegated Offspring. The benefit you may receive hereby (after some serious exagitation) we partly understand by the glimpse of that more than ordinary Illustration our formerly clouded Genius is now bespangled with. The peroration, as to reversion of that utility which may by futurity accrew, here imploreth (Sirs) both your resentment and communication. Can any Copy be so gratefull to ingenious persons, than that whose stamp appears in the beaten path of Antiquity? wherein there is no Jurgia Mentis to pertarr your cogitations from delabing through the Golden Chanels of Experience. Sirs, here you will finde the confused Recipes, and linsy-woolsy-conceptions of Physicians ranged into an exact method, their Enigmatical expressions unforked and unvailed, their cloudy sentences artionobolized into rayes of Light. Ignorance beskreens the soul, here our Author discovers the dawnings of knowledge, by breaking open the hidden Caverns of Nature, and explaining the secreta, or occult qualities of her multifarious Vegetables. Here the whole Pharmaceutical Art is denuded, and redacted to the clear intelligence of the meanest capacity, claiming your attentions, whil'st it affords instructions to conduct you to a clear prospect of Via recta ad vitam longam, promising a Medicine for every Malady, and a Balm for every Soar. Here you may behold Phoebus skipping from the Bowers of Neptune, and by his darting through the Casements of Heaven, gracing the cincture of the day with his radiant complexion, glistering with Robes of silver, shooting life and Unnumbered pagespirit by his beams into the fruits of the Earth. Here you may see our Author traversing many lofty Heaven aspiring Mountains, and anon conducting you into the pleasant Penaean Valleys. Here you may sit upon the diapred brim of the Universe, and accumulate Nose-gayes of Roses and Gilliflowers, Medicines for scent and savour, cordial and reviving. Here you may view how this lofty Turret the Earth is bespread with Daffadils and Prime-roses, Cowslips and Columbine; and the Amber Locks of Ver dallying with the Eglantine Banks of Bravery. Here you may view the superbious Trees presuming to elevate their tops in the sacred Skyes, In the three Books of Medicinal Materials. the delicious Bowers of the Woods adorned with the Treasure of Flora's bespangled Drapery, the curled Growes rattling with the bloomy gales, the verdant Leaves flourishing, the Silver streams of pleasant Rivers gliding, the flagrant Meadows braving it with the riches of Autumn, displaying the pride of their beauty; the pleasant Umbrages sporting with Zephyrus-Nectar-Blooms, shining with Titan's transpiercing Darts; and the whole Garden of the Universe embellished with curious Tapestry, glistering Ingeny, and interchangeable Jollity. Here may you see Rhenodaeus plowing through the liquid Intrals of Nereus, dancing Lovalto's upon the azured waves, making Amphitrite display a delicate apparition of Paphian allurement, discovering as it were the stately Battlements of the Mint of Mexico, and the Minerals of Peru; the nature of the Porphyrie, with the virtue of the Saphyre, the Carbuncle with the Topaz, the Emerald with the Chrysolite, the Smaragd with the Margarite. Millions of thanks to debonaire Fortune, that these Ambrosian Delicacies are discovered, before the Postilions of Eolus have fled to Neptune's azured Common-wealth, and our Horizon over-veiled with the Canopie of drousy Vesper (Ignorance.) Image 35 (unnumbered page) In a word, here may you view the enamelled Robe of the Universe, Lady like, spotted with its rosy-locks; whose hair doth not more adorn than profit; whose ruby cheeks are not more admired for their beauty, than for their salubrious virtues desired; whose frank, free, fragrant, and fruitfull Breasts do nourish her own Children sprung from her never resting womb, affording nourishment both to Man and Beast. Insomuch that we may well cry out with Du Bartas; 'Good Lord! how many gasping Souls have scap't 'By th'aid of Herbs, for whom the Grave hath gap't; 'Who even about to touch the Stygian Strand, 'Have yet beguil'd grim Pluto's greedy hand. 'O sacred Simples, that our Life sustain, 'And when it flyes, can call it back again; ''Tis not alone your Liquor inly tane, 'That oft defends us from so many a bane; 'But even your savour, yea, your neighbourhood, 'For some diseases is exceeding good. 'O great is the powerfull Good that lyes 'In Herbs, Trees, Stones, and their true qualities: 'For nought so vile, that on the Earth doth live, 'But to the Earth some secret good doth give; 'And nought so rich, on either Rock or Shelf, 'But, if unknown, lyes useless to it self, 'Therefore who thus doth make his Secrets known, 'Doth profit others, but not hurt his own. Sirs, Communication is the primo-genito of Goodness; and why should so singular a benefit longer lye hid? Doth not the immense Excellency of Eternity delight himself in expanding the beams of his Goodness? and why should the younger Sister, the Sun-burned beauty of Knowledge, and Science sublunar, be encloystered within the obscure verge of a forreign Language, barbarous, and almost inexplicable Unnumbered pageIdiome? Undoubtedly (Brethren) Heaven will follow it with a correspondency of Blessings. We desire not (Sirs) to degrade, or go about to darken the splendour, or obstruct the luster of the Oriency of that never fading Crown due to the Seraphick Founts of Learning; but to exclaim (and not without cause) against the Saturnine tyrannie of such, whose endeavours are to monopolize all Arts and Sciences in an uncouth Magazine, and to inhance them, as by Letter-Patent, locking them up, with the feculent bolts of Self-exaltation, beyond the usual extension of vulgar Capacities, not allowing them the priviledge to peep within the veil. How many thousands of poor Wretches that are arrested by the virulent malignity of a distemper, and by its creeping Gangrena, preposterously hurried into the boats of Charon; whereas a small matter, and it may be, a Plant sprouting at their own doors, might dissipate its vehemency at its first onset, if throughly understood, and rightly applyed. Was it not the practice of the Heathens Magi, Damones, and Sophoi, to captive the People under the hatches of blindness? and did they not receive the just Guerdon of fallacy? Shall Science be a peculiar mans property? God forbid. Is not Salus Populi the Pallisado of Republicks? and Experience Corona Scientiarum? It importeth you, Sirs, whom God hath called in a peculiar manner to be as it were his Vice-gerents, to operate in things about life and death, to endeavour a promotion of the former, by preparing fitly Natures Offspring for convenient and suitable Nutriment to so sublime a subject; and to increase the latter, by making confused things (every where occurrent) distinct; and abstruse, obvious. Sirs, you live in a City, which the Eternal Being hath bedubbed and adorned with variety of blessings, clarified Intellectuals, and well polished Judgements; you are subservient Image 36 (unnumbered page)to the refinedst Artists under the Cope of Heaven, crowned with never-fading-Palms, for their boundless knowledge in the Botannick Art. What Plant is there in the fertile womb of the Earth, that is not now found out, and known? What glistering and shining Stars do daily, appear in your Horizon? Can every age boast of a Gerard, Parkinson, or Johnson? what an incomparable Cheapside. Garden have you hourly access unto, which may contend with the greatest part of the World for Glory, Beauty, and Variety! and shall not these Considerations alarm you? you that are called Opiferque per Orbem, to demonstrate your zeal to your Native Countrey, by discovering in intelligible Characters, the virtues, properties and qualities of such Simples as this Climate is luxuriant with; which (Sirs) would be an overflourishing Herald to emblazon your Escutcheons without Star, half Moon, spot, or blemish; and eternize your names in indelible stamps, upon the pinnacle of Fame; and when your Works shall redeem sick consumed persons from their expected Coffins, you shall be adored as so many Deities adumbrated in bodies of flesh. Be ye the Golden Heliotropes of Gods right hand, shutting and opening at his good will and pleasure, not wrapping your Talents in the Napkin of secresy, but rather laying out your endeavours for the good of your Countrey. Then would exotical Plants submit to the excellency of domestick Simples; and homebred remedies be sought after for homebred diseases. You cannot be ignorant what calumnies of late have been hurled upon both Physicians and Apothecaries; the cause of such detraction is Ignorance. Successit odium in Literas ab Ignorantia vulgi. Which Junius well perceived. And can these men judge of a Scholars worth and pains, that are not acquainted with study-labours? That long since unforked dilemma Unnumbered pageof Pliny hath often been revived, and to this day fostered; which is thus stated; Every Disease is either curable or incurable; a man either recovers of it, or is killed by it; both wayes Physick is to be rejected; if it be deadly, it cannot be cured; if it may be helped, it requires no Physick, Nature will expell it of it self. Doubtless (Sirs) it concerns you to dispell such Clouds, seeing some have been so impudent to hold, that it is no Art at all, nor worthy the name of a Liberal Science, as Pet, and Canouherius, a Patrician of Rome, and a famous Doctor, goes about to prove by 16 Arguments; because it is mercenary, as now adayes used, as Fidlers play for a reward; and that the Devil himself was the first Inventor of it. Inventum est Medicina meum, said Apollo. Neither have the Paracelsian Order (as so many Promethei that would fetch Fire from Heaven) the least share in these Contumelacies: how are Galen and Hippocrates (who were the first that ever writ of Physick to any purpose) censured by them, for immethodical and obscure, terming their Medicines obsolete, and their Precepts confused, and for the most part rejected by them, calling them Mountebanks, Empericks, Impostors, Infants, Idiots, Sophisters, and such like, not worthy the name of Physicians, who were not versed in the knowledge of such Remedies as they had, boasting that he himself could make a man live 160 years by his Alexipharmacums, Panacea's, Mumia's, Unguentum Armarium, and such Magnetical Cures; Lampas vitae & mortis, Balneum Dianae, Balsamum, Electrum, Magieo-Physicum, Amulets, Martiala. What will not he (who stiles himself Theophrastus, Hariolum, Bombastum, Hohanhein) and his Disciples effect? He proclaims himself to be Primus Medicorum, and did more famous Cures than all Physicians in Europe, vapouring that a drop of his Preparations should go further than an ounce of theirs. How is Galen taxed by Cardan (without a due consideration Image 37 (unnumbered page)of his worth) for presuming out of his Ambition (as he terms it) to correct Theriacum Andromachi? and why there must be just so many Simples in Mithridate; and why such and such a quantity. How are the Receipts of Myrepsius, Mesue, Celsus, Scribanius, Actuarius, and others, for the most part now condemned and neglected? Every private man must have his own Compositions and Magisterials, as if he scorned Antiquity; each fellow must correct and alter, to shew his skill, and maintain his own Paradox, be it what it will, and in the mean time the Patients must pay for their new Experiments. But we will not urge these cavilling Arguments any further, we hope (Sirs) you understand the frothiness of such Positions, and that you will be ready to vindicate it from such Aspersions, and acknowledge it to be a noble and divine Science; insomuch that Apollo, Esculapius, and the first Founders of it, merito pro diis habiti, were worthily accounted Gods by succeeding ages. Are we not enjoyned to honour the Physician for necessity sake? Ecclesiasticus 18.3. The knowledge of the Physician lifteth up his head, and in the sight of great men he shall be admired; the Lord hath created Medicines of the earth, and he that is wise will not abhor them. Let such prattle what they will, mixed Diseases must have mixed Remedies. It is a most noble invention, saith Quercitan, found out and brought into Physick with great judgement, counsel, wisdome and discretion, so that the greatness of the Composition bespeaks the elegancy of the Medicine. For Brass vola and Cardan maintain, Nullum Medicamentum simplex esse sine no""a: Therefore in every Composition such Simples are mixed as have affinity to the part affected"

W. Newcastle.   Unnumbered page TO HIS EXCELLENCY The LORD MARQUIS of NEW CASTLE. My Noble Lord, ALthough you have always encouraged me in my harmless pastime of Writing, yet was I afraid that your Lordship would be angry with me for Writing and Publishing this Book, by reason it is a Book of Controversies, of which I have heard your Lordship say, That Controversies and Disputations make Enemies of Friends, and that such Disputations and Controversies as these, are a pedantical kind of quarrelling, not becoming Noble Persons. But your Lordship will be pleased to consider in my behalf, that it is impossible for one Person to be of every one's Opinion, if their opinions be different, and that my Opinions in Philosophy, being new, and never thought of, at least not divulged by any, but my self, are quite different from others: For the Ground of my Opinions is, that there is not onely a Sensitive, but also a Rational Life and Knowledge, and so a double Perception in all Creatures: And thus my opinions being new, are not so easily understood as those, that take vp several pieces of old opinions, Image 4 (unnumbered page) of which they patch up a new Philosophy, (if new may be made of old things,) like a Suit made up of old Stuff bought at the Brokers: Wherefore to find out a Truth, at least a Probability in Natural Philosophy by a new and different way from other Writers, and to make this way more known, easie and intelligible, I was in a manner forced to write this Book; for I have not contradicted those Authors in any thing, but what concerns and is opposite to my opinions; neither do I any thing, but what they have done themselves, as being common amongst them to contradict each other: which may as well be allowable, as for Lawyers to plead at the Barr in opposite Causes. For as Lawyers are not Enemies to each other, but great Friends, all agreeing from the Barr, although not at the Barr: so it is with Philosophers, who make their Opinions as their Clients, not for Wealth, but for Fame, and therefore have no reason to become Enemies to each other, by being Industrious in their Profession. All which considered, was the cause of Publishing this Book; wherein although I dissent from their opinions, yet doth not this take off the least of the respect and esteem I have of their Merits and Works. But if your Lordship do but pardon me, I care not if I be condemned by others; for your Favour is more then the World to me, for which all the actions of my Life shall be devoted and ready to serve you, as becomes, My LORD, Your Lordships honest Wife, and humble Servant, M.

May Heaven prosper you, the World magnifie you, and Eternity record your fame; Which are the hearty wishes and prayers of, Your most obliged Servant M. NEWCASTLE.   Unnumbered page A PREFACE TO THE READER. Worthy Readers, I Did not write this Book out of delight, love or humour to contradiction; for I would rather praise, then contradict any Person or Persons that are ingenious; but by reason Opinion is free, and may pass without a pass-port, I took the liberty to declare my own opinions as other Philosophers do, and to that purpose I have here set down several famous and learned Authors opinions, and my answers to them in the form of Letters, which was the easiest way for me to write; and by so doing, I have done that, which I would have bone unto me; for I am as willing to have my opinions contradicted, as I do contradict others: for I love Reason so well, that whosoever can bring most rational and probable arguments, shall have my vote, although Image 6 (unnumbered page) against my own opinion. But you may say, If contradictions were frequent, there would be no agreement amongst Mankind. I answer; It is very true: Wherefore Contradictions are better in general Books, then in particular Families, and in Schools better then in Publick States, and better in Philosophy then in Divinity. All which considered, I shun, as much as I can, not to discourse or write of either Church or State. But I desire so much favour, or rather Justice of you, Worthy Readers, as not to interpret my objections or answers any other ways then against several opinions in Philosophy; for I am confident there is not any body, that doth esteem, respect and honour learned and ingenious Persons more then I do: Wherefore judg me neither to be of a contradicting humor, nor of a vain-glorious mind for dissenting from other mens opinions, but rather that it is done out of love to Truth, and to make my own opinions the more intelligible, which cannot better be done then by arguing and comparing other mens opinions with them. The Authors whose opinions I mention, I have read, as I found them printed, in my native Language, except Des Cartes, who being in Latine, I had some few places translated to me out of his works; and I must confess, that since I have read the works of these learned men, I understand the names and terms of Art a little better then I did before; but it is not so much as to make me a Scholar, nor yet so little, but that, had I read more before I did begin to write my other Book called Philosophical Opinions, they would have been more intelligible; for my error was, I began to write so early, that I had not liv'd Unnumbered page so long as to be able to read many Authors; I cannot say, I divulged my opinions as soon as I had conceiv'd them, but yet I divulged them too soon to have them artificial and methodical, But since what is past, cannot be recalled, I must desire you to excuse those faults, which were committed for want of experience and learning. As for School-learning, had I applied my self to it, yet I am confident I should never have arrived to any; for I am so uncapable of Learning, that I could never attain to the knowledge of any other Language but my native, especially by the Rules of Art: wherefore I do not repent that I spent not my time in Learning, for I consider, it is better to write wittily then learnedly; nevertheless, I love and esteem Learning, although I am not capable of it. But you may say, I have expressed neither Wit nor Learning in my Writings: Truly, if not, I am the more sorry for it; but selfconceit, which is natural to mankind, especially to our Sex, did flatter and secretly perswade me that my Writings had Sense and Reason, Wit and Variety; but Judgment being not called to Counsel, I yielded to Selfconceits flattery, and so put out my Writings to be Printed as fast as I could, without being reviewed or corrected: Neither did I fear any censure, for Selfconceit had perswaded me, I should be highly applauded; wherefore I made such haste, that I had three or four Books printed presently after each other. But to return to this present Work, I must desire you, worthy Readers, to read first my Book called Philosophical and Physical Opinions, before you censure this, for this Book is but an explanation of the former, wherein is contained the Ground of my Opinions, and those Image 7 (unnumbered page) that will judge well of a Building, must first consider the Foundation; to which purpose I will repeat some few Heads and Principles of my Opinions, which are these following: First, That Nature is Infinite, and the Eternal Servant of God: Next, That she is Corporeal, and partly self-moving, dividable and composable; that all and every particular Creature, as also all perception and variety in Nature, is made by corporeal self-motion, which I name sensitive and rational matter, which is life and knowledg, sense and reason. Again, That these sensitive and rational parts of matter are the purest and subtilest parts of Nature, as the active parts, the knowing, understanding and prudent parts, the designing, architectonical and working parts, nay, the Life and Soul of Nature, and that there is not any Creature or part of nature without this Life and Soul; and that not onely Animals, but also Vegetables, Minerals and Elements, and what more is in Nature, are endued with this Life and Soul, Sense and Reason: and because this Life and Soul is a corporeal Substance, it is both dividable and composable; for it divides and removes parts from parts, as also composes and joyns parts to parts, and works in a perpetual motion without rest; by which actions not any Creature can challenge a particular Life and Soul to it self, but every Creature may have by the dividing and composing nature of this self-moving matter more or fewer natural souls and lives. These and the like actions of corporeal Nature or natural Matter you may find more at large described in my afore-mentioned Book of Philosophical Opinions, and more clearly repeated and explained in this present. Unnumbered page Tis true, the way of arguing I use, is common, but the Principles, Heads and Grounds of my Opinions are my own, not borrowed or stolen in the least from any; and the first time I divulged them, was in the year 1653. since which time I have reviewed, reformed and reprinted them twice; for at first, as my Conceptions were new and my own, so my Judgment was young, and my Experience little, so that I had not so much knowledge as to declare them artificially and methodically; for as I mentioned before, I was always unapt to learn by the Rules of Art. But although they may be defective for want of Terms of Art, and artificial expressions, yet I am sure they are not defective for want of Sense and Reason: And if any one can bring more Sense and Reason to disprove these my opinions, I shall not repine or grieve, but either acknowledge my errour, if I find my self in any, or defend them as rationally as I can, if it be but done justly and honestly, without deceit, spight, or malice; for I connot chuse but acquaint you, Noble Readers, I have been informed, that if I should be answered in my Writings, it would be done rather under the name and cover of a Woman, then of a Man, the reason is, because no man dare or will set his name to the contradiction of a Lady; and to confirm you the better herein, there has one Chapter of my Book called The Worlds Olio, treating of a Monastical Life, been answer'd already in a little Pamphlet, under the name of a woman, although she did little towards it; wherefore it being a Hermaphroditical Book, I judged it not worthy taking notice of. The like shall I do to any other that will answer this present work of mine, or contradict my opinions indirectly with fraud and deceit. Image 8 (unnumbered page) But I cannot conceive why it should be a disgrace to any man to maintain his own or others opinions against a woman, so it be done with respect and civility; but to become a cheat by dissembling, and quit the Breeches for a Petticoat, meerly out of spight and malice, is base, and not fit for the honour of a man, or the masculine sex. Besides, it will easily be known; for a Philosopher or Philosopheress is not produced on a sudden. Wherefore, although I do not care, nor fear contradiction, yet I desire it may be done without fraud or deceit, spight and malice; and then I shall be ready to defend my opinions the best I can, whilest I live, and after I am dead, I hope those that are just and honorable will also defend me from all sophistry, malice, spight and envy, for which Heaven will bless them. In the mean time, Worthy Readers, I should rejoyce to see that my Works are acceptable to you, for if you be not partial, you will easily pardon those faults you find, when you do consider both my sex and breeding; for which favour and justice, I shall always remain, Your most obliged Servant, M. N.    Unnumbered page Image 9 (unnumbered page) Page 1 Philosophical Letters.  SECT. 1.  1. MADAM, YOu have been pleased to send me the Works of four Famous and Learned Authors, to wit, of two most Famous Philosophers of our Age, Des Gartes, and Hobbs, and of that Learned Philosopher and Divine Dr. More, as also of that Famous Physician and Chymist Van Helmont. Which Works you have sent me not onely to peruse, but also to give my judgment of them, and to send you word by the usual way of our Correspondence, which is by Letters, how far, and wherein I do dissent from these Famous Authors, their Opinions in Natural Philosophy. To tell you truly, Madam, your Commands did at first much affright me, for it did appear, as if you had commanded me to get upon a high Rock, and fling my self into the Sea, Image 10 (page 2) where neither a Ship, nor a Plank, nor any kind of help was near to rescue me, and save my life; but that I was forced to sink, by reason I cannot swim: So I having no Learning nor Art to assist me in this dangerous undertaking, thought, I must of necessity perish under the rough censures of my Readers, and be not onely accounted a fool for my labour, but a vain and presumptuous person, to undertake things surpassing the ability of my performance; but on the other side I considered first, that those Worthy Authors, were they my censurers, would not deny me the same liberty they take themselves; which is, that I may dissent from their Opinions, as well as they dissent from others, and from amongst themselves: And if I should express more Vanity then Wit, more Ignorance then Knowledg, more Folly then Discretion, it being according to the Nature of our Sex, I hoped that my Masculine Readers would civilly excuse me, and my Female Readers could not justly condemn me. Next I considered with my self, that it would be a great advantage for my Book called Philosophical Opinions, as to make it more perspicuous and intelligible by the opposition of other Opinions, since two opposite things placed near each other, are the better discerned; for I must confess, that when I did put forth my Philosophical Work at first, I was not so well skilled in the Terms or Expressions usual in Natural Philosophy; and therefore for want of their knowledg, I could not declare my meaning so plainly and clearly as I ought to have done, which may be a sufficient argument to my Readers, that I have not read heretofore any Natural Philosophers, and taken some Light from them; but that my Opinions did meerly Page 3 issue from the Fountain of my own Brain, without any other help or assistance. Wherefore since for want of proper Expressions, my named Book of Philosophy was accused of obscurity and intricacy, I thought your Commands would be a means to explain and clear it the better, although not by an Artificial way, as by Logical Arguments or Mathematical Demonstrations, yet by expressing my Sense and Meaning more properly and clearly then I have done heretofore: But the chief reason of all was, the Authority of your Command, which did work so powerfully with me, that I could not resist, although it were to the disgrace of my own judgment and wit; and therefore I am fully resoved now to go on as far, and as well as the Natural strength of my Reason will reach: but since neither the strength of my Body, nor of my understanding, or wit, is able to mark every line, or every word of their works, and to argue upon them, I shall onely pick out the ground Opinions of the aforementioned Authors, and those which do directly dissent from mine, upon which I intend to make some few Reflections, according to the ability of my Reason; and I shall meerly go upon the bare Ground of Natural Philosophy, and not mix Divinity with it, as many Philosophers use to do, except it be in those places, where I am forced by the Authors Arguments to reflect upon it, which yet shall be rather with an expression of my ignorance, then a positive declaration of my opinion or judgment thereof; for I think it not onely an absurdity, but an injury to the holy Profession of Divinity to draw her to the Proofs in Natural Philosophy; wherefore I shall strictly follow the Guidance of Natural Reason, and keep to my own ground and Principles as much as I can; Image 11 (page 4) which that I may perform the better, I humbly desire the help and assistance of your Favour, that according to that real and intire Affection you bear to me, you would be pleased to tell me unfeignedly, if I should chance to err or contradict but the least probability of truth in any thing; for I honor Truth so much, as I bow down to its shadow with the greatest respect and reverence; and I esteem those persons most, that love and honor Truth with the same zeal and fervor, whether they be Ancient or Modern Writers. Thus, Madam, although I am destitute of the help of Arts, yet being supported by your Favour and wise Directions, I shall not fear any smiles of scorn, or words of reproach; for I am confident you will defend me against all the mischievous and poisonous Teeth of malitious detractors. I shall besides, implore the assistance of the Sacred Church, and the Learned Schools, to take me into their Protection, and shelter my weak endeavours: For though I am but an ignorant and simple Woman, yet I am their devoted and honest Servant, who shall never quit the respect and honor due to them, but live and die theirs, as also, MADAM, Your Ladiships humble and faithful Servant.   Page 5 II. MADAM, BEfore I begin my Reflections upon the Opinions of those Authors you sent me, I will answer first your Objection concerning the Ground of my Philosophy, which is Infinite Matter: For you were pleased to mention, That you could not well apprehend, how it was possible, that many Infinites could be contained in one Infinite, since one Infinite takes up all Place Imaginary, leaving no room for any other; Also, if one Infinite should be contained in an other Infinite, that which contains, must of necessity be bigger then that which is contained, whereby the Nater of Infinite would be lost; as having no bigger nor less, but being of an Infinite quantity. First of all, Madam, there is no such thing as All in Infinite, nor any such thing as All the Place, for Infinite is not circumscribed nor limited: Next, as for that one Infinite cannot be in an other Infinite, I answer, as well as one Finite can be in another Finite; for one Creature is not onely composed of Parts, but one Part lies within another, and one Figure within another, and one Motion within another. As for example, Animal Kind, have they not Internal and External Parts, and so Internal and External Motions? And are not Animals, Vegetables and Minerals inclosed in the Elements? But as for Infinites, you must know, Madam, that there are several kindes of Infinites. For there is first Infinite in quantity Image 12 (page 6) or bulk, that is such a big and great Corporeal substance, which exceeds all bounds and limits of measure, and may be called Infinite in Magnitude. Next there is Infinite in Number, which exceeds all numeration and account, and may be termed Infinite in Multitude; Again there is Infinite in Quality; as for example, Infinite degrees of softness, hardness, thickness, thinness, heat and cold, &c. also Infinite degrees of Motion, and so Infinite Creations, Infinite Compositions, Dissolutions, Contractions, Dilations, Digestions, Expulsions; also Infinite degrees of Strength, Knowledg, Power, &c. Besides there is Infinite in Time, which is properly named Eternal. Now, when I say, that there is but one Infinite, and that Infinite is the Onely Matter, I mean infinite in bulk and quantity. And this Onely matter, because it is Infinite in bulk, must of necessity be divisible into infinite Parts, that is, infinite in number, not in bulk or quantity; for though Infinite Parts in number make up one infinite in quantity, yet they considered in themselves, cannot be said Infinite, because every Part is of a certain limited and circumscribed Figure, Quantity and Proportion, whereas Infinite hath no limits nor bounds: besides it is against the nature of a single Part to be Infinite, or else there would be no difference between the Part and the whole, the nature of a Part requiring that it must be less then its whole, but all what is less hath a determined quantity, and so becomes finite. Therefore it is no absurdity to say, that an Infinite may have both Finite and Infinite Parts, Finite in Quantity, Infinite in Number. But those that say, if there were an Infinite Body, that each of its Parts must of necessity be Infinite too, are much mistaken; for it is a contradiction Page 7 in the same Terms to say One Infinite Part, for the very Name of a Part includes a Finiteness, but take all parts of an Infinite Body together, then you may rightly say they are infinite. Nay Reason will inform you plainly, for example: Imagine an Infinite number of grains of Corn in one heap, surely if the number of Grains be Infinite, you must grant of necessity the bulk or body, which contains this infinite number of grains, to be Infinite too; to wit, Infinite in quantity, and yet you will find each Grain in it self to be Finite. But you will say, an Infinite Body cannot have parts, for if it be Infinite, it must be Infinite in Quantity, and therefore of one bulk, and one continued quantity, but Infinite parts in number make a discrete quantity. I answer it is all one; for a Body of a continued quantity may be divided and severed into fo many Parts either actually, or mentally in our Conceptions or thoughts; besides nature is one continued Body, for there is no such Vacuum in Nature, as if her Parts did hang together like a linked Chain; nor can any of her Parts subsist single and by it self, but all the Parts of Infinite Nature, although they are in one continued Piece, yet are they several and discerned from each other by their several Figures. And by this, I hope, you will understand my meaning, when I say, that several Infinites may be included or comprehended in one Infinite; for by the one Infinite, I understand Infinite in Quantity, which includes Infinite in Number, that is Infinite Parts; then Infinite in Quality, as Infinite degrees of Rarity, Density, Swiftness, Slowness, Hardness, Softness, &c. Infinite degrees of Motions, Infinite Creations, Dissolutions, Contractions, Dilations, Alterations, &c. Infinite Image 13 (page 8) degres of Wisdom, Strength, Power, &c. and lastly Infinite in Time or Duration, which is Eternity, for Infinite and Eternal are inseparable; All which Infinites are contained in the Onely Matter as many Letters are contained in one Word, many Words in one Line, many Lines in one Book. But you will say perhaps, if I attribute an Infinite Wisdom, Strength, Power, Knowledge, &c. to Nature; then Nature is in all coequal with God, for God has the same Attributes: I answer, Not at all; for I desire you to understand me rightly, when I speak of Infinite Nature, and when I speak of the Infinite Deity, sor there is great difference between them, for it is one thing a Deitical or Divine Infinite, and another a Natural Infinite; You know, that God is a Spirit, and not a bodily substance, again that Nature is a Body, and not a Spirit, and therefore none of these Infinites can obstruct or hinder each other, as being different in their kinds, for a Spirit being no Body, requires no place, Place being an attribute which onely belongs to a Body, and therefore when I call Nature Infinite, I mean an Infinite extension of Body, containing an Infinite number of Parts; but what doth an Infinite extension of Body hinder the Infiniteness of God, as an Immaterial Spiritual being? Next, when I do attribute an Infinite Power, Wisdom, Knowledge, &c. to Nature, I do not understand a Divine, but a Natural Infinite Wisdom and Power, that is, such as properly belongs to Nature, and not a supernatural, as is in god; For Nature having Infinite parts of Infinite degrees, must also have an Infinite natural wisdom to order her natural Infinite parts and actions, and consequently an Infinite natural power to put her wisdom Page 9 into act; and so of the rest of her attributes, which are all natural: But Gods Attributes being supernatural, transcend much these natural infinite attributes; for God, being the God of Nature, has not onely Natures Infinite Wisdom and Power, but besides, a Supernatural and Incomprehensible Infinite Wisdom and Power; which in no wayes do hinder each other, but may very well subsist together. Neither doth Gods Infinite Justice and his Infinite Mercy hinder each other; for Gods Attributes, though they be all several Infinites, yet they make but one Infinite. But you will say, If Nature's Wisdom and Power extends no further then to natural things, it is not Infinite, but limited and restrained. I answer, That doth not take away the Infiniteness of Nature; for there may be several kinds of Infinites, as I related before, and one may be as perfect an Infinite as the other in its kind. For example: Suppose a Line to be extended infinitely in length, you will call this Line Infinite, although it have not an Infinite breadth: Also, if an infinite length and breadth joyn together, you will call it, an Infinite Superficies, although it wants an infinite depth; and yet every Infinite, in its kinde, is a Perfect Infinite, if I may call it so: Why then shall not Nature also be said to have an Infinite Natural Wisdom and Power, although she has not a Divine Wisdom and Power? Can we say, Man hath not a free Will, because he hath not an absolute free Will, as God hath? Wherefore, a Natural Infinite, and the Infinite God, may well stand together, without any opposition or hinderance, or without any detracting or derogating from the Omnipotency and Glory of God; for God remains still the God of Image 14 (page 10) Nature, and is an Infinite Immaterial Purity, when as Nature is an Infinite Corporeal Substance; and Immaterial and Material cannot obstruct each other. And though an Infinite Corporeal cannot make an Infinite Immaterial, yet an Infinite Immaterial can make an Infinite Corporeal, by reason there is as much difference in the Power as in the Purity: And the disparity between the Natural and Divine Infinite is such, as they cannot joyn, mix, and work together, unless you do believe that Divine Actions can have allay. But you may say, Purity belongs onely to natural things, and none but natural bodies can be said purified, but God exceeds all Purity. 'Tis true: But if there were infinite degrees of Purity in Matter, Matter might at last become Immaterial, and so from an Infinite Material turn to an Infinite Immaterial, and from Natrue to be God: A great, but an impossible Change. For I do verily believe, that there can be but one Omnipotent God, and he cannot admit of addition, or diminution; and that which is Material cannot be Immaterial, and what is Immaterial cannot become Material, I mean, so, as to change their natures; for Nature is what God was pleased she should be; and will be what she was, until God be pleased to make her otherwise. Wherefore there can be no new Creation of matter, motion, or figure; nor any annihilation of any matter, motion, or figure in Nature, unless God do create a new Nature: For the changing of Matter into several particular Figures, doth not prove an annihilation of particular Figures; nor the cessation of particular Motions an annihilation of them: Neither doth the variation of the Onely Matter produce an annihilation of any Page 11 part of Matter, nor the variation of figures and motions of Matter cause an alteration in the nature of Onely Matter: Wherefore there cannot be new Lives, Souls or Bodies in Nature; for, could there be any thing new in Nature, or any thing annihilated, there would not be any stability in Nature, as a continuance of every kind and sort of Creatures, but there would be a confusion between the new and old matter, motions, and figures, as between old and new Nature; In truth, it would be like new Wine in old Vessels, by which all would break into disorder. Neither can supernatural and natural effects be mixt together, no more then material and immaterial things or beings: Therefore it is probable, God has ordained Nature to work in herself by his Leave, Will, and Free Gift. But there have been, and are still strange and erroneous Opinions, and great differences amongst Natural Philosophers, concerning the Principles of Natural things; some will have them Atoms, others will have the first Principles to be Salt, Sulphur and Mercury; some will have them to be the four Elements, as Fire, Air, Water, and Earth; and others will have but one of these Elements; also some will have Gas and Blas, Ferments, Idea's, and the like; but what they believe to be Principles and Causes of natural things, are onely Effects; for in all Probability it appears to humane sense and reason, that the cause of every particular material Creature is the onely and Infinite Matter, which has Motions and Figures inseparably united; for Matter, Motion and Figure, are but one thing, individable in its Nature. And as for Immaterial Spirits, there is surely no such thing in Infinite Nature, to wit, so as to be Parts of Nature; for Image 15 (page 12) Nature is altogether Material, but this opinion proceeds from the separation or abstraction of Motion form Matter, viz. that man thinks matter and motion to be dividable from each other, and believes motion to be a thing by its self, naming it an Imaterial thing, which has a being, but not a bodily substance: But various and different effects do not prove a different Matter or Cause, neither do they prove an unsetled Cause, onely the variety of Effects hath obscured the Cause from the several parts, which makes Particular Creatures partly Ignorant, and partly knowing. But in my opinion, Nature is material, and not any thing in Nature, what belongs to her, is immaterial; but whatsoever is Immaterial, is Supernatural, Therefore Motions, Forms, Thoughts, Ideas, Conceptions, Sympathies, Antipathies, Accidents, Qualities, as also Natural Life, and Soul, are all Material: And as for Colours, Sents, Light, Sound, Heat, Cold, and the like, those that believe them not to be substances or material things, surely their brain or heart (take what place you will for the forming of Conceptions) moves very Irregularly, and they might as well say, Our sensitive Organs are not material; for what Objects soever, that are subject to our senses, cannot in sense be denied to be Corporeal, when as those things that are not subject to our senses, can be conceived in reason to be Immaterial? But some Philosophers striving to express their wit, obstruct reason; and drawing Divinity to prove Sense and Reason, weaken Faith so, as their mixed Divine Philosophy becomes meer Poetical Fictions, and Romancical expressions, making material Bodies immaterial Spirits, and immaterial Spirits material Bodies; and some have conceived some Page 13 things neither to be Material nor Immaterial, but between both. Truly, Madam, I wish their Wits had been less, and their Judgments more, as not to jumble Natural and Supernatural things together, but to distinguish either clearly, for such Mixtures are neither Natural nor Divine; But as I said, the Confufion comes from their too nice abstractions, and from the separation of Figure and Motion from Matter, as not conceiving them individable; but if God, and his servant Nature were as Intricate and Confuse in their Works, as Men in their Understandings and Words, the Universe and Production of all Creatures would soon be without Order and Government, so as there would be a horrid and Eternal War both in Heaven, and in the World, and so pittying their troubled Brains, and wishing them the Light of Reason, that they may clearly perceive the Truth, I rest MADAM, Your real Friend and faithful Servant.   III. MADAM, IT seems you are offended at my Opinion, that Nature is Eternal without beginning, which, you say, is to make her God, or at least coeqnal with God; But, if you apprehend my meaning rightly, you will Image 16 (page 14) say, I do not: For first, God is an Immaterial and Spiritual Infinite Being, which Propriety God cannot give away to any Creature, nor make another God in Essence like to him, for Gods Attributes are not communicable to any Creature; Yet this doth not hinder, that God should not make Infinite and Eternal Matter, for that is as easie to him, as to make a Finite Creature, Infinite Matter being quite of another Nature then God is, to wit, Corporeal, when God is Incorporeal, the difference whereof I have declared in my former Letter. But as for Nature, that it cannot be Eternal without beginning, because God is the Creator and Cause of it, and that the Creator must be before the Creature, as the Cause before the Effect, so, that it is impossible for Nature to be without a beginning; if you will speak naturally, as human reason guides you, and bring an Argument concluding from the Priority of the Cause before the Effect, give me leave to tell you, that God is not tied to Natural Rules, but that he can do beyond our Understanding, and therefore he is neither bound up to time, as to be before, for if we will do this, we must not allow, that the Eternal Son of God is Coeternal with the Father, because nature requires a Father to exist before the Son, but in God is no time, but all Eternity; and if you allow, that God hath made some Creatures, as Supernatural Spirits, to live Eternally, why should he not as well have made a Creature from all Eternity? for Gods making is not our making, he needs no Priority of Time. But you may say, the Comparison of the Eternal Generation of the Son of God is Mystical and Divine, and not to be applied to natural things: I answer, The action by which God created the World or made Page 15 Nature, was it natural of supernatural? surely you will say it was a Supernatural and God-like action, why then will you apply Natural Rules to a God-like and Supernatural Action? for what Man knows, how and when God created Nature? You will say, the Scripture doth teach us that, for it is not Six thousand years, when God created this World. I answer, the holy Scripture informs us onely of the Creation of this Visible World, but not of Nature and natural Matter; for I firmly believe according to the Word of God, that this World has been Created, as is described by Moses, but what is that to natural Matter? There may have been worlds before, as many are of the opinion that there have been men before Adam, and many amongst Divines do believe, that after the destruction of this World God will Create a new World again, as a new Heaven, and a new Earth; and if this be probable, or at least may be believed without any prejudice to the holy Scripture, why may it not be probably believed that there have been other worlds before this visible World? for nothing is impossible with God; and all this doth derogate nothing from the Honour and Glory of God, but rather increases his Divine Power. But as for the Creation of this present World, it is related, that there was first a rude and indigested Heap, or Chaos, without form, void and dark; and God said, Let it be light; Let there be a Firmament in the midst of the Waters, and let the Waters under the Heaven be gathered together, and let the dry Land appear; Let the Earth bring forth Grass, the Herb yielding seed, and the Fruit-tree yielding Fruit after its own kind; and let there be Lights in the Firmament, the one to rule the Day, and Image 17 (page 16) the other the Night; and let the Waters bring forth abundantly the moving Creature that hath life; and let the Earth bring forth living Creatures after its kinde; and at last God said, Let us make Man, and all what was made, God saw it was good. Thus all was made by Gods Command, and who executed his Command but the Material servant of God, Nature? which ordered her self-moving matter into such several Figures as God commanded, and God approved of them. And thus, Madam, I verily believe the Creation of the World, and that God is the Sole and omnipotent Creator of Heaven and Earth, and of all Creatures therein; nay, although I believe Nature to have been from Eternity, yet I believe also that God is the God and Author of Nature, and has made Nature and natural Matter in a way and manner proper to his Omnipotency and Incomprehensible by us: I will pass by natural Arguments and Proofs, as not belonging to such an Omnipotent Action; as for example, how the nature of relative terms requires, that they must both exist at one point of Time, viz. a Master and his Servant, and a King and his Subjects; for one bearing relation to the other, can in no ways be considered as different from one another in formiliness or laterness of Time; but as I said, these being meerly natural things, I will nor cannot apply them to Supernatural and Divine Actions; But if you ask me, how it is possible that Nature, the Effect and Creature of God, can be Eternal without beginning? I will desire you to answer me first, how a Creature can be Eternal without end, as, for example, Supernatural Spirits are, and then I will answer you, how a Creature can be Eternal without beginning; Page 17 For Eternity consists herein, that it has neither beginning nor end; and if it be easie for God to make a Being without end, it is not difficult for Him to make a Being without beginning. One thing more I will add, which is, That if Nature has not been made by God from all Eternity, then the Title of God, as being a Creator, which is a Title and action, upon which our Faith is grounded, (for it is the first Article in our Creed) has been accessory to God, as I said, not full Six thousand years ago; but there is not anything accessory to God, he being the Perfection himself. But, Madam, all what I speak, is under the liberty of Natural Philosophy, and by the Light of Reason onely, not of Revelation; and my Reason being not infallible, I will not declare my Opinions for an infallible Truth: Neither do I think, that they are offensive either to Church or State, for I submit to the Laws of One, and believe the Doctrine of the Other, so much, that if it were for the advantage of either, I should be willing to sacrifice my Life, especially for the Church; yea, had I millions of Lives, and every Life was either to suffer torment or to live in ease, I would prefer torment for the benefit of the Church; and therefore, if I knew that my Opinions should give any offence to the Church, I should be ready every minute to alter them: And as much as I am bound in all duty to the obedience of the Church, as much am I particularly bound to your Ladiship, for your entire love and sincere affection towards me, for which I shall live and die, MADAM, Your most faithful Friend, and humble Servant.   Image 18 (page 18) IV. MADAM, I Have chosen, in the first place, the Work of that famous Philosopher Hobbs, called Leviathan, wherein I find he sayes, Part. 1. ch. 1. That the cause of sense or sensitive perception is the external body or Object, which presses the Organ proper to each Sense. To which I answer, according to the ground of my own Philosophical Opinions, That all things, and therefore outward objects as well as sensitive organs, have both Sense and Reason, yet neither the objects nor the organs are the cause of them; for Perception is but the effect of the Sensitive and rational Motions, and not the Motions of the Perception; neither doth the pressure of parts upon parts make Perception; for although Matter by the power of self-motion is as much composeable as divideable, and parts do joyn to parts, yet that doth not make perception; nay, the several parts, betwixt which the Perception is made, may be at such a distance, as not capable to press: As for example, Two men may see or hear each other at a distance, and yet there may be other bodies between them, that do not move to those perceptions, so that no pressure can be made, for all pressures are by some constraint and force; wherefore, according to my Opinion, the Sensitive and Rational free Motions, do pattern out each others object, as Figure and Voice in each others Eye and Ear; for Life and Knowledge, which I name Rational and Sensitive Matter, are in every Creature, and Page 19 in all parts of every Creature, and make all perceptions in Nature, because they are the self-moving parts of Nature, and according as those Corporeal, Rational, and Sensitive Motions move, such or such perceptions are made: But these self-moving parts being of different degrees (for the Rational matter is purer then the Sensitive) it causes a double perception in all Creatures, whereof one is made by the Rational corporeal motions, and the other by the Sensitive; and though both perceptions are in all the body, and in every part of the body of a Creature, yet the sensitive corporeal motions having their proper organs, as Work-houses, in which they work some sorts of perceptions, those perceptions are most commonly made in those organs, and are double again; for the sensitive motions work either on the inside or on the outside of those organs, on the inside in Dreams, on the out-side awake; and although both the Rational and the Sensitive matter are inseparably joyned and mixed together, yet do they not always work together, for oftentimes the Rational works without any sensitive paterns, and the sensitive again without any rational paterns. But mistake me not, Madam, for I do not absolutely confine the sensitive perception to the Organs, nor the rational to the Brain, but as they are both in the whole body, so they may work in the whole body according to their own motions. Neither do I say, that there is no other perception in the Eye but sight, in the Ear but hearing, and so forth, but the sensitive organs have other perceptions besides these; and if the sensitive and rational motions be irregular in those parts, between which the perception is made, as for example, in the two fore-mentioned men, that see and hear each other, Image 19 (page 20) then they both neither see nor hear each other perfectly; and if one's motions be perfect, but the other's irregular and erroneous, then one sees and hears better then the other; or if the Sensitive and Rational motions move more regularly and make perfecter paterns in the Eye then in the Ear, then they see better then they hear; and if more regularly and perfectly in the Ear then in the Eye, they hear better then they see: And so it may be said of each man singly, for one man may see the other better and more perfectly, then the other may see him; and this man may hear the other better and more perfectly, then the other may hear him; whereas, if perception were made by pressure, there would not be any such mistakes; besides the hard pressure of objects, in my opinion, would rather annoy and obscure, then inform. But as soon as the object is removed, the Perception of it, made by the sensitive motions in the Organs, ceaseth, by reason the sensitive Motions cease from paterning, but yet the Rational Motions do not always cease so suddenly, because the sensitive corporeal Motions work with the Inanimate Matter, and therefore cannot retain particular figures long, whereas the Rational Matter doth onely move in its own substance and parts of matter, and upon none other, as my Book of Philosophical Opinions will inform you better. And thus Perception, in my opinion, is not made by Pressure, nor by Species, nor by matter going either from the Organ to the Object, or from the Object into the Organ. By this it is also manifest, that Understanding comes not from Exterior Objects, or from the Exterior sensitive Organs; for as Exterior Objects do not make Perception, so they do neither make Page 21 Understanding, but it is the rational matter that doth it, for Understanding may be without exterior objects and sensitive organs; And this in short is the opinion of MADAM, Your faithful Friend and Servant.   V. MADAM, YOur Authours opinion is, Leviathan, Part. 1. c. 2. that when a thing lies still, unless somewhat else stir it, it will lie still for ever; but when a thing is in motion, it will eternally be in motion, unless somewhat else stay it; the reason is, saith he, because nothing can change it self; To tell you truly, Madam, I am not of his opinion, for if Matter moveth it self, as certainly it doth, then the least part of Matter, were it so small as to seem Individable, will move it self; Tis true, it could not desist from motion, as being its nature to move, and no thing can change its Nature; for God himself, who hath more power then self-moving Matter, cannot change himself from being God; but that Motion should proceed from another exterior Body, joyning with, or touching that body which it moves, is in my opinion not probable; for though Nature is all Corporeal, and her actions are Corporeal Motions, yet that doth not prove, that the Motion of particular Image 20 (page 22) Creatures or Parts is caused by the joining, touching or pressing of parts upon parts; for it is not the several parts that make motion, but motion makes them; and yet Motion is not the cause of Matter, but Matter is the cause of Motion, for Matter might subsist without Motion, but not Motion without Matter, onely there could be no perception without Motion, nor no Variety, if Matter were not self-moving; but Matter, if it were all Inanimate and void of Motion, would lie as a dull, dead and senseless heap; But that all Motion comes by joining or pressing of other parts, I deny, for if sensitive and rational perceptions, which are sensitive and rational motions, in the body, and in the mind, were made by the pressure of outward objects, pressing the sensitive organs, and so the brain or interior parts of the Body, they would cause such dents and holes therein, as to make them sore and patched in a short time; Besides, what was represented in this manner, would always remain, or at least not so soon be dissolved, and then those pressures would make a strange and horrid confusion of Figures, for not any figure would be distinct; Wherefore my opinion is, that the sensitive and rational Matter doth make or pattern out the figures of several Objects, and doth dissolve them in a moment of time; as for example, when the eye seeth the object first of a Man, then of a Horse, then of another Creature, the sensitive motions in the eye move first into the figure of the Man, then straight into the figure of the Horse, so that the Mans figure is dissolved and altered into the figure of the Horse, and so forth; but if the eye sees many figures at once, then so many several figures are made by the sensitive Corporeal Motions, Page 23 and as many by the Rational Motions, which are Sight and Memory, at once: But in sleep both the sensitive and rational Motions make the figures without patterns, that is, exterior objects, which is the cause that they are often erroneous, whereas, if it were the former Impression of the Objects, there could not possibly be imperfect Dreams or Remembrances, for fading of Figures requires as much motion, as impression, and impression and fading are very different and opposite motions; nay, if Perception was made by Impression, there could not possibly be a fading or decay of the figures printed either in the Mind or Body, whereas yet, as there is alteration of Motions in self-moving Matter, so there is also an alteration of figures made by these motions. But you will say, it doth not follow, if Perception be made by Impression, that it must needs continue and not decay; for if you touch and move a string, the motion doth not continue for ever, but ceaseth by degrees; I answer, There is great difference between Prime self-motion, and forced or Artificial Motions; for Artificial Motions are onely an Imitation of Natural Motions, and not the same, but caused by Natural Motions; for although there is no Art that is not made by Nature, yet Nature is not made by Art; Wherefore we cannot rationally judg of Perception by comparing it to the motion of a string, and its alteration to the ceasing of that motion, for Nature moveth not by force, but freely. 'Tis true, 'tis the freedom in Nature for one man to give another a box on the Ear, or to trip up his heels, or for one or more men to fight with each other; yet these actions are not like the actions of loving Imbraces and Kissing each other; neither are the  1 page duplicate	Image 21 (page 22) 1 page duplicate	Page 23 Image 22 (page 24) actions one and the same, when a man strikes himself, and when he strikes another; and so is likewise the action of impression, and the action of self-figuring not one and the same, but different; for the action of impression is forced, and the action of self-figuring is free; Wherefore the comparison of the forced motions of a string, rope, watch, or the like, can have no place here; for though the rope, made of flax or hemp, may have the perception of a Vegetable, yet not of the hand, or the like, that touched or struck it; and although the hand doth occasion the rope to move in such a manner, yet it is not the motion of the hand, by which it moveth, and when it ceases, its natural and inherent power to move is not lessened; like as a man, that hath left off carving or painting, hath no less skill then he had before, neither is that skill lost when he plays upon the Lute or Virginals, or plows, plants, and the like, but he hath onely altered his action, as from carving to painting, or from painting to playing, and so to plowing and planting, which is not through disability but choice. But you will say, it is nevertheless a cessation of such a motion. I grant it: but the ceasing of such a motion is not the ceasing of self-moving matter from all motions, neither is cessation as much as annihilation, for the motion lies in the power of the matter to repeat it, as oft it will, if it be not overpowred, for more parts, or more strength, or more motions may over-power the less; Wherefore forced, or artificial and free Natural motions are different in their effects, although they have but one Cause, which is the self-moving matter, and though Matter is but active and passive, yet there is great Variety, and so great difference in force and liberty, objects and perceptions, Page 25 sense and reason, and the like. But to conclude, perception is not made by the pressure of objects, no more then hemp is made by the Rope-maker, or metal by the Bell-founder or Ringer, and yet neither the rope nor the metal is without sense and reason, but the natural motions of the metal, and the artificial motions of the Ringer are different; wherefore a natural effect in truth cannot be produced from an artificial cause, neither can the ceasing of particular forced or artificial motions be a proof for the ceasing of general, natural, free motions, as that matter it self should cease to move; for there is no such thing as rest in Nature, but there is an alteration of motions and figures in self-moving matter, which alteration causeth variety as well in opinions, as in every thing else; Wherefore in my opinion, though sense alters, yet it doth not decay, for the rational and sensitive part of matter is as lasting as matter it self, but that which is named decay of sense, is onely the alteration of motions, and not an obscurity of motions, like as the motions of memory and forgetfulness, and the repetition of the same motions is called remembrance. And thus much of this subject for the present, to which I add no more but rest MADAM, Your faithful Friend, and Servant.   Image 23 (page 26) VI. MADAM, YOur Authour discoursing of Imagination, saith, Leviathan, part. 1. c. 2. That as soon as any object is removed from our Eyes, though the Impression that is made in us, remain, yet other objects more present succeeding and working on us, the Imagination of the past is obscured and made weak. To which I answer, first, that he conceives Sense and Imagination to be all one, for he says, Imagination is nothing else, but a fading or decaying sense; whereas in my opinion they are different, not onely their matter, but their motions also being distinct and different; for Imagination is a rational perception, and sense a sensitive perception; wherefore as much as the rational matter differs from the sensitive, as much doth Imagination differ from Sense. Next I say, that Impressions do not remain in the body of sensitive matter, but it is in its power to make or repeat the like figures; Neither is Imagination less, when the object is absent, then when present, but the figure patterned out in the sensitive organs, being altered, and remaining onely in the Rational part of matter, is not so perspicuous and clear, as when it was both in the Sense and in the Mind: And to prove that Imagination of things past doth not grow weaker by distance of time, as your Authour says, many a man in his old age, will have as perfect an Imagination of what is past in his younger years, as if he saw it present. And as for your Authours opinion, that Imagination and Memory are one and the same, I grant, that they are made Page 27 of one kind of Matter; but although the Matter is one and the same, yet several motions in the several parts make Imagination and Memory several things: As for Example, a Man may Imagine that which never came into his Senses, wherefore Imagination is not one and the same thing with Memory. But your Author seems to make all Sense, as it were, one Motion, but not all Motion Sense, whereas surely there is no Motion, but is either Sensitive or Rational; for Reason is but a pure and refined Sense, and Sense a grosser Reason. Yet all sensitive and rational Motions are not one and the same; for forced or Artificial Motions, though they proceed from sensitive matter, yet are they so different from the free and Prime Natural Motions, that they seem, as it were, quite of another nature: And this distinction neglected is the Cause, that many make Appetites and Passions, Perceptions and Objects, and the like, as one, without any or but little difference. But having discoursed of the difference of these Motions in my former Letter, I will not be tedious to you, with repeating it again, but remain, MADAM, Your faithful Friend and Servant.   Image 24 (page 28) VII. MADAM, YOur Authours opinion, concerning Dreams Leviathan, Part. 1. c. 2., seemeth to me in some part very rational and probable, in some part not; For when he sayes, that Dreams are onely Imaginations of them that sleep, which imaginations have been before either totally or by parcels in the Sense; and that the organs of Sense, as the Brain and the Nerves, being benumb'd in sleep, as not easily to be moved by external objects, those Imaginations proceed onely from the agitation of the inward parts of mans body, which for the connexion they have with the Brain, and other organs, when they be distemper'd, do keep the same in motion, whereby the Imaginations there formerly made, appear as if a man were waking; This seems to my Reason not very probable: For, first, Dreams are not absolutely Imaginations, except we do call all Motions and Actions of the Sensitive and Rational Matter, Imaginations. Neither is it necessary, that all Imaginations must have been before either totally or by parcels in the Sense; neither is there any benumbing of the organs of Sense in sleep. But Dreams, according to my opinion, are made by the Sensitive and Rational Corporeal Motions, by figuring several objects, as awake; onely the difference is, that the Sensitive motions in Dreams work by rote and on the inside of the Sensitive organs, when as awake they work according to the patterns of outward objects, and exteriously or on the outside of the Page 29 sensitive Organs, so that sleep or dreams are nothing else but an alteration of motions, from moving exteriously to move interiously, and from working after a Pattern to work by rote: I do not say that the body is without all exterior motions, when asleep, as breathing and beating of the Pulse (although these motions are rather interior then exterior,) but that onely the sensitive organs are outwardly shut, so as not to receive the patterns of outward Objects, nevertheless the sensitive Motions do not cease from moving inwardly, or on the inside of the sensitive Organs; But the rational matter doth often, as awake, so asleep or in dreams, make such figures, as the sensitive did never make either from outward objects, or of its own accord; for the sensitive hath sometimes liberty to work without Objects, but the Rational much more, which is not bound either to the patterns of Exterior objects, or of the sensitive voluntary Figures. Wherefore it is not divers distempers, as your Authour sayes, that cause different Dreams, or Cold, or Heat; neither are Dreams the reverse of our waking Imaginations, nor all the Figures in Dreams are not made with their heels up, and their heads downwards, though some are; but this error or irregularity proceeds from want of exterior Objects or Patterns, and by reason the sensitive Motions work by rote; neither are the Motions reverse, because they work inwardly asleep, and outwardly awake, for Mad-men awake see several Figures without Objects. In short, sleeping and waking is somewhat after that manner, when men are called either out of their doors, or stay within their houses; or like a Ship, where the Mariners work Image 25 (page 30) all under hatches, whereof you will find more in my Philosophical Opinions; and so taking my leave, I rest MADAM, Your faithful Friend and Servant.   VIII. MADAM, YOur Author going on in his discourse of Imagination, says, Leviathan, part. 1. c. 3. That, as we have no Imagination, whereof we have not formerly had sense, in whole or in parts; so we have not Transition from one Imagination to another, whereof we never had the like before in our senses. To which my answer is in short, that the Rational part of Matter in one composed figure, as in Man, or the like Creature, may make such figures, as the senses did never make in that composed Figure or Creature; And though your Authour reproves those that say, part. 1. c. 2. Imaginations rise of themselves; yet, if the self-moving part of Matter, which I call Rational, makes Imaginations, they must needs rise of themselves; for the Rational part of matter being free and self-moving, depends upon nothing, neither Sense nor Object, I mean, so, as not to be able to work without them. Next, when your Author, defining Vnderstanding, says that it is nothing else, but Ibid. c. 3. an Imagination raised by words or Page 31 other voluntary signs, My Answer is, that Understanding, and so Words and Signs are made by self-moving Matter, that is, Sense and Reason, and not Sense and Reason by Words and Signs; wherefore Thoughts are not like ibid. Water upon a plain Table, which is drawn and guided by the finger this or that way, for every Part of self-moving matter is not alwayes forced, perswaded or directed, for if all the Parts of Sense and Reason were ruled by force or perswasion, not any wounded Creature would fail to be healed, or any disease to be cured by outward Applications, for outward Applications to Wounds and Diseases might have more force, then any Object to the Eye: But though there is great affinity and sympathy between parts, yet there is also great difference and antipathy betwixt them, which is the cause that many objects cannot with all their endeavours work such effects upon the Interiour parts, although they are closely press'd, for Impressions of objects do not always affect those parts they press. Wherefore, I am not of your Author's opinion, that all Parts of Matter press one another; It is true, Madam, there cannot be any part single, but yet this doth not prove, that parts must needs press each other: And as for his Train of Thoughts, I must confess, that Thoughts for the most part are made orderly, but yet they do not follow each other like Geese, for surely, man has sometimes very different thoughts; as for Example, a man sometime is very sad for the death of his Friend, and thinks of his own death, and immediately thinks of a wanton Mistress, which later thought, surely, the thought of Death did not draw in; wherefore, though some thought may be the Ring-leader of others, yet Image 26 (page 32) many are made without leaders. Again, your Author in his description of the Mind sayes, that the discourse of the mind, when it it is govern'd by design, is nothing but seeking, or the Faculty of Invention; a hunting out of the Causes of some Effects, present or past; or of the Effects of some present or past Cause. Sometimes a man seeks what he has lost, and from that Place and Time wherein he misses it, his mind runs back from place to place, and time to time, to find where and when he had it, that is to say, to find some certain and limited Time and Place, in which to begin a method of Seeking. And from thence his thoughts run over the same places and times to find what action or other occasion might make him lose it. This we call Remembrance or calling to mind. Sometimes a man knows a place determinate, within the compass whereof he is to seek, and then his thoughts run over all the Parts thereof in the same manner as one would sweep a room to find a Jewel, or as a Spaniel ranges the field till he find a sent; or as a Man should run over the Alphabet to start a Rime. Thus far your Author: In which discourse I do not perceive that he defineth what the Mind is, but I say, that if, according to his opinion, nothing moves it self, but one thing moves another, then the Mind must do nothing, but move backward and forward, nay, onely forward, and if all actions were thrusting or pressing of parts, it would be like a crowd of People, and there would be but little or no motion, for the crowd would make a stoppage, like water in a glass, the mouth of the Glass being turned downwards, no water can pass out, by reason the numerous drops are so closely press'd, as they cannot move exteriously. Next, I cannot conceive how the Mind can run back Page 33 either to Time or Place, for as for Place, the mind is inclosed in the body, and the running about in the parts of the body or brain will not inform it of an Exterior place or object; besides, objects being the cause of the minds motion, it must return to its Cause, and so move until it come to the object, that moved it first, so that the mind must run out of the body to that object, which moved it to such a Thought, although that object were removed out of the World (as the phrase is:) But for the mind to move backward, to Time past, is more then it can do; Wherefore in my opinion, Remembrance, or the like, is onely a repetition of such Figures as were like to the Objects; and for Thoughts in Particular, they are several figures, made by the mind, which is the Rational Part of matter, in its own substance, either voluntarily, or by imitation, whereof you may see more in my Book of Philosophical Opinions. Hence I conclude, that Prudence is nothing else, but a comparing of Figures to Figures, and of the several actions of those Figures, as repeating former Figures, and comparing them to others of the like nature, qualities, proprieties, as also chances, fortunes, &c. Which figuring and repeating is done actually, in and by the Rational Matter, so that all the observation of the mind on outward Objects is onely an actual repetition of the mind, as moving in such or such figures and actions; and when the mind makes voluntary Figures with those repeated Figures, and compares them together, this comparing is Examination; and when several Figures agree and joyn, it is Conclusion or Judgment: likewise doth Experience proceed from repeating and comparing of several Figures in the Mind, and Image 27 (page 34) the more several Figures are repeated and compared, the greater the experience is. One thing more there is in the same Chapter, which I cannot let pass without examination; Your Authour says, That things Present onely have a being in Nature, things Past onely a being in the Memory, but things to come have no being at all; Which how it possibly can be, I am not able to conceive; for certainly, if nothing in nature is lost or annihilated, what is past, and what is to come, hath as well a being, as what is present; and, if that which is now, had its being before, why may it not also have its being hereafter? It might as well be said, that what is once forgot, cannot be remembred; for whatsoever is in Nature, has as much a being as the Mind, and there is not any action, or motion, or figure, in Nature, but may be repeated, that is, may return to its former Figure, when it is altered and dissolved; But by reason Nature delights in variety, repetitions are not so frequently made, especially of those things or creatures, which are composed by the sensitive corporeal motions in the inanimate part of Matter, because they are not so easily wrought, as the Rational matter can work upon its own parts, being more pliant in its self, then the Inanimate matter is; And this is the reason, that there are so many repetitions of one and the same Figure in the Rational matter, which is the Mind, but seldom any in the Gross and inanimate part of Matter, for Nature loves ease and freedom: But to conclude, Madam, I perceive your Author confines Sense onely to Animal-kind, and Reason onely to Man-kind: Truly, it is out of self-love, when one Creature prefers his own Excellency before another, for nature being endued with Page 35 self-love, all Creatures have self-love too, because they are all Parts of Nature; and when Parts agree or disagree, it is out of Interest and Self-love; but Man herein exceeds all the rest, as having a supernatural Soul, whose actions also are supernatural, To which I leave him, and rest, MADAM, Your faithful Friend, and Servant.   IX. MADAM, WHen your Author discourseth of the use of Speech or Words and Names, he is pleas'd to say, Leviathan, part. 1. c. 4. That their use is to serve for marks and notes of Remembrance; Whereof to give you my opinion, I say, That Speech is natural to the shape of Man; and though sometimes it serves for marks or notes of remembrance, yet it doth not always, for all other Animals have Memory without the help of Speech, and so have deaf and dumb men, nay more then those that hear and speak: Wherefore, though Words are useful to the mind, and so to the memory, yet both can be without them, whereas Words cannot be without Memory; for take a Bird and teach him to speak, if he had not Memory, before he heard the words, he could never learn them. You will ask me, Madam, What then, Image 28 (page 36) is Memory the Cause of Speech? I answer, Life and Knowledg, which is Sense and Reason, as it creates and makes all sorts of Creatures, so also amongst the rest it makes Words: And as I said before, that Memory may be without the help of Speech or Words, so I say also, that there is a possibility of reckoning of numbers, as also of magnitudes, of swiftness, of force, and other things without words, although your Author denies it: But some men are so much for Art, as they endeavour to make Art, which is onely a Drudgery-maid of Nature, the chief Mistress, and Nature her Servant, which is as much as to prefer Effects before the Cause, Nature before God, Discord before Unity and Concord. Again, your Author, in his Chapter of ReasonCh. 5., defines Reason to be nothing else but Reckoning: I answer, That in my opinion Reckoning is not Reason it self, but onely an effect or action of Reason; for Reason, as it is the chiefest and purest degree of animate matter, works variously and in divers motions, by which it produces various and divers effects, which are several Perceptions, as Conception, Imagination, Fancy, Memory, Remembrance, Understanding, Judgment, Knowledg, and all the Passions, with many more: Wherefore this Reason is not in one undivided part, nor bound to one motion, for it is in every Creature more or less, and moves in its own parts variously; and in some Creatures, as for example, in some men, it moves more variously then in others, which is the cause that some men are more dull and stupid, then others; neither doth Reason always move in one Creature regularly, which is the cause, that some men are mad or foolish: And though all men are made by the direction of Page 37 Reason, and endued with Reason, from the first time of their birth, yet all have not the like Capacities, Understandings, Imaginations, Wits, Fancies, Passions, &c. but some more, some less, and some regular, some irregular, according to the motions of Reason or Rational part of animate matter; and though some rational parts may make use of other rational Parts, as one man of another mans Conceptions, yet all these parts cannot associate together; as for example, all the Material parts of several objects, no not their species, cannot enter or touch the eye without danger of hurting or loosing it, nevertheless the eye makes use of the objects by patterning them out, and so doth the rational matter; by taking patterns from the sensitive; And thus knowledg or perception of objects, both sensitive and rational, is taken without the pressure of any other parts; for though parts joyn to parts, (for no part can be single) yet this joining doth not necessarily infer the pressure of objects upon the sensitive organs; Whereof I have already discoursed sufficiently heretofore, to which I refer you, and rest MADAM, Your faithful Friend and Servant.   Image 29 (page 38) X. MADAM, UNderstanding, says your Author, Leviathan, part. 1. c. 4. is nothing else but Conception caused by speech, and therefore, if speech be peculiar to man, (as, for ought I know, it is) then is understanding peculiar to him also. Where he confineth Understanding onely to speech and to Mankind; But, by his leave, Madam, I surely believe, that there is more understanding in Nature, then that, which is in speech, for if there were not, I cannot conceive, how all the exact forms in Generations could be produced, or how there could be such distinct degrees of several sorts and kinds of Creatures, or distinctions of times and seasons, and so many exact motions and figures in Nature: Considering all this, my reason perswadeth me, that all Understanding, which is a part of Knowledg, is not caused by speech, for all the motions of the Celestial Orbs are not made by speech, neither is the knowledg or understanding which a man hath, when sick, as to know or understand he is sick, made by speech, nor by outward objects, especially in a disease he never heard, nor saw, nor smelt, nor tasted, nor touched; Wherefore all Perception, Sensation, Memory, Imagination, Appetite, Understanding, and the like, are not made nor caused by outward objects, nor by speech. And as for names of things, they are but different postures of the figures in our mind or thoughts, made by the Rational matter; But Page 39 Reasoning is a comparing of the several figures with their several postures and actions in the Mind, which joyned with the several words, made by the sensitive motions, inform another distinct and separate part, as an other man, of their minds conceptions, understanding, opinions, and the like. Concerning Addition and Substraction, wherein your Author sayes Reasoning consists, I grant, that it is an act of Reasoning, yet it doth not make Sense or Reason, which is Life and Knowledge, but Sense and Reason which is self-motion, makes addition and substraction of several Parts of matter; for had matter not self-motion, it could not divide nor compose, nor make such varieties, without great and lingring retardments, if not confusion. Wherefore all, what is made in Nature, is made by self-moving matter, which self-moving matter doth not at all times move regularly, but often irregularly, which causes false Logick, false Arithmetick, and the like; and if there be not a certainty in these self-motions or actions of Nature, much less in Art, which is but a secundary action; and therefore, neither speech, words, nor exterior objects cause Understanding or Reason. And although many parts of the Rational and Sensitive Matter joyned into one, may be stronger by their association, and over-power other parts that are not so well knit and united, yet these are not the less pure; onely these Parts and Motions being not equal in several Creatures, make their Knowledge and Reason more or less: For, when a man hath more Rational Matter well regulated, and so more Wisdom then an other, that same man may chance to over-power the other, whose Rational Matter is more irreregular, Image 30 (page 40) but yet not so much by strength of the united Parts, as by their subtilty; for the Rational Matter moving regularly, is more strong with subtilty, then the sensitive with force; so that Wisdom is stronger then Life, being more pure, and so more active; for in my opinion, there is a degree of difference between Life and Knowledge, as my Book of Philosophical Opinions will inform you. Again, your Author sayes, That Man doth excel all other Animals in this faculty, that when he conceives any thing whatsoever, he is apt to enquire the Consequences of it, and what effects he can do with it: Besides this (sayes he) Man hath an other degree of Excellence, that he can by Words reduce the Consequences he finds to General Rules called Theoremes or Aphorisms, that is, he can reason or reckon not onely in Number, but in all other things, whereof one may be added unto, or substracted from an other. To which I answer, That according to my Reason I cannot perceive, but that all Creatures may do as much; but by reason they do it not after the same manner or way as Man, Man denies, they can do it at all; which is very hard; for what man knows, whether Fish do not Know more of the nature of Water, and ebbing and flowing, and the saltness of the Sea? or whether Birds do not know more of the nature and degrees of Air, or the cause of Tempests? or whether Worms do not know more of the nature of Earth, and how Plants are produced? or Bees of the several sorts of juices of Flowers, then Men? And whether they do not make there Aphorismes and Theoremes by their manner of Intelligence? For, though they have not the speech of Man, yet thence doth not Page 41 follow, that they have no Intelligence at all. But the Ignorance of Men concerning other Creatures is the cause of despising other Creatures, imagining themselves as petty Gods in Nature, when as Nature is not capable to make one God, much less so many as Mankind; and were it not for Mans supernatural Soul, Man would not be more Supreme, then other Creatures in Nature, But (says your Author) this Priviledge in Man is allay'd by another, which is, No living Creature is subject to absurdity, but onely Man. Certainly, Madam, I believe the contrary, to wit, that all other Creatures do as often commit mistakes and absurdities as Man, and if it were not to avoid tediousness, I could present sufficient proofs to you: Wherefore I think, not onely Man but also other Creatures may be Philosophers and subject to absurdities as aptly as Men; for Man doth, nor cannot truly know the Faculties, and Abilities or Actions of all other Creatures, no not of his own Kind as Man-Kind, for if he do measure all men by himself he will be very much mistaken, for what he conceives to be true or wise, an other may conceive to be false and foolish. But Man may have one way of Knowledge in Philosophy and other Arts; and other Creatures another way, and yet other Creatures manner or way may be as Intelligible and Instructive to each other as Man's, I mean, in those things which are Natural. Wherefore I cannot consent to what your Author says, That Children are not endued with Reason at all, till they have attained to the use of Speech; for Reason is in those Creatures which have not Speech, witness Horses, especially those which are taught in the manage, and many other Animals. And as for the Image 31 (page 42) weak understanding in Children, I have discoursed thereof in my Book of Philosophy; The rest of this discourse, lest I tyre you too much at once, I shall reserve for the next, resting in the mean time, MADAM, Your faithful Friend, and Servant.   XI. MADAM, I sent you word in my last, that your Author's opinion is, That Children are not endued with Reason at all, until they have attained to the use of Speech, in the same Chapter Ch. 4. he speaks to the same purpose thus: Reason is not as Sense and Memory born with us, nor gotten by experience onely, as Prudence is, but attained by industry. To which I reply onely this, That it might as well be said, a Child when new born hath not flesh and blood, because by taking in nourishment or food, the Child grows to have more flesh and blood; or, that a Child is not born with two legs, because he cannot go, or with two arms and hands, because he cannot help himself; or that he is not born with a tongue, because he cannot speak: For although Reason doth not move in a Child as in a Man, in Infancy as in Youth, in Youth as in Age, yet that doth not prove that Children are without Reason, because they cannot run and prate: Page 43 I grant, some other Creatures appear to have more Knowledg when new born then others; as for example, a young Foal has more knowledg than a young Child, because a Child cannot run and play; besides a Foal knows his own Dam, and can tell where to take his food, as to run and suck his Dam, when as an Infant cannot do so, nor all beasts, though most of them can, but yet this doth not prove, that a Child hath no reason at all; Neither can I perceive that man is a Monopoler of all Reason, or Animals of all Sense, but that Sense and Reason are in other Creatures as well as in Man and Animals; for example, Drugs, as Vegetables and Minerals, although they cannot slice, pound or infuse, as man can, yet they can work upon man more subtilly, wisely, and as sensibly either by purging, vomiting, spitting, or any other way, as man by mincing, pounding and infusing them, and Vegetables will as wisely nourish Men, as Men can nourish Vegetables; Also some Vegetables are as malicious and mischievous to Man, as Man is to one another, witness Hemlock, Nightshade, and many more; and a little Poppy will as soon, nay sooner cause a Man to sleep, though silently, then a Nurse a Child with singing and rocking; But because they do not act in such manner or way as Man, Man judgeth them to be without sense and reason; and because they do not prate and talk as Man, Man believes they have not so much wit as he hath; and because they cannot run and go, Man thinks they are not industrious; the like for Infants concerning Reason. But certainly, it is not local motion or speech that makes sense and reason, but sense and reason makes them; neither is sense and reason bound onely to the actions of Image 32 (page 44) Man, but it is free to the actions, forms, figures and proprieties of all Creatures; for if none but Man had reason, and none but Animals sense, the World could not be so exact, and so well in order as it is: but Nature is wiser then Man with all his Arts, for these are onely produced through the variety of Natures actions, and disputes through the superfluous varieties of Mans follies or ignorances, not knowing Natures powerful life and knowledg: But I wonder, Madam, your Author says in this place, That Reason is not born with Man, when as in another place, In his Elements of Philosophy, part. 1. c. 1. art. 1. he says, That every man brought Philosophy, that is Natural reason with him into the World; Which how it agree, I will leave to others to judg, and to him to reconcile it, remaining in the mean time, MADAM, Your Constant Friend and Faithful Servant.   XII. MADAM, TWo sorts of motions, I find your Author Leviathan, part. 1. c. 6. doth attribute to Animals, viz. Vital and Animal, the Vital motions, says he, are begun in Generation, and continued without Interruption through their whole life, aud those are the Course of the Blood, the Pulse, the Breathing, Conviction, Nutrition, Excretion, &c. to Page 45 which motions there needs no help of Imaginations; But the animal Motions, otherwise called voluntary Motions, are to go, to speak, to move any of our limbs, in such manner as is first fancied in our minds: And because going, speaking, and the like voluntary motions, depend always upon a precedent thought of whither, which way, and what, it is evident, that the Imagination is the first Internal beginning of all voluntary Motion. Thus far your Author. Whereof in short I give you my opinion, first concerning Vital Motions, that it appears improbable if not impossible to me, that Generation should be the cause and beginning of Life, because Life must of necessity be the cause of Generation, life being the Generator of all things, for without life motion could not be, and without motion not any thing could be begun, increased, perfected, or dissolved. Next, that Imagination is not necessary to Vital Motions, it is probable it may not, but yet there is required Knowledg, which I name Reason; for if there were not Knowledg in all Generations or Productions, there could not any distinct Creature be made or produced, for then all Generations would be confusedly mixt, neither would there be any distinct kinds or sorts of Creatures, nor no different Faculties, Proprieties, and the like. Thirdly, concerning Animal Motions, which your Author names Voluntary Motions, as to go, to speak, to move any of our limbs, in such manner as is first fancied in our minds, and that they depend upon a precedent thought of whither, which way, and what, and that Imagination is the first Internal beginning of them; I think, by your Authors leave, it doth imply a contradiction, to call them Voluntary Motions, and yet to say they are caused and depend upon our Image 33 (page 46) Imagination; for if the Imagination draws them this way, or that way, how can they be voluntary motions, being in a manner forced and necessitated to move according to Fancy or Imagination? But when he goes on in the same place and treats of Endeavour, Appetite, Desire, Hunger, Thirst, Aversion, Love, Hate, and the like, he derives one from the other, and treats well as a Moral Philosopher; but whether it be according to the truth or probability of Natural Philosophy, I will leave to others to judge, for in my opinion Passions and Appetites are very different, Appetites being made by the motions of the sensitive Life, and Passions, as also Imagination, Memory, &c. by the motions of the rational Life, which is the cause that Appetites belong more to the actions of the Body then the Mind: Tis true, the Sensitive and Rational self-moving matter doth so much resemble each other in their actions, as it is difficult to distinguish them. But having treated hereof at large in my other Philosophical Work, to cut off repetitions, I will refer you to that, and desire you to compare our opinions together: But certainly there is so much variety in one and the same sort of Passions, and so of Appetites, as it cannot be easily express'd. To conclude, I do not perceive that your Author tells or expresses what the cause is of such or such actions, onely he mentions their dependance, which is, as if a man should converse with a Nobleman's Friend or Servant, and not know the Lord himself. But leaving him for this time, it is sufficient to me, that I know your Ladyship, and your Ladyship knows me, that I am, MADAM, Your faithful Friend, and humble Servant.   Page 47 XIII. MADAM, HAving obey'd your Commands in giving you my opinion of the First Part of the Book of that famous and learned Author you sent me, I would go on; but seeing he treats in his following Parts of the Politicks, I was forced to stay my Pen, because of these following Reasons. First, That a Woman is not imployed in State Affairs, unless an absolute Queen. Next, That to study the Politicks, is but loss of Time, unless a man were sure to be a Favourite to an absolute Prince. Thirdly, That it is but a deceiving Profession, and requires more Craft then Wisdom. All which considered, I did not read that part of your Author: But as for his Natural Philosophy, I will send you my opinion so far as I understand it: For what belongs to Art, as to Geometry, being no Scholar, I shall not trouble my self withal. And so I'l take my leave of you, when I have in two or three words answered the Question you sent me last, which was, Whether Nature be the Art of God, Man the Art of Nature, and a Politick Government the Art of Man? To which I answer, Tis probable it may be so; onely I add this, That Nature doth not rule God, nor Man Nature, nor Politick Government Man; for the Effect cannot rule the Cause, but the Cause doth rule the Effect: Wherefore if men do not naturally agree, Art cannot make unity amongst them, or associate them into one Politick Body and so  1 page duplicate	Image 34 (page 46) 1 page duplicate	Page 47 Image 35 (page 48) rule them; But man thinks he governs, when as it is Nature that doth it, for as nature doth unite or divide parts regularly or irregularly, and moves the several minds of men and the several parts of mens bodies, so war is made or peace kept: Thus it is not the artificial form that governs men in a Politick Government, but a natural power, for though natural motion can make artificial things, yet artificial things cannot make natural power; and we might as well say, nature is governed by the art of nature, as to say man is ruled by the art and invention of men. The truth is, Man rules an artificial Government, and not the Government Man, just like as a Watch-maker rules his Watch, and not the Watch the Watch-maker. And thus I conclude and rest, MADAM, Your faithful Friend and Servant.   XIV. MADAM, COncerning the other Book of that learned Author Hobbs you sent me, called Elements of Philosophy, I shall likewise according to your desire, give you my judgment and opinion of it as I have done of the former, not that I intend to prejudice him any ways thereby, but onely to mark those places wherein Page 49 I seem to dissent from his opinions, which liberty, I hope, he will not deny me; And in order to this, I have read over the first Chapter of the mentioned Book, treating of Philosophy in General, wherein amongst the rest, discoursing of the Utility of Natural Philosophy, and relating the commodities and benefits which proceed from so many arts and sciences, he is pleased to say,Art. 7. that they are injoyed almost by all people of Europe, Asia, and some of Africa, onely the Americans, and those that live neer the Poles do want them: But why, says he, have they sharper wits then these? Have not all men one kind of soul, and the same faculties of mind? To which, give me leave, Madam, to add, That my opinion is, that there is a difference between the Divine and the Natural soul of man, and though the natural mind or soul is of one kind, yet being made of rational matter, it is divideable and composeable, by which division and composition, men may have more or less wit, or quicker and slower wit; the like for Judgments, Imaginations, Fancies, Opinions, &c. For were the natural rational mind individeable, all men would have the like degree of wit or understanding, all men would be Philosophers or fools, which by reason they are not, it proves the natural rational mind is divideable and composeable, making variations of its own several parts by self-motion; for it is not the several outward objects, or forreign instructions, that make the variety of the mind; neither is wit or ingenuity alike in all men; for some are natural Poets, Philosophers, and the like, without learning, and some are far more ingenious then others, although their breeding is obscure and mean, Neither will learning make all men Scholars, for some will continue Dunces Image 36 (page 50) all their life time; Neither doth much experience make all men wise, for some are not any ways advanced in their wisdom by much and long experiences; And as for Poetry, it is according to the common Proverb, a Poet is born, not made; Indeed learning doth rather hurt Fancy, for great Scholars are not always good Poets, nor all States-men Natural Philosophers, nor all Experienced Men Wise Men, nor all Judges Just, nor all Divines Pious, nor all Pleaders or Preachers Eloquent, nor all Moral Philosophers Vertuous; But all this is occasioned by the various Motions of the rational selfmoving matter, which is the Natural Mind. And thus much for the present of the difference of wits and faculties of the mind; I add no more, but rest, MADAM, Your faithful Friend, and Servant.   XV. MADAM, MY Discourse for the present shall be of Infinite, and the question shall be first Whether several Finite parts, how many soever there be, can make an Infinite. Your Author says, Elem. of Philos. c. 7. a. 12. that several Finite parts when they are all put together make a whole Finite; which, if his meaning be of a certain determinate number, how big soever, of finite parts, I do willingly grant, for all Page 51 what is determinate and limited, is not Infinite but Finite; neither is there any such thing, as Whole or All in Infinite; but if his meaning be, that no Infinite can be made of finite parts, though infinite in number, I deny it; Next he says there can be no such thing as One in Infinite, because No thing can be said One, except there be another to compare it withal; which in my opinion doth not follow, for there is but One God, who is Infinite, and hath none other to be compared withal, and so there may be but one Onely Infinite in Nature, which is Matter. But when he says, there cannot be an Infinite and Eternal Division, is very true, viz, in this sense, that one single part cannot be actually infinitely divided, for the Compositions hinder the Divisions in Nature, and the Divisions the Compositions, so that Nature, being Matter, cannot be composed so, as not to have parts, nor divided so, as that her parts should not be composed, but there are nevertheless infinite divided parts in Nature, and in this sense there may also be infinite divisions, as I have declared in my Book of Philosophy. P. 1. c. 8. And thus there are Infinite divisions of Infinite parts in Nature, but not Infinite actual divisions of one single part; But though Infinite is without end, yet my discourse of it shall be but short and end here, though not my affection, which shall last and continue with the life of MADAM, Your Faithful Friend and Humble Servant.

You were pleased to do for me more than ever you had made me the promise of, and much more than a man of my slender merit might reasonably expect from you, or any other. These things I have many times delightfully considered of; and since I am not Image 3 (unnumbered page) likely to render you any other compensation or return, I was willing to make you this Address, wherein I might give some publick testimony how sensibly I find my self affected with the memory of your manifold kindness towards me: a great addition to which will be the acceptance of this mean Present which I here lay at your Feet; and then cease to give you a further trouble from Coventrey: Iune 17, 1677. Honourable Sir,  Your most Obliged Humble Servant NATH. WANLEY.   Unnumbered page THE PREFACE TO THE READER. THE first thoughts I had about the Entrance upon such a Design as the History of Man, were occasioned by some passages I met with in my Lord Verulam's Book of the Advancement of Learning;Lib. 4. c. 1. p. 179, 180.181. where I found him saying, That Touching the matter of Man's Prerogatives, it is a Point that may well be set down amongst Deficients. He adds, I suppose it would much conduce to the Magnanimity and Honour of Man, if a Collection were made of the Vltimities (as the Schools speak) or Summities (as Pindar) of Humane Nature, principally out of the faithful Reports of History; that is, what is the last and highest pitch, to which Man's Nature, of it self, hath ever reached, in all the Perfections both of Body and Mind. It is evident (goes he on) what we mean; namely, that the Wonders of Humane Nature, and Virtues as well of Mind as of Body, should be collected into a Volume, which might serve as a Calender of Humane Triumphs. For a Work of this nature, we approve the Purpose and Design of Valerius Maximus and C. Plinius; but it could be wished they had used more choice and diligence. When I had read thus far, I considered what had been done already in this matter by the two forenamed Writers; and in the issue, was well satisfied that they had not performed so much herein, but that there was yet Field-room enough left for any such as had the leisure and inclination to exercise themselves further upon this Subject. As for my self, I was sufficiently sensible that I lay under too many Discouragements to adventure upon a Work of this nature. For whereas it requires variety of Books, great Judgment, vast Reading, and a full Freedom and Leisure to attend upon it: In respect of all these, I knew my own Poverty; and thereupon that I had no reason to intermeddle in an Affair, wherein I could expect to meet with little or no success. But whereas my first intentions were to make some such little Collections and References in this kind, as might some way be serviceable to my self only; I know not how by degrees I found I had enlarged far beyond my own purposes; and then was perswaded by some such persons as I have reason to esteem, that this Collection, such as it now is, might not be unuseful nor unacceptable to some sorts of Men, in case I should make it publick, as I have now done. I must confess, that in the whole of this Book there is little of my own, Image 4 (unnumbered page) besides the Method, and way of its Composure; and therefore if some of these Examples which I have set down may seem utterly incredible, or at best but improbable, let it be remembred that I am not the Inventor, but Reciter; not the Framer, but only the Collector of them; wherein too, I have usually laid the Child at the Father's own Door; or however, have cited those Authors from whence I received the report and the intelligence thereof. I impose nothing upon any Man's belief, but leave every Reader at his full liberty for the degree of his Faith in these matters. And if I have cited more than one or two Writers for this or that Example, it is not of mere vanity, but for some such reasons as these; sometimes I have ""ssisted my self with some Circumstances from one"

Thibaut ... ; and now translated into English by a fellow of the Royal Society.,1675-01-01,,"""Image 1 (unnumbered page) THE ART OF Chymistry: As it is now Practised. Written in French, By P. THIBA�T, Chymist to the French King. And now Translated into English, BY A Fellow of the Royal Society. LONDON: Printed for John Starkey, at the Miter near Temple-Bar in Fleetstreet. 1675.   Image 2 (unnumbered page) Licensed, Roger L'Estrange. Unnumbered page 1 page duplicate	 Image 3 (unnumbered page)   Unnumbered page The Author's PREFACE. I Have, Courteous Reader, but two things to say to thee; the first is, To deliver my Opinion concerning Chymistry; and the other is, To set down my Way and Method of proceeding in Operations. Chymistry, as I take it, is a Liberal Art, which, though it have the same Object, and the same End, as Vulgar Pharmacy, does nevertheless compose it by Nobler, and more Ingenious Image 4 (unnumbered page) Means, and more to the advantage of Physick. In ancient times, even long before Hippocrates, Physitians neither knew, nor made use of any more than four ways of preparing their Remedies; for, either they pressed the Juice out of their Ingredients, or beat them to powder, or they boiled them, or else they infused them in Water, or some other Liquor, and so gave them to their Patients. Some Ages after, and particularly since Mesue, and those other famous Arabians, till the time of Paracelsus, Physitians continually invented so many new Preparations, and put so many Disguises upon their Remedies, that they were fain to give over doing of it themselves, and to assign that care to those whom we now call Apothecaries. But, if we give a Judicious Unnumbered page Curiosity leave to pry into these manifold Disguises, we shall soon be convinced, that they are indeed nothing but the four first Simple Preparations, with the addition of Sugar or Honey, and some differences of Colour and Consistency; for the most part heaping great quantities of Simples one upon another, to the end their Patients might swallow them with less distaste. Paracelsus and his Followers having particularly wrought upon Minerals, found out some excellent Remedies; and being encouraged by their rich Discoveries, they continued them with such eagerness, that in a short time with Inventions equally ingenious and laborious, they did almost subdue the three Kingdoms of Vegetables, Animals and Minerals, and came to the possession of most rich, Image 5 (unnumbered page) and hitherto unknown Secrets, insomuch, as one may say, that even from the beginning of the World, to their times, the Vertues of those excellent Remedies lay buried in their own Bodies, as in a Grave. This may be clearly seen in Crude Antimony, of which a pound, either in powder, or in Infusion, or Decoction, works no other effect in the Body, than if we had swallowed as much Saw-dust. But, if you know how to open its Body by the Keys of Chymistry, then for interiour Remedies, you shall have an Emetick, a Purgative, a Sudorifick, a Diaphoretick, a Diuretick, and a Cordial, which you need only give in a different proportion of so many Grains. And for exteriour Applications, you may, out of the same Antimony, have a Desiccative, a Mundificative, a Consumptive, Unnumbered page or Escarotick, with other rare Remedies, as we shall hereafter set down at large. If we consider Mercury, they that work in the Mines in Spain, teach us by their Theft, that more than a pound of it may be taken inwards without harm; for, a little before they give over working, they swallow a good quantity of it, which, when they are at liberty, they ease themselves of by Stool, and so keep it to sell in secret. And this the Overseers having discovered, do now force every Workman to stay there a considerable time, after his giving over working, that these Mercurial Thieves may be so forced to leave their theft behind them. But, if by the vertue of Chymical Dissolvants you open the body of Quicksilver, it will produce in very small Doses, such various and wonderful Image 6 (unnumbered page) effects, that out of it alone may be had Remedies to answer all the Indications of Physick. Is there any thing more contemptible than Niter, in the hands of the Vulgar Pharmacy? But, is there any thing more admirable than the self-same Niter handled by Chymistry? for with it, we make now a pleasant and cooling Acid, now a hot and burning Corrosive; sometimes it revives the Emetick and Purgative vertue of Antimony, sometimes it kills the Emetick, and revives only the Purgative, and sometimes it destroys both Emetick and Purgative, and quickens either the Diuretick or Diaphoretick; and in a word, it produces so many wonderful effects upon all the other Minerals, that we may justly call it the �niversal Agent of Chymistry. Who would think that a quantity of Silver, Unnumbered page no bigger than a Pea, Chymically prepared, were able to heal, by once touching, any Ulcers of the Mouth? and by two or three touchings, soften and heal the hardest, and most inveterate Ulcers, and even the Gangrene it self in any part of the Body, and that incomparably better than any Remedy of the Old Pharmacy. Would any body believe, that out of Common Salt, which is generally reputed so prejudicial to those that are subject to the Stone or Gravel, Chymists should extract a pleasant Spirit, which drives out all Gravel, breaks the Stone in the Kidneys and Bladder, and dissolves entirely in the palm of the hand a Stone cut out of a humane Bladder? I should be tedious in setting out all the other VVonders of this Art, only this I'll say to prove its excellency, Image 7 (unnumbered page) That whereas in its birth, and even in its growth, when it was either not known at all, or ill known by Physitians, almost every body had an aversion, and a prejudice against it; now quite contrary, being highly esteemed, and throughly known by the Learned and Experienced Professors of this Art, it has gained the Reputation of being the best Instrument of the excellent Cures they perform. But, if in requital of the kind Reception it now meets withal in the world, Chymistry hath any acknowledgments to pay, it is particularly to Monsieur Vallot, who having been long the Physitian of the greatest Practice in Paris, is now the Physitian of his Most Christian Majesty; in which place, by his profound Learning, and the excellent choice Unnumbered page of Remedies, borrowed, for the most part, from Chymistry, he still performs wonderful, and most singular Cures. So famous an Example makes me apt to believe, that if there be any persons obstinate in their old errour against Chymistry, they will by little and little forsake it; as those have been forced to do, who for a long time stubbornly opposed the new Discovery of the Vessels that carry the Chyle from the Stomach to the Heart, without coming at the Liver, only because they had not seen, or at least not well observed this new conveyance. Now for my Method, it all runs upon two principles; First, To find out, and set down solid and pertinent Reasons of all the Circumstances which accompany our Operations. The Second, to discover the best, easiest, Image 8 (unnumbered page) and shortest way of performing the said Operations. These were no easie things to be found out; for, the first Chymists happened upon abundance of excellent Secrets, but being ignorant of the true Reasons of their Discovery; that they might give credit to their new Science, they made use of the Cabalistique Cloak, of covering all things with a Mystery. The Modern Professors indeed have given a better Foundation to their Art, and so good an one, as hath shaken that of the old Philosophy, but withal, either for want of skill, or maliciously they have encumbred their processes with so many, and such impertinent Circumstances, lengthening both them and the expences, that very few, and indeed none, but very sharp-sighted Physitians have been able to see Unnumbered page through the Cloud, and both receive and communicate the benefit of the light there hidden. This consideration has moved me in this my VVork, to keep within the limits of Chymistry, neglecting any Speculations beside my purpose; and withal, to endeavour to free my processes from all those Obscurities, Difficulties and Protractions, which Experience and Reason have convinced me to be either superfluous, or prejudicial to them. If I have not executed my design to thy mind, I must confess, Courteous Reader, that it is much a harder thing to perform well, than to project.

THE Chymical Laboratory is a place fit to perform the Operations of Chymistry, which cannot be done without great preparations, experience, industry and skill. The Chymical Laboratory, requires of it self three Conditions: First, there must be a Chimney in it for those Processes, where some unpleasant and noisom smoaks are to be avoided: Secondly, The Room ought to be clear and light, that one may see distinctly, even to the bottom of the Vessels, the divers changes Image 18 (page 2) that do happen, and which sometimes, in some choice and important Operations, ought to be observed with a great deal of care, that one may either augment or diminish the heat, as necessity shall require. Thirdly, The place ought to be so capacious, as that in one part may be the Furnaces, in another the Vessels and Utensils, and in another your Auditors or Spectators; and yet in the middle there may be room enough left for the Artist to mind his Operations, and bestir himself.   Of the Chymical Instruments. THe Chymical Instruments, with which a Laboratory ought to be furnished, are of two sorts: for some are Principal, the others less-Principal. The Principal Instruments without which no Operation can be done, are, the Lute, the Furnaces, the Vessels, and the Fire. The less-Principal are those that serve sometimes for one Process, sometimes for another, towards the facilitating of them; and are in great number. But I propose only Thirty of the most useful: viz. an Iron Ladle, a little Iron Bar, an Iron Spatula, a great Stick, a Brass Mortar and Pestle, a Marble Mortar, with a Woodden-pestle; a Plate-dish of White-ware, with a Glass-pestle, two pair of Scales and Weights; a Marble or Porphyry-stone to grind Page 3 upon; some Pack-thread, white and brown Paper, Starch or Glue, a fine Sieve; some old Linenrags cut out into long slices, some Ashes, some Sand, some Tiles, some water, a Tin-Mould in form of a Pipe, an Iron-Mould for Pistol-Bullets, a Copper-Mould for a Goblet, a little Trevet, a Woodden Spoon, a Tin-Tunnel, Rolls stuft with Straw or Chaff, or made of Paste-board, a Mould for Bricks, a Fire-Shovel, a pair of Tongs, and a pair of Bellows. Of these we shall not treat here particularly, but as occasion shall serve in the Operations where they shall be imployed.   Of the Chymical Lute. TO make a good Lute for all the purposes of Chymistry, take of Potters-Earth, of white or yellow Sand, and of Horse-dung, an equal quantity, not an equal weight; mingle them, and moisten them by little and little with water, first working them together with your feet upon the ground, then piece by piece kneading of them exactly with your hands upon a Table, till you have so incorporated your Ingredients, that they are not distinguishable from one another; then make them up in form of Bricks, that so you may use them more neatly; keeping them from Fire and Sun, lest they should be over-dry and hard. The Potters Earth is made use of because of its unctuosity, which makes the Lute less brittle; the Sand is employed to bind the Potters Image 19 (page 4) Earth from cracking, and flying, and burning to dust. (And some do use powder'd Glass for the same end.) The Horse-dung is added, because being full of little Straws well grownd by the Horses Teeth, they do serve for the firmer knitting of the matter together. (And so some use Calves Hair for that purpose.) Finally, the Water incorporates these three things together; In the place of which, some use the Whites of Eggs, which by their sliminess make a stronger conglutination of all the Ingredients. This Lute serves for six uses: 1. To make Bricks. 2. To lute and cement the Bricks of your Furnaces. 3. To fill up the cracks and slits of your Furnaces. 4. To frame little Rounds like Salt-sellers to set the Retorts on. 5. To lute all Vessels both of Earth and Glass. 6. To repair the cracks of your Vessels. Now because there is a peculiar industry in well forming the Bricks and Salt-sellers, or Rounds, and in luting the Vessels; I shall here set it down at length. Our Bricks are all of a bigness and proportion, that so our Furnaces may be the more even and firm, and the easilier built, even without cement: Moreover, they are almost in the shape of a half Moon, that they may make the Furnace round; that figure being the fittest to gather and concentrate the heat. Therefore we form our Bricks in a Woodden-mould either of Box or Guaiac, or some such hard wood. The piece of wood is a foot long, half a foot broad, and three inches thick. In its middle there must be a hollow or overture drawn from a Round made with Page 5 a Compass; which Overture ought to be eight inches outwards, six inches inwards; three inches large, and three inches thick. Now to make your Bricks, fill your mould with lute, and with a woodden knife even the superficies, and so knock out your Brick; and when your mould grows dirty, rub the sides of it with sand; dry your Bricks in the shade, so they will last longer; for being thus half-dried, they will bake leasurely in the using of them, and not be apt to crumble and break, neither will they be so soon calcin'd, as if you had dried them by the fire or Sun, or in a Potters Oven. Our Rounds or Salt-sellers derive their name from their figure, because they are somewhat like the old-fashioned Salt-sellers. To form them, take of our Lute a quantity as big as your fist, and rowling it between both hands, reduce it to the form of a Cylinder two inches high; flat the lower end of it upon a Table, and then with your fingers sink in the upper part, till it be somewhat like a Salt-seller that is hollow, and of the breadth of an inch in diameter. For the luting of your Vessels, the Lute that is employed ought to be softer than either for Bricks or Rounds, and therefore you'll do well to wet it with some Water. It must not be laid on thicker than the thickness of a Half-Crown-piece; for if it be, the fire will scarce be able to heat the Water contained in your Vessels. Observe that sometimes the Matrasses are luted up to the neck, sometimes half way. Retorts are luted in the same way too; only there Image 20 (page 6) ought to be a little space left near the neck, that one may see thorow it into the Vessel in the time of the Operation: Your Vessel being luted, must be dried at leisure in the Sun or shade, or near a gentle fire; taking care to turn them equally, so that they be not dried more in one place than in another.   Of the Chymical Furnaces. OUr Furnaces are round and little: They are round, that they may unite and concentrate the heat of the fire; they are little, that our Laboratory may not be incumber'd to no purpose, and also that we may give our Vessels a quicker and more equal fire, and that with less toil and less expence. We have two sorts of Furnaces: the first are fixt, which are made of different lays of crooked Bricks, cemented strongly together with our Lute; the others are moveable, and consist of crooked Bricks laid one upon another without any lute or cement, and in which you lay the fire, not under your Vessels as in the first sort of Furnaces, but circularly round about them. The fixt and cemented Furnaces are five in number; to wit, the Furnace with a heat of Bulneum maris, or of the vaporous Bath; the Furnace with the heat of ashes or sand; the Furnace with a naked fire and circular heat; the Furnace Page 7 with a naked fire and small Reverberation; and the Furnace with the fire of great Reverberation. The moveable and not cemented Furnaces are likewise five in number; viz. the Furnace with a small circulatory fire; the Furnace with a great circulatory fire; the Furnace with a fire of circulation and suppression without a gape; the Furnace with a fire of circulation and suppression with a gape; and the Furnace with a moulting fire, or the wind furnace: All these five Furnaces are with a naked fire. The Furnace with the heat of Balneum maris, or the vaporous Bath, is necessary for the gentle distilling of all sorts of aery or sulphureous liquors in glass-bodies, placed in a Cauldron full of water; and withal, it serves to evaporate and dry, by its gentle heating vapour, all extracts, and salts, in little earthen glaz'd dishes, which are set upon the Overtures made in the cover of the said Kettle or Cauldron; so that the remedies thus dryed have no odour not taste of Empyreume or burning. For the building of this Furnace, do thus: lay one Round of our Bricks of such a compass as may be proportionate to the greatness of the Kettle you intend for your Balneum, leaving an empty place before, four or five inches broad for the ashes-hole; then lay another entire Round of Bricks, upon which place your Grate; then upon this lay two Rounds more, leaving before an empty space for your fire-door, as you did for your ash-hole; and then add four entire Rounds for your Laboratory, leaving in the upper most of Image 21 (page 8) them three little jams or gaps, each an inch wide to let in the air; viz. one before, above the fire-door; another behind, over against to this first; and a third on the side, which shall be opposite to that where the Receiver is placed, lest if there were one on that side, the flame might sometimes break the Nose of the Limbeck. Now for your Kettle or Cauldron, it must have a brim of an inch broad, whereby it may be scituated and equally suspended upon the brims of your Furnace, leaving betwixt it and the Furnace-sides an orbicular space of an inch, to give the fire play round about it, that so it may heat equally the matter contained within it. In the Fabrick of this Furnace, as likewise in the structure of the four following, observe: 1. That you must not forget to put a sufficient quantity of Lute under, above, and betwixt your Bricks, that they may be strongly cemented together. 2. That you must not place your Bricks just one upon another; if so, your Furnace will not be firm and stable, but by the operation of the fire will soon cleave asunder. Do therefore as expert Brick-layers, and interlace your Bricks one with another. The Furnace with the fire, or heat, or sand, or ashes, is useful for the distillation, and rectification of all sorts of liquors drawn from Vegetals, Animals, or Minerals, in glass or earthen bodies, glazed with their glass heads, and also for all infusions, extinctions, tinctures, evaporations, &c. made in Cucurbits, Matrasses, Page 9 dishes, pans of glass, or glazed earthen ware. This is the hardest to be well built of all our Furnaces, and, for the building of it, do thus; first make a sufficient quantity of Mortar, consisting of our Lute, Water, and Plaster of Paris in powder; then with little Tiles make upon a floor, an Oval of one foot in length, and of eight inches in breadth; cement your Tiles well together with this Mortar, which because of the Plaster will render your Furnace more firm and durable; raise this first Oval Lay of Tiles to the heighth of two inches, leaving a space for your ash-hole; then add one Lay of our Bricks, not filling up the space left for the ash-hole, because it must be almost as high as the space to be left for the fire-room; upon this lay of Bricks, place your Iron-bars for a Grate in the same distance, as they are set in chafing-dishes, placing one little bar upon the ash-hole door, not forgetting to bestow good store of Mortar both above, under, and betwixt your Bricks and Bars: then upon so much of this Furnace as is already built, place small Tiles, cementing of them together in such an order, as may make this Furnace acquire a square figure outwardly, which will make it more solid and firm; and by adding to it a considerable thickness, fit it for the conserving of an equal heat with a few Coals. Upon this first lay of Bricks, (which have in the inside an oval figure though the Tiles hanging over on the outside form a square one) place another Lay of Bricks, leaving a convenient space for the fire-room, which must be something higher than it is broad: but observe Image 22 (page 10) that in this Oval lay must be employed more Bricks than in the other, because your Furnace by little and little must acquire a greater circumference towards the top; then build up with little Tiles and Mortar, your square outside to the heighth of your Bricks, so continuing as you build up your Furnace: upon the top of the fire-room lay a little Iron bar, then add another entire round of Bricks without any overture, only a little chinck in the backside of your Furnace over against the fire-room, of two fingers breadth to give the fire air; and this Circle must be in circumference wider by two inches than the last; smoothing with mortar the inside of this round; that the fire may be carried more evenly upwards: this done, place on this last Round a square Iron plate all of a piece; (or of two pieces if you will, sawdering them well one upon another) the place must not be thicker than a shilling, that so the fire may the easilier penetrate and give a moderate heat to the sand; then with our Mortar raise on the inside a Square of an inch thick, to all the four sides of the Furnace, to make a place to put your sand in, or ashes if you will: ashes give not so great a heat as sand: whensoever you desire to moderate the heat of either, you may wet them with a little water. The Furnace with a naked fire and circular heat, serves to distil Aqua vitae, spirit of Wine, Aromatick and Balsamick ossences, and also the waters of all Plants: in the Brass-vessel, called Vesica, with its Helm or Moors head, borded Page 11 with a refrigeratory of the same metal, making use also of a long pipe of the same matter which passes through one or two great Hogs-heads full of water near the Furnace; and which are in stead of a second and more powerful refrigeratory. For the building of this Furnace, do thus. First, take your Brass Vesica, set it upon the ground where you intend to erect your Furnace, then lay a Round of Bricks well cemented with our Lute, so that there be half a fingers breadth left betwixt your Vesica and the Bricks, and an Overture for the ash-hole; then taking out your Vesica, add another Round of Bricks, leaving still room for the ash-hole; which will be about half a foot high: upon these two lays place a Grate of divers little Iron-Bars; then add an entire Round of Bricks, to which add two more but not entire, leaving a space empty for the fire-room perpendicularly over the ash-hole; then add one circle of Bricks entire, without any Overture, upon which place two little Iron-Bars to uphold the bottom of your Vesica. And in this place is terminated the heighth of your fire-room, which is once again as high as your ash-hole. After this raise by Rounds your Furnace, till you have brought it as high as the neck of the Vesica; which that you may the better do, place your Vesica upon its two Bars, and so it will serve for a measure, to the elevation your Furnace ought to have. Observe, that this Furnace is not to have any chink on any side whatsoever; but every where, and particularly in the Laboratory, there ought Image 23 (page 12) to be circularly half a fingers breadth left empty, that so the air compassing the Vessel, may draw the heat upwards in all the circumference of the Vesica. And this environing heat carries the Spirits from the bottom of the Vessel to its neck, from whence they are raised all together to the top of the cover or Moors head; and if above you stop this empty circumference, your fire will be apt to go out, if it be not excessive great, which also would be inconvenient, because it would consume in vain great quantity of fewel. The Furnace with a naked fire and small reverberatory serves to distil the Phlegm, the Spirit, and the foetide Oyl of Berries, Woods, Barks, and Roots, in an earthen, or glass Retort well luted, lest it should break in the fire. For the building of this Furnace, you must first consider of the bigness of the Retorts, you ordinarily intend to make use of; and make the circuit of your Furnace so wide, as there may be a fingers breadth left betwixt it and your Retort. Lay then four or five Rounds of Bricks in the said proportion, leaving an empty space for your ash-hole and fire-room; they being not to be separated in this Furnace by a Grate, because else the air coming in at the ash-hole, and meeting with the fire upon a Grate, would kindle it too violently, and so great a fire is not requisite for these substances to be distilled. Then add an entire Round of Bricks, upon which place two Iron bars, upon which you must put the cover of a Pipkin turned with its hollow part upwards, which must be filled with sand to receive the bottom of the Retort: Page 13 then with divers Rounds of Brick raise your Furnace to the heighth of the Retort, or higher; taking care to leave an overture, or open space, to pass the neck of the Retort; which chink you must afterwards with our Lute repair under the neck of your Retort, to hinder the flame from passing that way, and endangering the breaking of the Vessels. Having fitted a Recipient to it, you must lute both their necks together, very close, to the end that nothing of the spirits exhale and scape that way in the distillation. Last of all, you must have an earthen Pan of the capacity of your Furnace, which may cover the top of it, and reverberate the rising flame upon the Retort; and this Pan must be of glazed earth, else it would fly in pieces in the heat: besides, it must have a hole in the middle of its bottom, of the bigness of an Egg, and this to give the fire air, which else would be stifled, and go out. The Furnace with a naked fire, and great Reverberatory, serves to distil the acid and corrosive spirits; the acid, black and corrosive Oyls in a glass, or earthen luted Retort, or in an iron one. To build this Furnace, you must consider of the bigness of the Retorts you mean to employ, and do as above in the little Reverberatory-Furnace: then make an ash-hole covered with a Grate, and a fire-room covered with its two Iron bars; and at last, a Laboratory of the elevation of the belly of your Retort, as has been said already; only you must on the top of the Laboratory leave a chink on one side of the ash-hole, and fire-room, of two Bricks in heighth, to pass the neck of the Retort. Image 24 (page 14) Before you place your Retort upon the Iron-Bars, you must provide a little earthen cover with ashes, as has been said in the first Furnace of this kind. Then place your Retort, and fit to it a large Recipient, which must be also setled with great care upon a little Joint-stool, and under it must be either Paper, or Linen, or some soft thing, that it may rest gently and surely upon. Then with our Lute, fill up the space you left for the neck of the Retort, for the reason alledged in the precedent Furnace, luting also the conjunction of the Retort and its Receiver together: this being done, there remains to make a Reverberatory, which may reflect, and beat back the rising heat, upon the Retort: and to this effect, lay five Rounds of moveable Bricks, that is, without Mortar, or Lute; only one upon another, in such a manner as your Rounds go always in diminishing; so that in the first you employ half a Brick less than in the last cemented Round; and in the second, a whole Brick less than in the first moveable Round; and in the third you must employ two Bricks less than in the second, leaving a hole in this last Round, which you shall fill up with pieces of Iron, of such a bigness as shall not slip betwixt the space that is left between the Retort, and the Wall of the Furnace: The reason why I put Iron, rather than Bricks or Stone, or any other solid thing, is, because at the end of the Operation you'll find an excellent Crocus astringens of Mars, red as Scarlet, and which will stick to the superficies of all your pieces of Iron. Page 15  The Furnace, with a little circulatory fire, or Ignis rotae parvus, serves to evaporate the dissolutions of Minerals, as also of Animals and Vegetals, by a gentle ready heat in a Matrass, either luted, or not luted. This Furnace is made of one only Round of our Bricks, close set together without any Lute or Mortar: you must place a Round or Salt-seller of Lute in the middle of this Furnace; and upon this Salt-seller, filled with sand or ashes, place your Matrass straight, leaving a circumference of two inches between your Matrass, and the Furnace sides; then put your Coal, ready kindled, into this space, approaching your fire nearer to the Furnace than to the Matrass. The Furnace, with a great circulatory fire, serves to sublime all salts drawn from Metals and Minerals in a luted glass Matrass. This Furnace is made of two equal Rounds of our Bricks, so set together without Lute, that there is a little distance betwixt them, to the end that the Air, entering at these small Overtures, may serve to keep the fire alive: place your Salt-seller, and upon it your Matrass, then your Coals, as we have said in the precedent Furnace. The Furnace, with a circulary fire, and of suppression without any chink; is useful to calcine, and melt down all sorts of Minerals, as also those Animals and Vegetables that require Calcination, either in a Crucible, or a Pot of Earth unglazed: To build this Furnace, lay first upon the ground either a large Salt-seller of our Lute, or two Bricks, and upon them your Image 25 (page 16) Crucible or Pot; then raise divers Rounds of our Bricks without Lute, till they come two or three fingers above your Pot, leaving in the first rank an interval of a fingers breadth betwixt the Bricks, but in the last row they must be joined very close together: leave also betwixt your Crucible, and the Furnace-sides, a space of two inches broad, which must be filled with Coals up to the top of the Furnace: and from thence this fire is called a fire of Suppression, because the Coals are not only under, but circularly above, and on the sides of the Vessel; and besides, very often we cover the whole Pot with Coals. The Furnace, with a fire of Suppression, with a chink, is for the distillation of Oyls, and Spirits, and Phlegms of all sorts of resinous Gums, and Wax, in a Glass Retort well luted; it is made as the precedent, only there ought to be in the two last Rounds of Bricks, a chink, gap, or overture for the neck of your Retort to pass through, which must be set, and compassed with Coals, as has been said. Observe, That in placing your Retort, either in this Furnace, or any of the small or great Reverberatories, there are three things to be taken notice of. 1. That the body of the Retort touch the Bricks of the side, that the Chink is in such a manner as the whole neck may hang out at the Chink, lest otherwise the fire should break it. 2. That the neck of your Retort hang downwards, that the liquor may the easilier run into the Recipient. 3. That the end of the neck of your Retort enter into the middle of your Recipient, Page 17 for fear the vapours received should find some passage, even through their luted conjunction. The Furnace, with a melting-fire, or the Wind-Furnace, to melt the hardest bodies; as Gold, Glass, Stones, in a Crucible, or unglazed Earthen pot: and it is thus made. Take two Loggs of Wood, or two great Stones, half a foot high; a Barrel knock'd out at the lower end, and having in the other a hole as big as a mans head, then set this Barrel upon the Stones or Loggs, and having laid a Grate upon the uppermost hole, cover all this top with our Lute, and Plaster together; and upon this erect a moveable Furnace, with the fire of suppression, with our Bricks, as it has been said before. The air coming in, with violence under the Barrel, does so blow and light the Coals, that it produces a heat incomparably greater than any other.   Of the Chymical Vessels. THe Kettle, or Cauldron, serving for the Balneum Maris, or Vaporous Bath. This Kettle is of the same matter and form as ordinary Kettles are, that is, Brass: it must have no Bail, but round about it a brim of an inch broad, by which it is to be suspended, upon the brim of the Furnace; this Kettles cover must exactly fit it, and have five round holes; whereof the middlemost Image 26 (page 18) must be the biggest, and capable of the bottom of a Glass-Cucurbit, or Body, with its head: the four other are less, and for little dishes of Earth, or Glass, in which Extracts, and Salts are to be dried. The Vesica, or Copper-body, cover'd with its Moors-head, and bordered with its Refrigeratory, serving to distil Aqua vitae, Aromatick and Balsamick Essences, Waters, and Spirits of Plants. This Vesica ought to be of Copper; not tinn'd within, and somewhat round bottom'd: it ought not to be thicker than a shilling, of one foot and a half high, and one foot broad in diameter: in its top it must be a little Convex, not in form of a Pear, as they ordinarily make them; and this, that it may repercute the phlegm of Aqua vitae, and the Essences. From the middle of this top, rises a neck four inches high, and three in diameter below, but four inches above; whose use is, to make the Cover of the Vesica enter easily, and stick faster, and so you see that this Vessel is not unlike a Hogs-bladder; on one side of the top, rises a little pipe two inches high, and half a finger wide, by which, with a Tin-tunnel you put in again the first Spirits of Wine that come a little muddy, because they have carried along with them the smoot adhering to the conducts of the Alembick: its Cover is of Brass, and consists of a neck half a foot deep, three inches large at the top and bottom, but four inches in the middle, because within it must be five or six Spunges, so fastned with cross-sticks under and Page 19 over them, as to be kept from falling down into the Vesica, and from rising up into the head: their use is, to draw to themselves the aetherial Spirit of the Aqua vitae, or Brandy, and to hinder the phlegm (which in the middle of the Operation rises with the Spirits) from passing any farther: for, the Spirit being thin and aery, easily makes way, where the gross phlegm cannot; which therefore falls down again into the Vesica: This neck is terminated in a round Ball, not unlike a humane skull, and is therefore called the Moors-head, from whose middle is derived a Pipe a foot long, and in diameter an inch wide, which goes through a Cauldron or Kettle, sawder'd round about the Moors-head, and which must be of such a proportion, as to contain a pale of water, which is poured in the Operation, cold, to the end that the Vapours that are in the Moors-head may be soon condensed, and dissolved into liquor. This Cauldron is therefore called a Refrigeratory: on one side of the brim there is a little cock, wherewith to empty the water if it grow too hot, and when the Operation is ended. The little moveable neck, by which the Pipe coming from the Moors-head, must be join'd with the long Pipe that goeth through the Hogs-heads, ought to be half a foot long: the long Pipe which passes through the Hogs-heads, must be of Brass, and six foot long, one inch wide in diameter; by little and little diminishing, as it comes nearer the end: This Pipe goes through two Hogs-heads, situated close by one another, by four holes, so made, that the Pipe entring almost at the top of Image 27 (page 20) the nearest, runneth down a-slope, to come out at the last hoop of the furthermost; afterwards the circumference of these holes must be strongly luted; then fill with water your Hogs-heads, which will be another strong Refrigeratory, and by condensing the Spirits and Vapours in their way, make a copious distillation in a small time. The open Limbick is made of two different pieces, viz. of a Body or Cucurbit, and its Head. The Body may be of Glass, Stone, or Earthen glaz'd ware, or of Brass: it is always higher than it is broad; broader in its middle than in its bottom, and broader at the bottom than at the top, and round in all its breadth, by which description you see that it is not unlike a Gourd. The head may be of the same matter as the body, and sometimes of Lead; the top of it rises in form of a point, the bottom is broad and proportioned to the body. In its lower part, it hath a brim inwards, on which the Vapours that rise in it fall, and gently distil to the Nose of the Pipe, which is of half a foot long, and conveys the liquors into the Receiver. These two Vessels, fitted one to another, serve to distil, and rectifie in a sand-fire, per assensum, the waters of Plants, Aqua vitae, Spirit of Wine, the phlegm Oyl, and Spirit of Vegetables and Animals, and to rectifie the Phlegm and Spirit of Minerals. Before you put your Cucurbit into the sand, you must lute two or three slices of white Paper upon the neck of your body, that so you may even it, and make it fit for the head, which must fit close: upon these slices of Paper round Page 21 about the Glass-body, tye a pack-thread with a loose knot; then with more Paper lute together the head, and its body over this pack-thread: the use of which, will be to undo easily these Vessels, one from another, by drawing the pack-thread, and so breaking the Papers, when the Operation shall be ended. If you expect not a considerable quantity of liquor from your matter, then make use of a small Receiver, which you may hang to the Nose of the Limbick, by a pack-thread fastned to the little button that is on the top of its head; but, if it be big, and you hope for much liquor, then place it carefully upon a little Stool, or upon Bricks laid one upon another. Blind Limbicks are made of a Cucurbit, and its head, sealed hermetically to it, of the bigness of ones fist: in the top of the head there is a little hole, fit to receive the small end of a Tunnel, by which the Liquors are poured into this Vessel, and in the lower part of the head, there is a nose by which the Liquors distil. Its use is, to rectifie the acid Spirits of Minerals, Vegetables and Animals, so that nothing be lost, nor exhale from them; and therefore you must carefully stop the hole, by which you put in your matter, with a Glass or Cork-stopple. Twins or Pelicans are two blind Limbicks, whose noses are reciprocally inserted into the Bodies of one another: they must both have a hole in the top, for the use mentioned in the other: they serve to fix and circulate the Oyls, and Spirits, with their Salts, of Animals, Vegetables and Minerals. Image 28 (page 22)  The Retort is a glass made up of a great belly, or ball, and a long bending neck, which near the belly is six or eight inches wide, but diminishing, still grows less, till its end be but wide enough to put your finger in; it serves to distil by the side of the Furnace, and ordinarily in a naked circulatory fire, the black Oyls, and Spirits of Minerals and Metals, and the stinking Oyls of Vegetables and Animals. The Iron or Earthen Retort, is like the Glass-one; only the neck is three inches diameter, near the belly, and two inches in its extremity; to the end, that gross and heavy ingredients may the easilier be put in: it serves to distil the Spirit, and stinking Oyls of Woods, Barks, Roots and Berries. The Matrass or Bolt-head is always of Glass, and may be of different sizes: it consists of a round bowl, convex in its bottom, with a neck half a foot long, or thereabouts, according to the bigness of the body; the neck is every where an inch wide: it serves to sublime Mercury, and divers Salts. The Recipient is a Matrass of any bigness, whose neck must be broken off four fingers breadth, near the belly; to the end that the extremity of the neck of the Retort may enter into the middle of the body of the Receiver: it serves to receive Waters, Essences, Oyls and Spirits of Animals, Vegetables, Minerals and Metals. The way to make a Recipient of a Matrass, is this: Heat the neck in that part where you intend Page 23 to cut it off, and when it is very hot, wet it, and so knock it with a hammer, and it will break there where it has been wet; if it be not very even, you may with a key even it by little and little. The Stone, or Earthen Receiver, is of the same figure with the Glass one, only it has a wider neck to receive the Nose of the Earthen Retort; you may use an Earthen Pitcher, if you cannot get a fit Receiver, so the neck of the Pitcher be straight, and the belly big and wide, taking care to lute it close with the Retort: but these Earthen Receivers are seldom used, except it be to receive the Spirits, and stinking Oyls of Wood, Rinds, Roots, Barks and Berries. The double Vessel in form of a Matrass, is a Matrass with a long neck, into which is inserted the neck of another Matrass of the same bulk; in the ball, though its neck be a little less, and may, if you will, also be shorter, and go but half way into the first Matrass; you must lute with three or four slices of Paper the Junction of these two Vessels, that nothing may exhale: it serves to extract by Infusion in a Sand-heat, all sorts of Tinctures. The double Vessel, in form of a Cucurbit or Body, is a Cucurbite of Glass, or Earth, upon whose mouth you place a Cup like your Cupping-Glasses, with the mouth downwards; it having a little brim, by which it is suspended upon the top of the Cucurbite: these two Vessels must be close luted together. The best Lute will be of Flower, or Starch, in form of a hasty Pudding. Image 29 (page 24) This Vessel serves to extract by infusion the tincture of Aromatick Flowers, that so nothing may be lost of their Spirit, and is fitter than the Pitcher ordinarily used to this purpose. The Bell is a great Glass-Vessel, like the Bell Gardiners use to cover Melons withal. The use of this is, to draw the Spirit and Oyl of Sulphur, of Salt Armoniack, of Antimony, and Mars, or Iron, by covering with it an Earthen Pan; and if you turn it with the mouth upwards, it serves for precipitations, and washings or lotions. The Glass-Tunnel, though it be open at both ends, yet we reckon it among the Vessels; as well, because sometimes by stopping the little end, it is really one, and contains Liquors, as because there is something worth observation in its Fabrick or making; it must have a straight long neck: because being used in the blind Alimbeck, it must reach as far as within the Body, and not spill upon the inward brim of it; it must not have so large a belly as the Tin-Tunnels, lest when you separate your distilled Oyl from their Phlegm and Spirit, much of the Oyls be lost by sticking to the large sides of your Tunnel. It serves to separate the Oyl from the acid Phlegm distilled with it, which is done by letting these two Liquors settle in the Tunnel, and then taking away your finger which stopped it, and giving leave to that Liquor which is lowermost to run out; which done, stop again the neck of your Tunnel, and let the remainder of your Liquor run into another Vial. It may be lined with a cornet Page 25 of brown Paper, through which are filtrated Lixiviums, Washings, and divers other things, and may also stand you in stead of a Tin-Tunnel. The Crucible is a pot; of which there are of different sizes. It is made of the same earth as white ware; it is round without a handle very narrow at the bottom, and wider and wider towards the top: it has a little Sinus or Cavity, by which the thing melted is poured out: it serves to calcine and melt Minerals and Metals, especially in a small quantity. The Camion, is a Pot like an ordinary Chamber-pot with a handle to it. It is made of Potters Earth, and Sand; and therefore it holds out strongly in the fire, which your Pots made of ordinary Earth do not, but fly. There are two sorts of these Pots, some are glazed, or leaded, and these serve to evaporate and dry; some are unglazed, and they serve to melt and calcine Minerals, and Metals, and every thing that needs such preparation, especially if you have a great quantity to prepare, these Camions being bigger than Crucibles. A Pan is an Earthen Vessel straight-bottom'd, and flat and wide-mouth'd. There are two sorts: Glazed, that serves to evaporate in a naked fire Extracts, Syrups, Pills, Plasters, &c. and Unglazed ones, which serve to evaporate in a Bath, or Sand heat, Salts, Crystals, &c. and to wash salt Remedies. In some of our Operations, we make use of Utensils of the Kitching; as Frying-Pans, to make Image 30 (page 26) the Oyl of Eggs; Kettles, and Brass Basins, to congeal the Crystal Mineral, and make our Cauteriums.   Of the Chymical Fire. IN the governing of the Chymical fire, there are four things to be considered; viz. 1. The materials of your fire; 2. The interposition of your fire; 3. The disposition of your fire; and, 4. The ordering, governing, or regimen of your degrees of fire. The Materials are of five sorts; whereof two are common, and the other three extraordinary, viz. Coal, Wood, a Lamp, the Beams of the Sun, helped by a Burning-glass, and Horse-dung. Your Coals must have two conditions to be good; they must be of good Wood, and of any Wood rather than of Oak, because all Oak-Coals flyes, and may break your Glasses. 2. They must be very dry, that they may make a quick live-fire, and spare you the labour of blowing; the best Coal is that which is of a middle size, round, and of a Beech-Tree: the Wood must have the same qualities, for the same reasons. The Lamp is a Tin-Box full of Oyl, in which swim three or four wicks, or links: this is set in the Lamp-Furnace; which serves to digest or distil, with a long and moderate heat, without any obligation of being present at the operation. Page 27 Because a Lamp-fire is very seldom used, we have not in the description of Furnaces made any mention of a Lamp-Furnace, neither will we here say any more of its figure, and proportions, nor of the Oyl that is to be used; being resolved to set down all these things more particularly in some of our Operations. The Sun-Beams serve to extract Tinctures; to make long digestions, to Calcine some Minerals, especially when the said Beams are gathered by a Burning-glass: which way we shall also describe at length in some of our Operations. The Horse-dung is used by putting into it Vessels sealed up hermetically, or close stopped, there to ferment and circulate. We shall also describe this way in some of our Operations. The Interposition of the Chymical fire, is of four sorts. 1. When between the Vessel and the Fire, there is nothing but two Iron-Bars, or a little Round to set the Vessel on, and this is called working by a naked fire. 2. When between the fire and the Vessel, there is an Iron-plate, or Brass Kettle, or an Earthen Pan, full of ashes or sand, into which the Vessel is sunk more or less; and this is called, Working with a Sand-fire, or of Ashes. 3. When between the fire and the Vessel, there is a Kettle full of Water, into which your Vessel is set up to the neck; and this is called, working by a Balneum Maris, or Mariae, that is, a Sea-Bath, or Maries Bath. 4. Is when between the fire and the Vessel, there is a Kettle full of Image 31 (page 28) Water, which Kettle is covered, and its Cover has five holes in it, upon which are placed as many Vessels to receive the Vapour of the Bath; and this is called Working by a Vaporous Bath. The disposition of the Chymical fire is of four sorts: 1. Where the fire is placed only under the Vessels, as is done in the five Furnaces following, viz. of the great and small Reverberatory of the circulary fire, of the sand fire, of the Balneum Maris, and Vaporous Bath; and observe, that though in the two first Furnaces the heat is by Reverberation as strong above as below the Vessels, yet the fire is only under them. 2. Where the Coals are laid only round about the Vessel upon the ground; and this is called Ignis rotae, or a circulary fire. 3. Where the Coals are not only laid round about the Vessel, but are heaped up to the top of it, and that is called a fire of half-suppression; but, if you cover even the top of your Vessel with Coals, then 'tis a fire of whole-suppression. 4. Where the fire is altogether above the Vessel, which is also a fire of suppression; and is used in distillations per descensum, for which Operation we make use of a great Earthen glazed Tunnel, of a little Iron Plate full of holes, and of a Kettle full of fire: which way of operating, we will teach more distinctly in some of our Processes. The Regimen or Degree of the Chymical fire, is also of four sorts: 1. When you give and continue a small fire, all along the Operation, as is practised in the first sublimation of dulcified Mercury. 2. When you give a moderate heat either Page 29 at first, for fear of breaking your glasses, or by little and little, when there is the like danger; and then maintain this heat in such an equality as to augment and diminish it when it passes the limits of moderation, as it is practised in the distillation of the Spirit of Wine; and in a sand-fire, where you stop your ash-hole door, and almost all your fire-room door; as also the hindmost Register, that so you may keep your Coals in that heat that they are in. 3. When you augment the heat by degrees, till you come to the last and greatest you can procure, and that soon after, that your operation ceases as it is practised in the distillation of the Oyl of Bricks. And observe here, that all the activity of the fire is divided into four degrees; a little fire is the first degree; a moderate is the second degree; a great fire is the third; and a very great and intense one is the fourth. 4. When you have augmented the fire by degrees, and are come to the last, which you maintain the space of some hours, as it is done in the distillation of the black Oyl of Vitriol, or Colcothar.   Image 32 (page 30) The Spirit of Salt. TAke a quantity of Potters-Earth, cut it into slices of the length, breadth and thickness of a finger, and set them in order upon a Grid-iron; which you shall set upon red Coals in a hot Oven after the bread is drawn: when they are dry on one side, turn them on the other; then take them out, and powder them in a Mortar: and keep this Earth, thus dried and powdered, as well for this Operation, as for divers others. Mingle five parts of this Earth, thus prepared, with one part of common Salt, beaten to powder, but not decrepitated; with this matter fill a Glass-Retort, of an ordinary size, which must be luted up to half the neck; set it in a close Reverberatory, and fit it to a large and capacious Glass-Receiver. Give your fire by degrees, coming as soon as you can to the last degree, which continue twenty four hours, or till your Recipient seem cold, though the Retort be violently hot; from whence you may infer, that your matter hath sent out all its Spirits: out of one pound of Salt by this method, you'll draw nine or ten ounces of Spirits. Observe, 1. This Earth is given to the Salt as an intermedium to hinder its fusion: for Salt melts in a great fire, and being once melted, becomes so fix, as there is no raising of its Spirits to distil them. Page 31  Observe, 2. That we rather make use of a Glass, than of an Earthen Retort; because, the Spirits of Salt being very acid, and something corrosive, might so penetrate the Earth of the Retort, as to lose something of their virtue, and dull their activity; therefore you must also keep your Spirit of Salt in Glass, not in Earthen Vessels. Observe, 3. That the Salt must not be decrepitated, that is, separated from its Phlegm, nor the Clay absolutely dried, or heat red in the fire: for it is necessary, that there should remain some watrish humidity in both: to the end, that this phlegm coming, first in distillation, may help the acid Spirits, and be as a Vehicle to them; otherwise, were your fire never so violent, if there were no Phlegm, you would never obtain any acid Spirits. Observe, 4. That your Retort must be filled up to the neck, because the Spirits, in their first rising and separating themselves from their grosser parts, would, if there were any Vacuum, presently re-impregnate themselves, and be so fix'd, as that no power of fire would be able to raise them again, and make them Volatil: whereas the Vapours raised, meeting with no empty room in the Retort, are not able to condense there, but by the fire are forced into the Recipient; into which they enter in form of a white Vapour, which by little and little cools, and condenses, and at last dissolves into a Liquor white and clear as water. Observe, 5. That that Phlegm which first Image 33 (page 32) comes is little in quantity; and if you will have your Spirit strong and pure, you may deflegmate and rectifie it in a sand-heat. Its vertue and use is, It resists all corruption taken interiourly, and outwardly applied; and for this reason in venomous and malign Feavers, we mingle three or four drops of it with a Cordial Julip: and for a preservation against the Plague, we put a spoonful of it into a quart of Oxycrate, and so rub the body all over before a good fire: It whitens the Teeth admirably, being mingled with a little Water, or some syrup; it's a powerful diuretick against suppressions of Urine, caused by the oppilation of the conducts thorow which it should pass: it drives the Gravel out of the Kidneys and Bladder; and so is specifick to break the Stone of the Kidneys and Bladder; that if you put a Stone cut out of a humane Bladder, into a quantity of Spirit of Salt, it will dissolve immediately without fire, or any addition of any thing, though it were never so hard; it is used to dissolve Gold, and make it Potable: if you do whet its Vertue, by putting to it a little Salt decrepitated before you put your Gold in it; alone it dissolves Pearls and Coral. The marks whereby you may know and distinguish this Spirit from others, are these; 1. That it is clear and white, drawing to a citrine, transparent colour. 2. Being newly made, it is Vaporous, and seizes the nose presently, but without stink; and being old, it has no odour at all. 3. That upon your tongue it is of an acid biting faltish taste. 4. It neither Page 33 corrodes, nor tinges of any colour its cork-stopple.   Spirit of Niter. MIngle one part of fine and well purified Niter, with four or five parts of Potters Earth prepared, as in the Chapter of Spirit of Salt; fill with this, a Glass-Retort well luted up to its neck; place it in a close Reverberatory Furnace, fitting to it a large and capacious Recipient; give your fire by degrees, till you come to the highest, which continue twenty four hours. The Phlegm will come first, and in small quantity, and also with a little Spirit, which will appear in the Recipient in form of a White Vapour; a little after the pure Spirit will come, appearing in form of red Vapours, which will make your Recipient bright, and red as a Ruby. Out of one pound of Niter thus distilled, you may have four ounces of Spirit. Obs. 1. That you must be very exact in luting your Retort close with your Recipient; lest many of your Vapours should exhale: and however, the Artist must have a care of coming too near at that time; lest the Sulphureous, and Malign Vapours of the Niter (which our Authors call the flying Dragon) should offend his Brain, and Nerves, and make him Paralytick, by the fusion and resolution of the humours of the Brain, which at that time Image 34 (page 34) borrowing from the subtle Nitrous Vapours an extraordinary thinness and penetration, would easily insinuate themselves into the nerves, and by their abundance, cause a total Obstruction. Obs. 2. That we give the Potters Earth to Niter, as we do to Salt, to hinder its fusion: now Niter is very easily melted, because it is the Body which helps other Bodies to be so too; by reason of its great thinness, the abundance of its Sulphureous substance, and its penetration; but when once it has been melted, it becomes so fix, that, having lost all its Sulphur, it can neither evaporate, nor be inflamed, though you put it into the fire: Then therefore it is called Salt of Niter, being fix as Salts; whereas before its fusion, it was so strangely Volatil, that when you did but put a Coal into it, it presently was in such a flame, that it was almost quite consumed. Obs. 3. That for this Operation we make use of very fine purified Niter; because the purer it is, the less it hath of fixed Salt in it, and therefore yields more Spirits; you may learn in the Chapter of Crystal-Mineral, how Niter is purified, and that in its purifying, it is devested of its fixt Salt. Obs. 4. and 5. That the Retort must be of Glass, and filled up to the neck, for the reasons alledged in the precedent Operation. Obs. 6. That the Phlegm which comes first in the distillation, is in a very small quantity, and cannot be separated from the Spirit by rectification; because this Spirit is so Volatil, that it comes of a sudden conjointly with the Phlegm, and so Page 35 the rectification would be unnecessary; the Phlegm being in so small a proportion to the Spirit, as not to be able to make the last lose any thing of its activity and energy. Its Vertues and use: This Spirit is Corrosive, not only applyed to Warts, rotten Flesh, and the Gangreen, but it corrodes and dissolves Mercury, and the other Metals; it is often to be preferr'd to Aqua fortis, for these two uses; or it is not so burning in its action upon the flesh, as Aqua fortis; and it is much fitter for the dissolutions which are made by it of Mercury, and other Metals and Minerals, in order to the preparing of some remedy to be taken inwardly, as well because pure Niter is an acid aperitive, and pure Vitriol is an acid vometive; as because Niter, being a Sulphureous Salt, drawn from temperate Animals, and Vitriol, a terrestrious Salt drawn from Minerals, by their union in the composition of Aqua fortis, is produced a malignous quality. Nay, it is fitter than Aqua fortis, for the dissolution of Minerals in order to make Fucuses for the face, because the Spirit of Niter, applyed to the skin, leaves but a little yellow spot, which may be easily taken away; whereas Aqua fortis leaves a deep orange-spot, so sticking, and adhering, that it can never be taken out, but with the loss of the skin; from whence we may infer, that a Fucus prepared with Aqua fortis, should rather black than whiten the skin. The marks to distinguish this Spirit, are these: 1. That it is of the same colour and transparency as the Spirit of Salt. 2. That it is very vaporous Image 35 (page 36) and stinking, coming near the stinking smell of Aqua fortis. 3. It is too corrosive and biting, to be tasted upon the Tongue; but, to try its goodness, pour out some drops upon a Brass half-peny, and, if it be right, it will presently boil, and makes the half-peny stir, it produces a blew colour in the said half-peny. 4. It corrodes, and makes its Linen-stopple look yellow, as Aqua fortis uses to do; sometimes the Spirits of Vitriol and Sulphur are sophisticated by putting a little Spirit of Niter, or a little Aqua fortis into common Water, till there result an acid taste, which is not caustick: but you shall perceive this cheat, if having rubbed a Paper with the Spirits of Vitriol and Sulphur in one place, and the Spirit of Niter and common Water in another place, you present the said Paper to the fire; for then the place rubb'd with the Spirits of Vitriol and Sulphur, will grow black and break; and the place rubb'd with Spirit of Niter in common Water, will only grow yellow, and not break.   The Spirit and black Oyl of Vitriol. TAke an Earthen-pot unglazed, of the Earth they make Crucibles of, fill it up to the brim with good green Vitriol; set this pot upon a Salt-seller in a great Circulatory fire: in two hours time, or there abouts, your Vitriol having first dissolved into a Liquor, will be dryed, deflegmated, Page 37 and at last coagulated into a grayish lump; then take out your pot, let it cool, and, when cold, put your matter into a Brass or Iron Mortar, and powder it. Take a Glass Retort, well luted up to half the neck; fill it with the said Vitriol, and place it according to Art, in a great Reverberatory fire, fitting to it a great Receiver. Give your fire by degrees, coming as soon as you can to the last, which continue till you perceive, in the top and sides of your Receiver, a kind of black Veins that trickle down to the bottom; these are the black Oyl which begins to distil. Then unlute your Receiver from its Retort, and separate by inclination, the acid Spirit of Vitriol, which hitherto has been distilled, and which is of a white and transparent colour like Water, and which entered your Receiver in the form of a white Vapour. By this time your Vitriol will be calcin'd into a red colour, and brought to be a Colcothar, which yet retains its black Oyl. Which to extract, you must again fit the Receiver to its Retort without lute; for else, the neck of the Retort being exceeding hot, would presently break by the approach of the cold, and moist Lute; continue then your fire, and give it in the highest degree, for the space of six, or eight hours, till your Receiver be cold, though the fire be vehement under the Retort, by that you'll perceive that the contain'd matter has yielded all its black and thick Oyl. Let your fire go out: then take out your Retort, which by the Image 36 (page 38) long violence of the fire will seem somewhat sunk and straitned, and in it will remain a Colcothar, devested of its phlegm, its Spirit, and its black Oyl; but yet containing the fixed Salt of Vitriol, and therefore is not so sharp and acrimonious as the first Colcothar. 'Tis out of this second Colcothar, that you may extract the Caput mortuum of Vitriol, by making a Lexivium of the said Colcothar, to extract its fixed Salt. Out of one pound of green Vitriol, you'll have nine or ten ounces of Spirit, with its Phlegm, and half an ounce of black Oyl. The acid Spirit of Vitriol contains much Phlegm, which came first with it; therefore if you desire to have a purified Spirit, you must evaporate the Phlegm by putting this Spirit Inflegmated into a Matrass not luted, which set upon a Salt-seller in a small Circulatory fire, till the whole substance be half diminished, and begin to look a little yellowish; if you continue this Evaporation any longer, your Spirit will become blackish, drawing near the colour and acidity of your Oyl of Colcothar. If reciprocally with the said black Oyl of Colcothar, you desire to make a white acid Spirit, do but mingle in a Matrass one dragm of the said Oyl with an ounce of common water; then you shall see that the said Oyl will presently go to the bottom; and will so heat the neck of the Matrass, that you will scarce be able to hold it in your hand. Mingle them well by agitation, till the water grow blackish, then through Paper filtrate the said liquor, and there will come a clear Page 39 acid Spirit, as yellow as Gold, which will have the same force and virtue as the common Spirit of Vitriol; the Paper retaining the black and thick faeces. From whence we may conclude, that this clear Liquor, which we call Spirit of Vitriol, is nothing but a small portion of the true Spirit mingled with a great deal of Phlegm, and that this black Liquor which we call Oyl, is indeed a pure Spirit of Vitriol, entirely dephlegmated, but because of its Sulphureous blackness and thickness, it is improperly called Oyl, being somewhat unctuous to the feeling, though it be not at all inflameable, as all true Oyls are. Obs. 1. That you must dephlegmate the Vitriol, and powder it well before you put it into your Retort; else you would not draw off the Spirit, but the Phlegm alone: for, the matter would coagulate in the bottom of the Vessel into a lump, which sticking close to the sides of the Retort, would so retain all the Spirits, that a strong fire of forty hours lasting, would scarce be able to reduce this mass to powder: therefore it is better to dephlegmate and reduce to powder your Vitriol, before it be put into the Retort. Obs. 2. That we give no Intermedium to Vitriol, as we do to Salt and Niter; because, being a terrestrious Salt, it cannot be melted, and by consequent, cannot fix and retain its Spirits within its self: so that, provided it be dephlegmated, the Spirits are easily raised, and distilled by the violence of the fire. Image 37 (page 40)  Obs. 3. That you need not fill your Retort up to the neck with your matter, because the Spirit of Vitriol, having not so much tenuity as the Spirits of Salt and Niter, is not in danger of reimpregnating and fixing its self in its own masse. Obs. 4. That the Retort must be of Glass, for the reason alledged in the Spirit of Salt. Obs. 5. That you chuse good Vitriol, not too dry; for it will yield more Spirit and Oyl: therefore that which comes from Germany and the Low Countries, is better than the Roman Vitriol for this effect. Its virtue and effects: Both the white Spirit, and the black Oyls, are Acids, which pleasantly and excellently do cool, desopilate, and resist all corruption: and therefore they are frequently, and with good success, made use of for the Liver and Kidneys, in burning and Pestilentious Feavers. The dose is five or six drops of the Spirit, two or three of the Oyl, either in Water, Broth, or White Wine: It serves for the dissolution of Metals; and in Surgery it is used, either pure, or mingled with a little water or Mel rosatum, to touch the ulcers of the mouth. The first and second Colcothar are both an excellent Astringent, given in violent Diarrhoea's, Dysenteries, and Hepatick Fluxes: or, mingled with some unguents, it stops bleeding Wounds. The Marks to distinguish the Oyl of Vitriol from other, are these: 1. It is very black: 2. It is not only acid, but caustick: 3. It is very Page 41 heavy: 4. It seizes the nose, with a strong Vapour, when new made; and in all these four conditions, it is like the Oyl of Sulphur. As for the Spirit, it is known by its pleasant acidity, by its yellowish colour: and because, being old, it yields no smell, no more than Spirit of Sulphur, neither doth it corrode, or make its stopple yellow; the Spirits of Niter and Aqua fortis, are distinguished from it by their smell; and because they corrode, and change the colour of their stopples: Spirit of Salt is known from it, because it has a brackish taste, and smells strong when new, being much more intolerable and unpleasant than Spirit of Vitriol.   Aqua Fortis. TAke a Glass-Retort luted up to half its neck, put in it equal parts of common Niter, and green Vitriol, not dephlegmated, but they must be beaten to powder in an Iron Mortar before: fill but two thirds of your Retort, leaving a third empty, for else the Vitriol being melted by the Niter, would, it may be, rise, and run in substance into the Recipient, before the distillation of the Aqua fortis could be begun. Set your Retort in a little Reverberatory, or in a little Circulatory fire, (a great Reverberatory being not so necessary here, because the Niter is of it self so volatil; and having melted the Vitriol, it makes it likewise capable of yielding its Spirits Image 38 (page 42) without a very violent degree of heat.) Give your fire by degrees; continuing the first degree, till the phlegm, which will appear in a white vapour in the Recipient, be distilled; otherwise, if at first you did give a great heat, the Niter and Vitriol together would boil over your Vessel, and in their own substance run into the Recipient: When your Recipient begins to fill with red Vapours, (which is the sign of the Spirit's coming forth) augment your fire, and cover your Retort with Coals; if it be in a Circulatory fire, continue this heat till your Recipient begin to lose something of the brightness of its red colour, and till it become cold, though the fire be vehement under the Retort: then the matter has sent forth all its Spirits, and you shall find these red Vapours dissolved all into a white clear Liquor, as water: Out of one pound of common Niter, and as much of green Vitriol undephlegmated, you may have sixteen ounces of Aqua fortis. Obs. 1. That though the Spirit of Vitriol cannot be drawn from Vitriol undephlegmated, yet Aqua fortis may; because being in company with the Niter, it cannot, after the distillation of its Phlegm, coagulate in a lump, which might fix and retain its Spirits; the Niter, by its opening Sulphur, keeping the Vitriol porous and vaporous. Obs. 2. That Aqua fortis may be very well made with dephlegmated Vitriol, and fine Niter; and then it is so strong and corrosive, that it is Aqua regalis, and can dissolve Gold and Silver: but Page 43 because we do not ordinarily need in Chymistry so strong a dissolvent, for the frequent dissolutions we make of Mercury, of Tin, of Bismuth, and of Silver; we are content with Aqua fortis prepared as has been taught. Its virtue and use: This is a very caustick burning water; some do touch Warts and Corns with it: but it is dangerous so to do, and our Chymistry will afford us gentler and fitter remedies, which I shall set down hereafter. It serves to dissolve your Metals and Minerals: the Dyers use it, to give a strength and penetration to their Colours. The Marks to distinguish it, are, 1. It is yellowish. 2. Stinks very much. 3. It yellows and corrodes its stopple, and the bladder and pack-thread that are employed about the stopping of it. 4. If you pour a drop or two of it upon a Brass-half-peny, it makes it stir, and look green.   The Spirit and black Oyl of Sulphur. TAke a great Stone, or unglazed Earthen Pan, put it into a pound of common water; in the middle of this Pan, set a little Stone-pot, and upon this Pot, place a little flat Earthen Cup full of sand: in the mean time, reduce into powder four pound of Brimstone, and of this Image 39 (page 44) put one spoonful into the middle of the sand, then take a great Coach-wheel Nail, and heat it red hot, and with a pair of Tongs put the head of it into this Brimstone which is in the sand, presently the Brimstone will be in a flame: therefore have ready a Glass-Bell well proportioned to the bigness of your Pan, and with it cover your Pan, as soon as the Brimstone begins to take fire; and that you may lose nothing of the Vapour, stop with Linen the junction of the Bell and Pan; from this inflamed Sulphur will rise an abundance of white Vapours, which will be converted, part of them into acid Spirits, which being received in the Pan, impregnate the Water; and part of them into yellow Flowers of Sulphur, which will be found sticking to the sides of the Bell and Pan, and will form a little skin upon the superflicies of the Water. After a quarter of an hour, the Vapours being ceased, and condensed into Spirits and Flowers; break that skin, that the Water may be at liberty to re-impregnate it self with new Spirits, at a second flagration; then put another spoonful of Sulphur, inflame it, cover it, and in a word, do as before, continuing this till all your Brimstone be spent. When you have done, there remains a muddy acid Water, into which put all those Flowers of Brimstone, which you find sticking to the sides of your Pan, or Bell, as likewise those that swim upon the Water; put them all together into a Matrass of an ordinary size not luted, which set upon a Salt-seller in the little Circulatory fire; the Phlegm will be evaporated, the Flowers Page 45 will dissolve into the Spirit, and the Spirit will wax black; then with a wet clout take out your Retort, and pour out your Liquor thus hot, into a white Earthen Bason. The Spirit being cool, you'll find in the bottom the Flowers congealed into a bright yellow lump. By this method in one day, out of four pound of Sulphur you may draw half an ounce of black Oyl; and if you put an ounce of Water upon one dram of this Oyl, mingling them well in a Matrass, and then filtring them through a course Paper, you may have that which is called the Spirit, or Acid of Brimstone, of a yellow bright transparent colour like Gold. Or, by another way, do but evaporate the two thirds of your pound of Water, impregnated with the Spirit of Brimstone, and there will remain four ounces of a yellow inflegmated Spirit. Obs. 1. That we put sand into the little Earthen Cup, lest the Brimstone, inflamed, should break it; which it would do, were it empty. Obs. 2. That, Water is put into the Pan, that the Spirits may be the better gathered, without which they would be apt to be consumed to no purpose, in the superficies and substance of the said Earthen Pan. Obs. 3. That the Matrass in which the Evaporation is performed, must be short-neck'd, that the phlegm may the easilier evaporate; therefore let it be two inches high. Obs. 4. That we pour the said Spirit hot into a white Basin, and not into a glazed one, lest it should corrode the Lead of the Vernish, and so be Image 40 (page 46) weakned, and loaden with a blackness, which no filtration would be able to take away: and the reason why we pour out the Liquor hot, is, because if we did let it cool, the Brimstone would congeal into such a lump, as could never be come by, without breaking the Matrass. Obs. 5. That, if by this method there is but little Spirit drawn from such a quantity of Sulphur, yet by all the other processes you meet with in Authors, you shall draw less. Its virtue and use: It cools and purifies the Blood, resists Corruption, appeases the Burning Feavers. 'Tis a very good preservative against the Plague, taking three or four drops of it in a glass of water ever morning. It is most excellent to touch Venereal Ulcers and Warts; it dissolves Pearls and Corral: It fixes Mercury; but cannot dissolve him, no more than the other Metals. The Marks by which it is distinguished, are the same by which Spirit of Vitriol is known from other Spirits; but all the difficulty is to distinguish Spirit of Vitriol from Spirit of Sulphur.   Spirit of Wine. TAke as much good Aqua vitae, as will fill your Vesica or Copper body half full: set it in a naked Circulatory fire; fit to it its cover or Moors-head, bordered with its Refrigeratory, Page 47 having before hand put into the Vesica's long neck five or six sponges, held up by two sticks set a-cross, and kept from falling down or rising up: Then to the Moors-head Nose fit the moveable Pipe, which shall join it with the long Brass Pipe that goes through the two Hogs-heads of water; then starch on long slices of Paper upon all the conjunctions of the Pipes; and over the Paper, put cloth-ones, which bind fast with pack-thread: fit your Receiver of glass to the lower end of the long Brass Pipe that goes through the Hogs-heads; set your Coals on fire, and add some wood to them, to make at first a great fire, which may raise and distil your Spirit quickly. In a very little time, it will come not by drops, but in a small stream like a Fountain. In all the course of this Operation, there must be singular care taken that the distillation be equal and moderate, so that as soon as you perceive white vapours in the Recipient, diminish your fire; either by throwing ashes on it, or taking a good deal of it away. For these white Vapours are the Spirits which come in such an abundance, that they have not had time to condense, neither in the Moors-head, nor in the long Pipe, and therefore will easily scape out of your Receiver, and so the best of your Spirit will be lost to no purpose: besides, whensoever the Distillation is performed in too big a stream, though there be no Vapours, yet diminish your fire. But if it should come drop by drop, then augment the heat; you may take notice that the first quart that comes, though excellent and pure, yet it is not clear, Image 41 (page 48) but muddy, having contracted a foulness from the sides of the Vessel; therefore throw it in again with a Tunnel by the little Pipe, which on purpose is in the top of the Vesica, and presently stop the said Pipe close with its Woodden stopper; the Spirit that shall from henceforth be distilled, will be clear and transparent. By this method, out of thirty quarts of good Aqua vitae, you may draw eighteen quarts of good Spirit of Wine in a day, and in one only Vesica. You must observe often, all along your Operation, whether your Spirit be well deflegmated; which try thus: Put as much Gunpowder as you can take up with your two fore-fingers and your thumb, into a little spoon, which fill with Spirit of Wine; then fire it with a Match, or lighted Paper: for if this Spirit take fire and burn blew, till it be consumed, and then fire the Gunpowder, and that at last there be no mark of any moistness left in the spoon, you may be sure your Spirit is very pure, and very good. The last Spirit that comes, is not good, as well because it brings phlegm with it, as because it smells of the Empyreuma, or burning; and having been long in the Vesica, is somewhat impregnated with the substance and qualities of the Copper. Therefore set it aside to be used exteriourly, or in Mechanicks; or else rectifie it again with new Brandy. Whensoever your perceive that there comes some muddy whitish drops, which make the clear Spirit which was in the Receiver change its colour, then know that it is time to make an end of the Operation: for these drops are Page 49 the flegm which produces this effect upon the pure Spirit: for if you put two or three drops of Water into good Spirit of Wine, it will do the same thing. There will remain in the Vesica twelve quarts of flegm muddy and greenish from the Copper; this tincture is to be thrown away. This Spirit of Wine does also contain in it self something of the Copper: nevertheless it may be taken safely by the mouth, because that Copper extracted by this Spirit, is not so dangerous as Verdigreece extracted out of Copper by Vinegar. Nay, the Copper does contribute much to the preservation of this Spirit in its force. But, if in a Glass Alembick you will take the pains to rectifie it, and reduce your eighteen quarts to fifteen, then you may without scruple use it in all manners; and in the bottom of your Cucurbit, there will remain a green tincture, which is a flegm impregnated, with the Salt and Sulphur of Venus, or Copper. Which tincture evaporated, congeals into blew Crystals; then powdred and dissolved in common Water, filtred, and then evaporated a second time, will again in a cold Cellar congeal into blew transparent Crystals of Venus. Its virtue and use: Spirit of Wine is a powerful Dissolver for all sorts of Gums and Rosins, as well for the use of Physick, as to make China-Vernish: it is good for Burnings, Contusions, Gangreens, Palsie, cold Fluxions; particularly, if it be circulated with Salt of Tartar, it serves to extract perfectly the tincture of all Barks, Rinds, Image 42 (page 50) Woods, Berries, Aromatick, Balsamick, and Resinous, as also of Opium; to make of them Magisteries, Extracts, Essences and Syrops.   The Phlegm, Spirit, and Oyl of Turpentine. FIll half the fourth part of a Brass Vesica with clear Venice Turpentine; pour upon it common Water, till the Vessel be but half full, lest if it were fuller, the Turpentine should boil up, and run in its own substance into the Receiver. Fit to the Vesica the Moors-head, bordered with its Refrigeratory, omitting the sponges in the neck, because the Liquor here is not spiritous enough to pass through them. Give your fire, and govern your Operation altogether as has been taught in the Chapter of Spirit of Wine. The Flegm, Spirit and Oyl, will come altogether; but the Flegm will sink to the bottom of your Receiver, whereas the Spirit and Oyl will swim above. There will remain in the Vesica a thick substance called Colophon. Separate your Flegm by a Glass-Tunnel, and keep the Spirit and Oyl incorporated together. This Oyly Spirit is sold by Druggists in Paris, under the name of Spirit of Turpentine: they have it from Provence, and afford it us at a much cheaper rate, than we could make it at Paris. Page 51  How to separate entirely the Spirit from the Oyl. Fill a Glass-Retort half full, (your Retort must be luted, only there must be upon the neck a long empty space left to see into it, that so you may perceive towards the end of the Operation, of what colour your Oyl is:) set your Retort upon a Round, in the little Circulatory fire, and distil your matter, till you have three parts of Spirit out of it, and that in the bottom of your Retort you see a thick red Oyl, almost of the colour of a Pomgranate. Take then your Retort off from the fire, and pour out this hot Oyl into an Earthen Pan of white ware. As for the Spirit which you have in the Receiver, rectifie it again in the same Retort, and by the same sort of fire, so as to distil three quarters and an half in Spirit, and the rest remain in form of a thick red Oyl: which done, pour out the said Oyl to that which you have already. Then rectifie your Spirit again, doing thus, as long as you can extract any Oyl out of it: then your Spirit will be right and pure, devested of its Oyl, and without smell; but it will still have its force and acrimony. The Use and Virtues of the Spirit. 'Tis a powerful Diuretick, and makes the Gonorrhaea's flow abundantly, by melting and inciding those tough and clammy humours, which stop the passages of Sperm and Urine: It dissolves the soft Stones which are not yet strongly petrified: It dissolves all Gums better than Spirit of Wine, and that without any additional heat, either of Fire or Sun; Therefore it is used in making the best Vernish: it dissolves with a small heat Brimstone, Image 43 (page 52) and makes a better Balsam of it than that which is made with the oyly Spirit of Turpentine, bought at the Druggists. The Provencals, who are great Drawers of Essences, use it in all their Operations, either upon Flowers or Woods, Barks, Leaves or Berries, both Aromatick and Balsamick, because this Spirit being naturally unctuous, is easily impregnated with the oyly Essence of these Druggs; and because it has no smell of its own, it easily takes the Aromatick or Balsamick Odour of any of those that are infused in it, and then distil it in the Vesica, as we do Spirit of Wine. For do not think that their Essences are pure, and drawn from their Druggs alone: no, they are nothing but Spirit of Turpentine, impregnated with the Essence of them. So that this Spirit has a double use; for it extracts the Essence, and multiplies it considerably. The Virtues and Use of the red Oyl: It is a Sovereign Anodynum for the wounds of nervous parts, because it has lost all its Acrimony, which consisted in its Spirits.   Page 53 The Salt of Tartar, of which is made the Oyl of Tartar by solution of the Salt. TAke equal parts of pure Nitar and good Tartar, either white or red; powder them apart very fine: then mingle them in a glazed earthen Pan; then, with a red hot Iron, stir all this masse, until the Niter be entirely consumed and evaporated, which you shall know by the ceasing of flagration or burning. Thus your Tartar, being perfectly calcin'd, will afford you a Salt as white as Snow, and the same in weight with that which you mingled with the Niter at first; whence you may conclude, that Tartar is all Salt. The Oyl of Tartar is made thus: Set this Salt in a very wet air, such as the air of a Celler, there it will melt, and dissolve into a white viscous Liquor, which we call Oyl of Tartar by solution, to distinguish it from the black stinking Oyl, which is drawn by distillation in a Retort and open fire: nevertheless, to speak properly, the name of Oyl is not due to either of them, because they are neither Sulphurous nor inflamable substances. If after you have made the Salt of Tartar, you are in haste to have the Oyl, you may presently compass your end by throwing eight ounces of common Water upon four ounces of this Salt of Tartar; for then it will all dissolve into Liquor. Obs. 1. That you chuse good Tartar; for that Image 44 (page 54) is all Salt: whereas the grosser sort of Tartar has much of faeces, and terrestreity in it, which would spoil this Operation, in which we pretend to dissolve all the Salt into Water. Obs. 2. That your Niter be well devested of all its fixt Salt, because we desire here a pure Salt of Tartar, without the mixtion of any other: therefore your Niter must be entirely volatil, and exhale all in the flagration. Obs. 3. That they both be well powder'd, and mingled together, that so the Niter penetrating the Tartar, do throughly calcine it; and it is for this reason that we use an equal quantity of Niter: By this method the Tartar is far better and easilier calcin'd than by the naked fire, without any Intermedium. Obs. 4. That we make use here of an earthen glazed Pan, without any fear that the Niter should corrode the Lead of the Vernish; because its flame is not retained, but is at liberty to exhale. An unglazed or stone-Pan would be unfit for the Operation, because it would presently break by the Inflammation of the Niter. The Virtues and Use of the Salt: 'Tis a great Aperitive, Deopilative, and Diuretick; the dose is from one to two dragms, in some Broth, or any other appropriated Liquor. The Tartar Vitriolated, because of the grateful acidity which it borroweth from the Vitriol, is much more pleasant to take than this Salt. This Salt, in the quantity of half a scruple, will extract in a quarter of an hour the virtue and tincture of half an ounce of Senna, in a glass of cold water, and at the same Page 55 time proves a good Corrective to the noisom smell and taste of the Senna, giving it also the virtue of penetrating into all the Veins. The Oyl of Tartar is very scouring and drying; and is therefore excellent to rub all Scabs, Itch, and Tetters; as also to take away Spots, and Sunburns upon the Hands and Face. It is useful to precipitate the dissolutions of Metals, and Half-metals, or Marcasites. And pray, by the By, take notice, That all Acids, as Sea-water, distilled Vinegar, Oyl of Tartar, Spirit, and black Oyl of Sulphur; and Vitriol, Spirit of Niter, and Aqua fortis, serve to precipitate the dissolutions of Minerals: but that ordinary common Water, serves to precipitate the Distillations and Calcinations of Minerals; as also the Dissolutions of Vegetables made in Spirit of Wine, for the Reasons which hereafter we shall alledge.   Crystal Mineral, or Lapis Prunellae. TAke a Pot of the same Earth that Crucibles are made of, of the bigness of a Chamber-pot, and like it in Figure, with a handle; set it upon two Bricks in a great Circulatory Fire of Suppression: before the Pot be heated, throw into it as much pure Salt-peter in powder, as will fill it up to the brim; the Salt-peter will melt; and as soon as it is melted, throw into it a spoonfull Image 45 (page 56) of Brimstone in powder, which immediately will take fire, and be consumed: when the flame ceases, throw in as much more, and so do three or four times. This Brimstone does not communicate any virtue to the Niter, only serves to purifie it, by precipitating its Faeces to the bottom of the Pot, till it become so transparent, that after these Projections and Flagrations, you may see the bottom of the Pot through the melted Niter. This done, pour a little of this melted Niter into a Brass-tinn'd-Kettle, and presently set your Pot upon the fire again, having taken away a good part of the Coals round about it; then stir your Kettle so, as to make the Niter spread it self all over the bottom of your Vessel; which done, set it in a bigger Vessel full of cold Water, that so you may hinder the Niter from burning, and adhering too strongly to the bottom of your Kettle: separate then at last this white Crust, which is as thin and as brittle as Glass, and as white as Alabaster, and is by some called Crystal Mineral. After this, take more melted Niter out of your Pot, pour it into your Kettle, and do all things as before, continuing till there be nothing left in the Pot but the Faeces of the Niter, which you may throw away. Then gather all these thin Crystals together, and put them into a Kettle of Water upon the Fire, there to dissolve by a gentle ebullition; and if all dissolve not, it is a sign there is not Water enough. When all is dissolved, take off your Kettle, and filter this Liquor presently, while it is warm, through a brown Paper, Page 57 over an earthen unglaz'd Cucurbite. Then set the said Cucurbite in a Sand-heat, there to evaporate, till there appear upon the Superficies a thin skin; then take it off, let it cool; the Niter will crystallize into Needles of a sexangulary Figure, white, clear, and transparent, as any Rock-Crystal; but as brittle as Glass, and of a pleasant and grateful acidity. And then it is properly called Crystal Mineral, because of its resemblance with Crystal. Some call it Lapis Prunellae; and that is, because it is sharp and sowre, like your wild Prunes or Plums. Obs. 1. That we make use of a Pot of the same Earth that the Crucibles are made of, and not of an ordinary earthen-glaz'd Pot, because the Niter being once melted, would also dissolve the ledding of the Pot; and being incorporated with it, would lose much of its whiteness. Obs. 2. That we fill the Pot full up to the brim, that we may make at once a great quantity of Crystal Mineral; and because the Niter melted will take up but half the room it did before, being no ways subject to rise and run over. Obs. 3. That you must beat to powder your Niter; for so, a greater quantity will be contained in the Pot, and also be easilier melted. Obs. 4. That you must not stay till your Pot be warm, before you put in your Niter; because the Pot being very hot, and the flegm of the Niter coming to be dissolved first, would be broke infallibly. Therefore put in your Niter at first; and so by degrees, as your Pot warms, your Niter will Image 46 (page 58) be deflegmated: and yet observe, That if you throw a spoonful of Niter into a pot red-hot, it will not break, because there is too little flegm for so much heat. Obs. 5. That the Niter being hot enough, melts and is deflegmated; it melts by the means of its flegm; for it is the flegm that puts all Salts into fusion. And whensoever Salts are entirely calcined or deflegmated, they cannot be melted, except they be wet anew by some washings, and then they grow whiter. Obs. 6. That if while the Niter is deflegmatizing, there chance to fall into it any small live Coal, then it will all be in a flame, till the Coal be consumed; and, to extinguish this flame, there is no way but to take out the said Coal, and to cover the pot. Obs. 7. That if after the melting of your Niter, and the purifying of it by the different injections of Brimstone, you do not take off your pot, or take away some Coals, and the two first rounds of Bricks of your Furnace, that then your Niter will break the pot, though it were of Iron; and then the fire will inflame your Niter: which inflamed, will all exhale, and vanish away. The reason why the pot will be broken, is, because that then the Spirits of the Niter, being strongly heated, fly out of their body, and so corrode and break the pot. Obs. 8. That the Niter does not take fire in the pot; because, that though a spoonful of Niter cast into a pot red-hot, will presently be in a flame, and vanish all away in smoak; yet a great Page 59 quantity of Niter, even after its deflegmations, cannot be set a-fire, but by a red-hot Coal, unless you use a fire of Suppression, and so penetrate the pot, as to make it fire the Niter. And that cannot be done, because in such an Operation, an Earthen or Iron Pot or Crucible would break, and a Glass one would melt down. Obs. 9. That the Niter, being melted, is not afterwards coagulated into a lump upon the fire, as Vitriol and Alum use to do; because they are gross terrestrious Salts, which Niter is not. Obs. 10. That you must take well purified Niter, that so there be less of fix'd Salt in it: for, the fix'd Salt is easily dissolved into Water; and therefore your Niter being clear of it, will make your Crystals whiter and drier; if you use ordinary unrefin'd Niter, your Crystals will be apt to dissolve into Water. Obs. 11. That the Brimstone takes fire in the melted Niter, and yet inflames not the Niter; because the oyly substance of the Brimstone is dryer than the Niter, and because that the Niter can scarce ever be well deflegmated: for its Spirits, by reason of their great thinness, are subject to evaporate, and be gone with the flegm; as also, because no Vessel can long contain melted Niter, without breaking or melting. Obs. 12. That the Brimstone purifies the Niter, because that the grosser part of the Brimstone, which has not been a-fire, mingling its self with the melted Niter, hurries along with it to the bottom all the Faeces of the Niter. Obs. 13. That Crystal Mineral is nothing but a Image 47 (page 60) well-purified Niter, that is well devested, 1. Of its Flegm: 2. Of its fix'd Salt: 3. Of its black Faeces, which it had contracted in those Vessels in which Niter is grosly prepared at first; and so you see, unless you filtrate it, and then crystallize it, it is not sufficiently purified. When once it has been crystallized, then you may dissolve it again, and reduce it into a white Crust, which is called Lapis Prunellae. Now the Crystal Mineral loses its flegm, by the melting of the Niter it is devested of; its Smoot by the flagrations of the Brimstone, and by the filtration; and it loses its fix'd Salt by the crystallization. The �se and Virtues: It cools very much, resists Corruption, and is Diuretick: It may be taken inwards, from half a scruple to a drachm; and in a Clyster, from two drachms to half an ounce.   The Niter sulphurated, or the nitrous Salt of Sulphur. TAke four ounces of Flowers of Brimstone, and eight ounces of very fine purified Niter, reduce them into a very fine Powder separately, and then mingle them together. Then pour into a great stone-Pan, a pint of Spirit of Urine, (drawn from fresh Urine, in a Glass-Alimbeck, and Sand-fire;) in the middle of this Pan set a little stone-Pot, upon which set also a little Cup of the same Earth. Page 61  Then begin to make the flagrations of the said Brimstone and Niter together; and for this effect, put a spoonful of these two powders mingled together into the little Cup, then put into them a red-hot Iron, your matter will be immediately in a flame; therefore cover your Pan with a Glass-Bell, whereby you may receive the red Vapours of the flaming matter. These Vapours will dissolve into three different Substances, viz. into Spirits of Niter, and Spirits of Sulphur, which fall together, and are incorporated with the Spirit of Urine in the bottom of the Pan; and into nitrous flowers of Brimstone, which will be found sticking, partly to the sides of the Bell, and partly to the sides of the Pan, and part of them will be spread in form of a Pellicula, or little skin, upon the superficies of the Spirit of Urine. Take notice, That in this first flagration your Cup breaks infallibly, because it is not lined or fenced with any thing that can hinder the Niter from exrcising its activity upon it. In a quarter of an hour, or thereabouts, the Vapours will be passed, and dissolved into the three Substances I have spoken of; which done, break that little reddish skin upon the superficies of the Spirit of Urine; to the end, that in the following flagrations, the Spirit of Urine may be impregnated with the acid Spirits of the Sulphur and Niter, which could not be, if that skin remained entire: then take away your broken Cup, in which you will find a whitish Crust left. After the first flagration, powder this, and put it into a new stone Cup, and it will keep it from breaking, as the Image 48 (page 62) first did. Then put another spoonful of water into this Cup, fire it, and in a word, observe all the circumstances of the Operation already described, continuing it till all your Sulphur and Niter be consumed. This done, take the calcined Faeces of Niter and Brimstone, which remain in the bottom of your Cup, and reduce them into a fine powder, in an Iron Mortar: then mingle them, with all that is contained in your Earthen Pan, taking care to scrape off from the sides, into the Pan, all those Flowers that stick either to the Bell or Pan: Let this stand, and infuse the space of twelve hours; to the end, that the acid of the Niter and Sulphur, may entirely dissolve all the said Faeces and Flowers: filtrate this Dissolution through a brown Paper, over a glass Pan or Dish, and there will remain in the Paper some grey Faeces of the Flowers of Sulphur, which you may throw away. Then begin your second Operation, that is, the deflegmation or evaporation of your Dissolution; To this purpose, put your Dissolution into a Matrass, which must not be luted; because towards the end of the Operation, you are to see what passes in the Vessel: Your Matrass must be shortnecked, to the end the evaporation may be quicker; and it must not be above three quarters full, lest the matter should boil and run over, by breaking the Glass. Set your Matrass upon a Round, in a small Circulatory Fire, hindring all sorts of Coals, either kindled or not, from coming near your Glass, for fear of breaking it. Continue a Page 63 good equal Fire, till you perceive, after a long boiling, a kind of white scum upon your matter; then lessen the Fire, and let your matter evaporate gently, till it be of a clear milky colour, and cease to boil, and make a noise. Then augment the heat, that so in a small time you may evaporate the nitrous red Spirits still remaining: then, if with this augmentation of heat your matter does not boil, take it off from the fire, and pour it very hot into a stone-Pan, stirring and turning your Pan so as to make your liquor congeal, and spread it self all over equally, in the form of a Crust, as white as Alabaster, but as brittle as Glass. This second Operation, thus performed, you must begin a third, which is to mould this Salt into the Figure of Glass-Vials. This third Operation does indeed add nothing to the virtue of the remedy, but is only an ingenious beautifying of it, which is thus performed. Fill little Glass-Vials half full with these white Crusts, place a Vial upon the ground, and surround it with live Coals, the Salt will presently melt: when it is melted, take away your Vial, and shake it, that the Salt may stick to the sides of it, and so take the shape of the Glass; then wet your Vial with cold Water, and it will break into a thousand pieces, which will nevertheless cleave to the Salt. These you must loosen with the point of a knife, and when you have taken away all the bits of Glass, there will remain a Vial of Salt, as white as Alabaster, and which may be so preserved till you need it. Image 49 (page 64)  Obs. 1. That to make the Salt of Brimstone, you must calcine the Brimstone, and that nothing can calcine it so well as Niter, which, by firing the Brimstone, raises its volatile part, or Spirits, and leaves in the Cup the Calx of Brimstone, containing but few Faeces, and a great deal of fixed Salt: and the Niter being pure, burns all away, and remains not in the said Calx; but, because here Niter is the Agent, therefore we use here as much again of it as of Sulphur, which is the Patient. The reddish Flowers of Brimstone are also calcined by the said Niter. Obs. 2. That we use here Spirit of Urine, as well because that if there were no Liquor, the acid Spirits of Niter and Brimstone would be lost in the pores of the earthen Pan, as because that the said Spirit of Urine is a powerful Diuretick, and does therefore augment the virtue of our Remedy. Obs. 3. That the hardest thing in this Operation, is to deflegmate the dissolution of Brimstone in the Spirit of Sulphur, and there is a great deal of danger that the Matrass will break towards the end of your Operation, when the matter rises, and boils high; therefore be diligent, moderate your heat, Experience makes a good Artist. Obs. 4. That after you have happily evaporated your Dissolution, that you may conclude your process, and chuse whether you will mould your Salt into the Figure of Glass-Vials, or no: but pour out your Dissolution into an earthen Dish, and so keep it. Page 65  Obs. 5. That this nitrous Salt of Brimstone, is nothing but the Flowers of Brimstone, calcined by the Salt of Niter, then impregnated with the Spirits of Brimstone and Niter, and at last coagulated into a white Salt. If after the evaporation of the Spirit of Niter, which was incorporated with this Salt, you take of it, and Sal Armoniac, equal parts, and sublime them together, you will have a lovely sublim'd Salt, white, and so strong, that it will melt in Paper, and break a Box, if you put it into it. Its �se and Vertues: 'Tis a powerful cooler, and Diuretick, it purifies the Blood, resists Corruption, is most excellent in Feavers, both continual, and intermittent; it drives the Gravel of the Kidneys, and cures the Running of the Reins; the Dose is, from ten to thirty Grains, in Wine, Broth, Syrop, Ptisane, Distilled Water, or Decoction, answerable to the Indication, and sometimes in a Purgative Powder, or Bolus.   Dulcified Sublimate. TAke of good Corrosive Sublimate of Venice, as much as you please, eight ounces if you will; powder it to a fine Powder, in a white earthen Dish, pretty deep, and very even, with a glass or earthen Pestle, and be careful to stop your Nose with a Handkerchief, tyed behind your Head, for fear the vapours of the Image 50 (page 66) Sublimate, should make your Head ake, or cause some worse effect. Then put to it the same weight of Quicksilver, and by trituration, or beating, incorporate them together: when they are half incorporated, add to them a spoonful of distilled Vinegar, or rather just as much as is necessary to reduce your Mass into a wet powder, and not into a paste; if you put too much Vinegar, you will have the trouble afterwards of evaporating it by the fire side, and then all the purgative vertue of the Mercury will go near to fly away, with the superfluous humidity of the distilled Vinegar. Put this powder into a small Matrass, long and straight-necked, and unluted, that you may see to the bottom; let a good part of the Matrass be empty, that there may be room for the sublimation, and that it may be performed in a shorter time with a small heat; pose your Matrass upon a Round, in the small circulary Fire, and presently you will perceive some humid vapours, which rise from the Vinegar: and when they cease, then 'tis a sign that all the Vinegar is evaporated: then stop your Matrass with a Paper-stopple, the better to keep in the Spirits of the Mercury, and the Salts of the Sublimate Corrosive: continue your Fire equally, till all the matter be raised, and sublimed from the bottom of the Vessel; then your first Sublimation is perfected: therefore take off your Matrass, let it cool, and then break it below the Sublimate; take out the said Sublimate, which will be all in a lump, like a Mushrome, and of a Pearl-colour; separating the Quicksilver, Page 67 if any, which you shall find swimming on the top, and which has not been well incorporated with the rest; if there be any spot of blackness about it, you must also scrape it with a Knife gently; and above all, you must take out by inclination, that is, by pouring the Quicksilver that will be got, as high as the orifice of the Matrass; as also, scrape away a kind of greyish powder, which will be in good quantity in the neck of your Matrass: set aside this scraping, and this powder, to use it in those Unguents, in which Mercury is required: because, this black scraping would in a second Sublimation, stain the whiteness of your Sublimate; and the greyish powder, would communicate a venomous quality to the remedy, because in it are enclosed the sulphureous Volatil, yellow Salts, as well of the Mercury, as of the Corrosive Sublimate; and it is in these Volatil Salts, that consists all the malignity of the Sublimate. This done, reduce your Pearl-colour Sublimate into powder, in a stone or marble Morter, and put it into a great Matrass, luted from the bottom to half the belly; so that there be five parts left empty, for the Sublimate to stick to; set it in the same Furnace, encreasing the heat by little and little, and taking care to keep off from the Matrass all flaming Coals, lest they should break the Glass: continue this heat, till, when you take off your glass, and shake it, you perceive that little or nothing falls to the bottom. And take notice, That it is better that there should remain something, than that all should be sublim'd; Image 51 (page 68) else your Sublimate being over-heated, would contract a yellowness. Thus your second Operation is ended, take off your Matrass, let it cool, and then break it below the Sublimate (which now is call'd the White Eagle) it appears in form of a Crown, towards the middle of the Matrass. Take out your Sublimate, and separate it carefully from all its Faeces, which are a red Earth, proceeding from the Vitriol, and which sticks to the bottom of the Sublimate, and also a grey powder, coming from the volatil, and venomous Salts of the Mercury, and the Sublimate Corrosive: it sticks to the orifice and neck of the Matrass. Use them both in Unguents, as it has been said if you chuse not rather to revive all the Mercury that is in them, and make it quick again, for this same, or some other Operation. Keep this Sublimate in a glass Vial of a large orifice, and put it in, in pretty big morsels; stop it well with a Cork, and a piece of oyl'd Bladder over it, for fear it lose at last its purgative Vertue, by the evaporation of its best volatil, white mercurial Salt. It is not good to sublime it a third time, lest it lose all its purgative Vertue; nay, the more you would sublime it now, the blacker it would grow: so that, after five or six sublimations, it would turn in the bottom of the Glass into a black lump, without possibility of being sublimed any more. Obs. 1. That the Corrosive Sublimate ought to be made with Quicksilver, Common Salt, Vitriol, and Saltpeter: they make it rarely well at Page 69 Venice, from whence it is brought to us, and sold three times cheaper than we can afford to make it. The Hollanders send good quantities of it hither, but it is ordinarily sophisticated, by the mixtion of white Arsenick, which is very heavy, and but ten pence a pound; whereas Mercury is worth four or five shillings a pound; besides, that Arsenick being incorporated with the Sublimate, is a strong poyson. But you will easily perceive this Cheat, if you pour a little Oyl of Tartar, made per deliquium, upon your Corrosive Sublimate: if it be good, and without mixtion of Arsenick, it will become as yellow as Gold; if there be Arsenick, it will grow as black as Ink. Besides, the best Sublimate of Venice, is made into little Grains, as big as Hempseed: but the Sublimate of Holland, is in great Splinters, as Mineral, Antimony, or Bismuth; and this is, because the Arsenick cannot be so well incorporated with the said Mercury, as common Salt, Niter, and Vitriol. Obs. 2. That we take of Sublimate and Quicksilver equal parts; because, if there were less Corrosive Sublimate, it could not corrode, and calcine the Mercury: and if there were more, it would be hard to dulcifie the Mercury: 'Tis experience has taught us this proportion. Obs. 3. That we make use of a Glass, or white Dish, or Pan, with a glass or marble Pestle, to powder the Corrosive Sublimate: for it would whiten and spoil a brass or iron Mortar: and because in an earthen-glaz'd dish it would be black'd by the Lead of the Dish, and in an un-glaz'd one, Image 52 (page 70) there would much of it be lost in the little pores of the Earth: but all these inconveniences are prevented by making use of a Marble Glass, or Whiteware Dish, which indeed is but the dreggs of Glass, refined and crystallized. Obs. 4. That we use distilled Vinegar to incorporate the Quicksilver, with the Corrosive Sublimate; because, the Vinegar, having a Salt, helps the corrosion of the Mercury; and therefore furthers more their intimate mixtion, than a Liquor which had not such a Salt would do; but undistilled Vinegar, and particularly of Red-wine, is not good, because it would alter the whiteness of this Remedy. The Spirit of Vitriol is worse, for it would make it black: spittle would do well enough, but it is dangerous to spit upon the Sublimate, lest in spitting, some of it should get into the mouth. Obs. 5. That in the first Sublimation, we give but a gentle circulary Fire, and do thereby elevate the Sublimate, but a little above the bottom of the Matrass; because, we do not pretend at this time to any thing, but only to calcine, and incorporate the Mercury with the Sublimate. But in the second Sublimation we give a greater Fire, and raise the Sublimate to the middle of the Matrass; because then we desire to purifie exactly our Sublimate from its Faeces, and by evaporating the malignant venomous volatil Salts, have a fair crystallized Sublimate. Obs. 6. That if in the second Sublimation, when all your powder is sublim'd, you do not take your Matrass off from the Fire, it will grow Page 71 yellow, and blackish; nay, the more you sublime it, the blacker it will grow; because the Mercury being devested of the purest part of its Salt, who have left behind a sulphureous smoot, begins to burn, change colour, and at last grow black. Obs. 7. That the dulcified Sublimate is but crude Mercury; incorporated with, and calcined by Corrosive Sublimate, then devested of its own, and all the venomous Salts of the Corrosive Sublimate; but yet furnished with the mildest, and sweetest parts of them, and by them. The Vertue Purgative of this Remedy, is, as it were, whited, and sharpened. Now while the Mercury is a calcining, and purifying by these Salts, it rises more or less, according to the heat, by its own nature, which is Volatil, and by the means of the Niter, which is joyned with it. And this we call subliming; for the common Salt, and Vitriol, are hurried away, and carried up by the Mercury and Niter, and by their Nature, which is not Volatil: they keep the Mercury and Niter from rising so high, as to run out of the Matrass. Its �se and Vertues: It purges gently, from one scruple to a dram; and if you take it four days together, augmenting your Doze, by little and little, from a scruple to a dram, it fluxes. Its particular Use is, to dissolve all scirrous, and scorbutick Tumours, both interiour and exteriour.   Image 53 (page 72) Turbith Mineral. TAke two ounces of Quick-silver, well purified, and three ounces of Spirit of Niter; put them into a Glass Retort luted to half the neck, leaving a gap to look through at; place it upon a Round, in a small circulary Furnace, keeping the neck of your Retort streight, and not leaning on one side, till your Mercury be dissolved in the Spirit of Niter, which you will easily perceive through the gap you left, when you luted your Glass. When your Mercury is quite dissolved, then, to go the shorter way to work, evaporate the Spirit of Niter, your Retort being in the same posture still: but if you mean to draw off the said Spirit of Niter, then set your Retort in a distilling posture, and fit to it a Recipient, continuing your fire in the same degree as before. When the exsiccation, or drying of your Mercury shall be thus performed, take off your Vessel, and let it cool; then pour into it an ounce of Oyl of Sulphur, upon the white matter which remains in the bottom, and then set it again upon the same fire, till all the Oyl of Sulphur be likewise evaporated; reiterate three or four times this cohobation, or rectification, with the same proportion of Oyl of Sulphur: to the end, that at last it may fire the Mercury. This done, break your vessel, and in the bottom you will find a white lump, which reduce to powder, and upon this powder pour warm water, Page 73 which incontinent will become yellow: reiterate this dulcoration or sweetning, till at last your water come away as insipid as it was poured on; then separate by inclination the water, which will not be tinged as the other was, and after dry your matter gently in a sand heat, and there will remain at last a powder as yellow as Gold: upon this, pour some spponfuls of Spirit of Wine, and set it on fire, doing thus three or four times to sweeten your Mercury the more. It will be as yellow and as bright as Gold, and of no taste, and so fix, that being put into a Crucible, and melted in a Wine Furnace, it will still keep the consistence of a yellow powder, without losing but very little of its weight, which is a sign that it is well fixt. Obs. 1. That your Mercury for this Operation, must be well purified, because the intention is to fix it, which could scarce be done, if it were impure, and mingled with Lead, besides that being designed for a purgative in a very small Dose, it would scarce answer your intention: you will be able to judge if it be well purified or no, by putting some of it into a Stone-cup: for, if when you put a finger into it, it does not hang, and make a long thred, as a syrup would do, but is short, then it is good. If it be impure, you may purifie it by straining it through the Leather called Chamy; for, the Lead, if there be any, will remain in the leather; or else distill your Mercury in a Glass Retort luted, in a fire of suppression, and the Mercury will remain in the bottom of the Retort. Image 54 (page 74)  Obs. 2. That we use Spirit of Niter, and not Aqua fortis, to dissolve the Mercury, because the said Spirit being less harmful, and corrosive than Aqua fortis, ought to be imployed in all preparations of Remedies that are to be taken inwardly: besides that, if we had employed Aqua fortis, then the Mercury must necessarily after its dissolution have become red, as it shall be taught in the Chapter of the Red Precipitate hereafter: and no other Spirit would be corrosive enough to dissolve the Mercury but Spirit of Niter. Obs. 3. That we use a greater quantity of Spirit of Niter, than of Mercury, because experience teaches us, that the dissolvant must be in greater quantity to dissolve such a dose of Mercury. Obs. 4. That the said dissolution requires no other than a small circulary fire: for, if the heat were greater, the Spirit would evaporate, and be gone, in stead of doing its work; and for the same reason, we keep the Retort with its neck upwards, that so, if the Spirit be raised, yet it may fall down again, and dissolve the Mercury. Obs. 5. That if you draw off by distillation that said Spirit of Niter, it may be useful to you in frictions, for the Itch, the Scab, and such like diseases, having lost its force, which would have consum'd proud flesh, excrescences, &c. Obs. 6. That the Mercury, being dissolved, and calcin'd Philosophically by the Spirit of Niter, after the exsiccation and evaporation of the said Spirit, the Calx of the Mercury is Page 75 white, because the Niter being also white by nature, cannot with a small fire colour any body that is dissolved in it, but the Aqua fortis, makes the bodies grow red, because of the Vitriol which is in it. Obs. 7. That upon the Calx of Mercury, we pour Spirit of Sulphur divers times, that so we may intirely fix the said Mercury, because the spirit of Sulphur is of it self fix, and farr from evaporating, when it is put in a Matrass upon the fire, it fixes part of it into a very pricking sharp Salt: and therefore, this Spirit has power to fix all Metals. The black Spirit of Vitriol, is not proper to fix, because it is of its nature volatil, and would evaporate all away, as for its salt at least; and there would remain nothing but a Caput mortuum: and observe, by the by, that Mercury passes here through two the noblest Operations of Chymistry; for first, it is dissolved by the Spirit of Niter, and then coagulated by the Spirit of Sulphur. Obs. 8. That by pouring warm water upon this calx, it presently grows yellow, because the Oyl of Sulphur has communicated to it the Sulphureous yellow colour; and the water being actually warm, dissolves and extracts the Salts who were incorporated in the said Calx. Obs. 9. That by burning Spirit of Wine over the said Mercury, you dulcifie and sweeten it, and make its purgative vertue gentler; because, the burning Spirit of Wine, penetrating the said Mercury, carries away with it, in the burning, all the Venemous volatil Salt that could be left. Image 55 (page 76)  Obs. 10. That Turbith Mineral is nothing but Mercury dissolved, and calcin'd by the Spirit of Niter, then fixt by the Spirit of Sulphur, then devested of the salts of its dissolvants by reiterated lotions, and freed from its malignous Sulphur by the flagrations of the Spirit of Wine. Its �se and Vertue: It purges strongly, and often provokes Vomit, from three to six grains; it cures the Pox without fluxing, because being fixt, it cannot rise to the mouth, as all other preparations of Mercury that have not been fixt do. It is nevertheless very violent, because it is not so fixt, but there yet remains a little un-fixt mercurial Salt, and Sulphur, who are sharpened by the Spirits of Niter and Brimstone: and indeed, if all of it were fixt, then nothing of it could be dissolved in the stomach, and so would produce no other effect, than as much Gold in powder; also, being not altogether Volatil, its Vertue is less harmful.   The White Precipitate. TAke of pure Mercury eight ounces, and of Aqua fortis sixteen, put them into an unluted long necked Matrass, and of such a size, as it be not half full, lest when the Mercury and Aqua fortis are in dissolution, there should be so great an ebullition, as to cause the matter to run Page 77 over: stir a little your Matrass with your hands, to heat the Aqua fortis, then set your vessel on warm ashes, to help a little more your Aqua fortis in its action upon the Mercury: but have a care you give not a greater heat than is necessary for a gentle ebullition; for, if your Aqua fortis be over-heated, and opened, it will tinge (by the means of its Vitriol) your Mercury in a yellow colour: as soon as your Mercury is entirely dissolved, which may be done in half an hour, pour your dissolution into an earthen Stone Pan, or glass Bell (the glazed earth being unfit, because the Aqua fortis would dissolve the Vernish) then pour upon your matter cold sea-water, well filtrated, and impregnated with common Salt undecrepitated; you may use about a quart of this Water, till your dissolved Mercury be all precipitated to the bottom of your Vessel, in a white powder. And take notice, that if you had used common water, you would not have precipitated your Mercury, but turned your dissolution into a white Liquor, which would have discharged it self of a white sharp powder: because that common water, having no salt, cannot fight with the salts of the Aqua fortis; but if it be impregnated with a contrary salt, there arises a conflict, during which the Mercury scrapes, and falls to the bottom, leaving behind him a good part of his salts. This done, separate by Inclination your sea-water, and pour a great quantity of common water upon your matter, to take away the Acrimony, which the Aqua fortis by its Niter and Vitriol has communicated to the Mercury, Image 56 (page 78) and continue this, till your water come off insipid. Then, having pour'd off your last water, filtrate the remainder in a brown, or rather white Paper, to preserve the colour; and dry your Precipitate in the shade: for, if you do it in the Sun, or by the Fire, it will lose much of its whiteness; when it is very dry, keep it in a close Vial, well stopped, and covered with an oyl'd Bladder. Obs. 1. That though this Remedy be taken inwards, yet we use Aqua fortis, and not Spirit of Niter; because, Aqua fortis costs less, and is sooner made than Spirit of Niter; which undoubtedly, without this reason of sparing, would be much fitter for this Operation: yet, we think that the great Lotions that are made, do dulcifie it, as if it had been prepared with Spirit of Niter. Obs. 2. That we take as much again of Aqua fortis as of Niter; as well, because the dissolvant must be stronger than the thing dissolv'd, as because that Experience teaches, that such a Dose of Aqua fortis is necessary to dissolve the Mercury entirely. Obs. 3. That the Matrass must be long necked, that the Aqua fortis rais'd by the heat, to the middle of the neck, may cool, be condensed, and fall down again; for, in this Operation, we pretend to nothing, but to dissolve and calcine Philosophically, and lightly, the Mercury, without penetrating its Body, and opening it by the Salts of the Aqua fortis, as we mean to do in the Red Precipitate: and thence it comes, that this Mercury, after its precipitation, retains its white colour, and the nature of Quicksilver. Page 79  Obs. 4. That if you pour hot Sea-water on your Dissolutions, then you will not be able to precipitate entirely your Mercury; because, that the salt Sea-water, being sharpened by an actual heat, would penetrate and dissolve a part of the said Mercury, in stead of precipitating it. Obs. 5. That to make Sea-water, you must not take decrepitated Salt; because, it would be to no end to take away the flegm, since you are to put it into Water; and as for purifying it, filtration will do that. Obs. 6. That the White Precipitate, is nothing but Mercury opened, and calcined by the Aqua fortis, and retaining but very little of the Salts of the said Aqua fortis, the rest being carried away by the dulcorations. Its �se and Vertue: It is the gentlest of all the Purgatives drawn from Mercury, though it be dissolved by Aqua fortis; because it has been sweetned by Lotions: It purges nevertheless more violently than the sweet Sublimate, and its Dose is less: For, to Children it is from three to six Grains, and for Aged persons, it is from six to fifteen: It cures the Pox taken interiourly; and being dissolved with Oyl, it may be exteriourly used by Frictions, to cure the Itch, &c. This Remedy fluxes as easily as the sweet Sublimate; because, the Mercury being unfix'd in these Preparations, has his wings left him, wherewith he presently flies upwards, in stead of purging by Stools.   Image 57 (page 80) The Red Precipitate of Mercury. PUt four ounces of good Quicksilver, and six ounces of Aqua fortis into a Matrass, luted from its bottom to half the belly: set your Matrass on a Round, in a small circulary Fire; give a gentle heat at first, lest you should cause too great an ebullition; then encrease it, by little and little, till your Aqua fortis be evaporated; and you will know if your Aqua fortis be evaporated, by laying upon the mouth of your Matrass a piece of Brass, or any other Metal: for, if it be not wet, then it is a sign that all the humidity, proceeding from the Aqua fortis, is evaporated: then encrease the Fire, putting live Coals round about the Glass, as high as the Lute goes, and continue the Fire, till your Mercury rise upon the brim of the Matrass, in form of a yellow Soot, and that a piece of yellow Metal set over this vapour, do grow white by rubbing of it; and that is a sign that the Operation is ended: therefore take off your Glass with all speed, else your Mercury would all vanish away in this smoak. Your Matrass being cold, must be broken a little above the matter, and you shall find in the bottom an Orange-colour lump, the same in weight as the crude Mercury you used at first: and this is it, which we call a Red Precipitate. Obs. 1. That if perchance the middle of this lump were of a whitish colour, then that is a sign that the Operation is not perfect; and therefore, you Page 81 must reduce it to powder in an Iron Mortar, and reverberate it in a Crucible, with a Fire of Suppression, till it become right Orange-colour. Obs. 2. That you must not give the Fire so long, till your lump be red; because, than your Mercury would lose all its corrosive Salts, and therefore would be disabled from consuming proud flesh, which is its principal Vertue. Obs. 3. That we use here Aqua fortis to calcine Mercury, because the Remedy which we intend is a Topick exteriour one, to corrode, and consume all superfluous fleshly Excrescences; and it is necessary, that it should be in greater quantity, than the Mercury, to dissolve it entirely. Moreover, calcin'd Mercury does not retain its natural whiteness; because, the Vitriol of the Aqua fortis communicates this tincture, and because that the Fire here, is much more violent, than that which is us'd in the preparation of the Remedy, call'd Turbith Mineral. The dissolvant being also much more over-heated, and penetrating by the help of the Fire, communicates a sulphureous colour. Obs. 4. That the Precipitate is found to be equal in weight to the Mercury, that was dissolved; because, though in this Operation it have lost something of its volatil part, yet it hath impregnated it self with some of the Salts of the Aqua fortis, as much as to make up the weight: and these Salts it will keep, till it be reviv'd, and made Cuicksilver again. Obs. 5. That the Red Precipitate of Mercury Image 58 (page 82) is a Mercury dissolv'd, and calcin'd by Aqua fortis, and then charg'd with the sharpest part of the Salts of the said Aqua fortis. Its �se and Vertue: It is lightly caustick, and escarotick, or consumptive; and therefore eats away all proud flesh, and excrescences: and to mollifie it a little, it is mingled with some Unguent; as the Basilicum, &c. It is good to cleanse Ulcers; it is useful likewise in the preparation of the Arcanum Corallinum.   Arcanum Corallinum. PUt as much Red Precipitate as you please into a glass Bell, pour upon it a good quantity of warm Water, not too hot, for fear of breaking your Vessel; and do this often, till at last your Water come away sweet and insipid; then having poured off your last Water, put your Precipitate into a little glass Cucurbite, and twice as much Spirit of Salt in weight, as there is Precipitate; set your Cucurbite in a Sand-fire, with its Head and glass Receiver fitted to it, to draw off by distillation the flegm of the Spirit of Salt: in the mean time, the volatil Salt of the common Salt, which composes the Spirit of Salt, will remain in the bottom, and be incorporated with the Precipitate of Mercury, and so fix it, as to make it able to endure a reverberatory Fire, without evaporation; on the top of this Mercury there is a white Crust, which is the grossest part of the Page 83 Spirit of Salt that is corporified. Pour upon all this, some cold Water (as soon as your vessel is cool) to the end you may dissolve this grosser Salt, and draw it off from the Mercury; reiterating thus your Lotions, till your Water come off insipid: then put your Mercury (which is of a dark yellow) into a Crucible, and reverberate it in a small reverberatory Furnace, till it become as red as Corral: and in this reverberation, the Salts of the common Salt, which were incorporated in the Mercury, do evaporate, and leave the Mercury in the same weight it had before its first Lotion: and nevertheless, the Mercury is fix'd by that little of these Salts which it enjoys. This done, put the said Mercury into a Dish of Earth glazed, and pour upon it good Spirit of Wine, two or three Fingers deep, which set on fire, till it be consumed, and so reiterate once more the said Flagration, to the end that the purgative, and vomitive Vertues of the Mercury, be milder by the evaporation of the volatil, and venomous part of the said Mercury, and its Salts. Obs. 1. That we wash the Red Precipitate with luke-warm Water, to the end, that all the sharp Salts that are in the said Precipitate, be dissolv'd the better; and by these reiterated Lotions, it becomes at last as sweet, as if it had been prepar'd with Spirit of Niter, in stead of Aqua fortis. Obs. 2. That the Spirit of Salt, as well as the Spirit of Sulphur, has the vertue of fixing Mercury; because, the Mercury it self too is naturally fix'd; being therefore opened, and intimately penetrated Image 59 (page 84) by the Spirit of Salt, the said Spirit communicates to it its fixative vertue, and is it self fixed in the Mercury. And observe, that the Spirit of Salt has un-dyed the Red Precipitate, and made it of a dark yellow; because the common Salt, being by its nature all white, and coming to mingle with the Orange-colour, must needs clear it, and give it this yellow. Obs. 3. That the Arcanum Corallinum, is nothing but Mercury calcin'd and dissolv'd Philosophically by Aqua fortis, then fix'd by Spirit of Salt, and devested by washings, from the most malignous part of its Salts, and of the volatilest part of its substance, by reiterated flagrations of Spirit of Wine. Its �se and Vertue: It purges, and sometimes procures a Vomit, gently opening, and unstopping at the same time the passages, and dissolving all the hardnesses of the schirrous parts: alone it cures the Pox, without fluxing, because it is fix'd: The Dose is, from three to six grains.   The Crocus Metallorum, or Liver of Antimony. TAke of Female Antimony one pound, and half a pound of common impure Niter; powder them, and mingle them together; in the mean time heat red-hot upon two Bricks, in a great Fire of Suppression, a large and capacious Crucible, or Camion: throw into this, with a Page 85 great Iron Ladle, a quantity of your matter, and cover presently your Crucible, keeping it covered, till all the smoak cease: continue this Projection, and Flagration, till all your matter be consumed. This done, encrease the Fire, and stir with a stick your matter continually, till it be all melted: then take it off from the Fire, and pour it into a Brass or Iron Mortar, hindring as much as you can the Faeces, which swim upon the top, from going into the Mortar; this liquor will congeal into a lump, which, when it is cold, you may break into many pieces, as glistring, and shining as Steel, or as burn'd Liver: then, if you powder them, they will change into a Saffron-colour'd powder, not unlike a diseas'd bilious Liver: and thence it is call'd the Saffron of Metals. As for the Faeces, remaining in the Crucible, you must throw them away as useless. Obs. 1. That you must take Female Antimony, as being the worst, and you may know it, by its long bright white Needles; as also, because it is much more brittle, than either the Male or Mineral Antimony. The Male is better than the Female, and is known by its little blue, yellow, green Needles, diversified in colours like a Rainbow. The Mineral Antimony is worst of all, because, not having been melted, it has not lost any of its volatil substance, in which consists all its malignity. It is distinguished easily; for, it is full of the Rock out of which it is drawn. When you melt Mineral Antimony, the Male goes to the bottom. In this Operation of the Crocus Metallorum, Female Antimony is good enough; because, Image 60 (page 86) the Remedy resulting from it is none of the best of Chymistry; you may use the Male if you will, but have a care you do not use the Mineral; because, being loaded with Earth and Rock, it would not melt with so small a quantity of Niter. Obs. 2. That you must take common Niter, not purified, but such as comes from the first washing; because, it is good enough to put the Antimony in fusion; and because, its Faeces being to be mingled with the Faeces of the said Antimony in the melting, it would have been superfluous to have purified the Niter before-hand; yet, if you will be at the charge, purified Niter will do no harm, it will rather be better. Obs. 3. That you must powder your Antimony, and Niter, and mingle them well together; that so, they may the easilier take fire. Obs. 4. That you must not use a glaz'd Pot, or Crucible, lest the enflamed matter should corrode, and melt the Lead of the Pot. Obs. 5. That you must not throw your matter into your Crucible, till it be red-hot, else your Niter would not take fire, and so would not be able to put your Antimony in fusion. Obs. 6. That you must not throw all your matter at a time into the Crucible; for then, the fusion of your Antimony would not be well performed; because, the Niter by so great a flagration, would exhale, and be gone, before it had melted the Antimony. Obs. 7. That after every Projection, you must cover your Crucible very close, to the end you Page 87 may keep in the enflamed vapours of the Niter, who by their circulations, do the better contribute to the melting of the Antimony. Obs. 8. That after all your matter is consumed, yet you must encrease the fire, because the Antimony is but half melted by the said flagrations: but, being already opened by the Niter, it soon melts, if the fire be encreased: and in the mean time, you stir it well, that so the Antimonial Liquor may go to the bottom, and be free from its Faeces; and therefore, we use a stick, and not any thing of Iron, because the said Liquor would corrode the Iron, as we may perceive in the Regulus of Mars; where the Antimony dissolves, and eats the filings of Iron, that are added to it. Besides, you may freely put the said stick to the bottom of your Crucible, because you do not mean to hinder the Faeces of the Antimony from going to the bottom; and therefore, both melting together, descend likewise together, and only the Faeces of the Niter swim on the top of the melted Antimony. Obs. 9. That the Liver of Antimony, or Crocus Metallorum, is nothing but Antimony opened, and melted by Niter, and not devested of its terrestreity, but full of its malignant purgative, and vomitive Sulphur: therefore, we have used but half the quantity of Niter, to a double proportion of Antimony, and we have let it stand no longer upon the Fire, than was necessary to melt it, with the fixt Salt of the Niter remaining in the Crucible. Its �se and Vertues: We seldom or never use Image 61 (page 88) the Liver of Antimony, till we have made it Crocus metallorum, by pulverisation. It is a Moderate vomitive, betwixt violent and gentle, and purges too, at the same time. This powder serves ordinarily to make the Vinum emeticum, or emetick Wine, by putting one ounce of it to infuse in a quart of white Wine, Sack, Beer, Cider, &c. the Dosis of this drink, will be from one to two ounces, to take at the mouth; and from four to six ounces, in an emollient decoction, in a Clyster, without dissolving in it any thing else.   The Regule of Antimony. TAke three pound of male Antimony, one pound and a half of common Niter, one pound and a half of Tartar, and four ounces of Wood Coals; in the mean time, heat red hot a great Crucible, in a great circulary fire of suppression, then throw in your matter by parcels, with an Iron or wooden-ladle, and cover your Pot, or Crucible, at every time, till the smoak be past; then, when your Crucible is almost full, encrease your fire, and with a stick, stir your matter from time to time, that so the purest part of the Antimony, may go to the bottom; but, do not put your stick to the bottom of the pot, lest the Regule, which is in the bottom, should be mingled with Page 89 its Faeces that swim on the top; continue doing thus, till all your matter be melted, which will be in half an hour or thereabouts. Then, if you have any of your first matter left, for which there was not room in the Crucible, you may make an end of it, and put it to this, observing the same circumstances: when all is melted, give a violent fire for a quarter of an hour; to the end, that the most harmful part of the Antimony may exhale. After this, take off your Crucible, set it upon a hot brick, for a cold one would go near to break it, because of its humidity: your Crucible being cold, break it, with a hammer, and in the bottom you will find your Regulus congealed in a lump, of the proportion of the bottom of the pot, as white as silver, very smooth underneath, and sometimes starred above in its superficies: on the top of this Silvery lump are the grayish Faeces, dry and spongious, and in good quantity, and marked also with the Star: but when the Star fails, the Regulus is as good, as if it had not fail'd; for the Star is produced, but by a long fusion, which straightning it, does also diminish something of its purgative, and emetick vertues, by the too great evaporation of the flowers, and volatil Salt of the said Antimony. Obs. 1. That you must preserve the Faeces of your Regulus; for out of it you must draw the Golden Diaphoretick Sulphur, as shall be said hereafter. Obs. 2. That we use here the Male Antimony Image 62 (page 90) as best, because here we aim at a more excellent remedy, than the Crocus Metallorum. Obs. 3. That we use here common Niter unpurified, for the reason alleadged in the Chapter of the Liver of Antimony. Obs. 4. That we here make use of Niter to open and set in fusion the body of Antimony, though we do also imploy the Tartar to hinder a too great ebullition of the said Antimony, because, the Niter being somewhat busie in calcining the Tartar, cannot employ all its force upon the Antimony; besides, the Tartar being not inflameable by its nature, hinders the Niter from causing this ebullition; and being withall a gentle Salt, it purifies, cleanses, and whitens the Antimony. Then we use Wood-Coals in powder for the same end, and because also the Coals being spongious, are apt to draw to themselves, and retain the Faeces of the Antimony. Now it is very necessary in this Operation, to prevent the ebullition, lest the Antimony should run over the pot, and be lost, we use also but one proportion of Niter to two of Antimony, for fear the flagration should be too quick, and we keep all the matter longer upon the fire than we do the Crocus metallorum, to give the Regulus time to separate from its Faeces. Obs. 5. That you must powder, and mingle together the said matters; that you must not make use of a glazed pot; that you must not put in your matter, till your pot be red hot: that you must not put it in all at a time, but by little and little; and that presently after every projection, Page 91 you must cover the Pot with its cover: That you must stir your matter with a stick, for the reasons alledged in our observations upon the Liver of Antimony. Obs. 6. That the Regulus of Antimony is nothing but an Antimony opened, and melted by the Niter, somewhat more intimately, than the Liver of Antimony; because of the addition that is made here of the Tartar and Charcoal; and also, by reason of the continuation of the fire, which devests it of its terrestreity, and of a good part of its venomous Sulphur, and flowers: but yet it is endowed with a great emetick, and purgative vertue. Therefore we have not used here much Niter; and though the fire has been more violent than in the Liver of Antimony, yet it has not been strong enough to banish all the vomitive and purgative vertue, as shall be done in the Diaphoretick Antimony. The Vertues and �se: It is a milder vomative, and a gentler purgative, than the Crocus metallorum: and it is used in three different ways. 1. It may be powder'd and infus'd, and so make a Vinum emeticum, as has been said in the Crocus metallorum. 2. We make of it eternal Pills. 3. We make Cups of it, in which Wine infus'd, becomes purgative, and emetick. 4. It serves also to make the Diaphoretick, by calcining it with Niter, either in a fire of suppression, or in the Sun-beams by a burning-glass. To make the everlasting Pills, you must have a Mould for leaden Bullets, of the bigness of an ordinary pill: lute, with our Lute, the lower Image 63 (page 92) parts, and all the sides of your Mould, to the end that your melted liquor being thereby kept in, may be fitly and handsomly shaped into the form of Pills; then take as much as you please of your Regulus, and put it into an iron melting spoon, with a long handle: which set, upon a great fire of suppression, or in a wind Furnace: cover the said spoon with a dry Tyle, not a wet one, lest it should fly, then pour coals upon your spoon, thus covered, and give a melting fire, till your matter be red hot, and perfectly melted, and as shining and bright as quicksilver; then pour gently your matter into your mould, and when it is cold, take out your Pills, which stick all one to another; separate them; and with a knife even them so, as they may have no unequal parts, which might hurt the throat, esophage the Maw, the Guts, or the Fundament. One of these Pills may serve you for ever, taking it out of the close-stool; and then making it clean for another time: for one Pill of dragm has the same effect, as the ordinary dose of Vinum emeticum, and works as well, as if you took three or four of these Pills at a time. As for the mould of the Cup, it must be of sand and can serve you but once: your Cup must be as thick as a Crown piece: you must make your addresses to those that cast Bells, to make you a mould: you may make one of Brass, but it will cost you too much, and yet will not do so well as one of sand.   Page 93 The Regulus of Mars. TAke two pound of Male Antimony, one pound of Tartar, and as much of Common Niter, two ounces of Charcoal, and six ounces of filings of steel, or iron, powder all these, and mingle them well together, and operate in the same manner, as you did in making the Regulus of Antimony. The Operation done, will produce you thirteen ounces of Regulus, proceeding from Seven ounces of Antimony, and six of filings; whereby you may perceive, that the Antimony loses much of its smooty Sulphur, and its sulphureous malignant flowers. Obs. 1. That we add here the filings, to the end we may fix the vomative quality of Antimony, but you must not put above three ounces to each pound of Antimony, lest it should be so fixt, as to lose its purgative vertue, and contract the nature of a metal. Obs. 2. That we employ, not so much Charcoal in this Regulus of Mars, as in the precedent Regulus of Antimony, in recompense whereof we put the filings, which produce the same effect. Obs. 3. That out of the Faeces of this Regulus, is also made the golden Diaphoretick Sulphur. Obs. 4. That the Regulus of Mars, is nothing but Antimony perfectly opened by Niter, and devested of its venemous qualities by a long fusion, though not long enough, to evaporate, Image 64 (page 94) all its purgative Sulphur. Its Emetick vertue is fixt, by the Addition of Mars. Its �se and Vertue: It purges gently by stool without provoking to vomit; if it be infused in white Wine, or if you make of it everlasting Pills, or Cups, in the same dosis and methods we have described in the Regulus of Antimony. Nay more, if you powder one pound of it, and tye it up loosely in a coorse linnen, and then let it infuse in a quart of the decoction of sudorifick Woods, and Roots, you may cure the Pox without fluxing by Mercurial remedies. There is also made with the Regulus of Antimony, and Niter calcin'd together, an excellent Diaphoretick Antimony; but observe, that that which is made, either with crude Antimony, or with the Regulus of Antimony, provokes vomiting, except it be very well washed; whereas that which is made with the Regulus of Mars, never incites to vomit.   The golden Diaphoretick Sulphur. TAke of the Faeces of Regulus Antimony, or of the Regulus of Mars, and boil them a quarter of an hour in common water, in a Brass kettle, to make thereof a dark yellow Lexivium, which filtrate through a brown Paper. Gather together all your filtrations, and put them into a glass, or stone vessel, but not into a glazed earthen Page 95 then one; lest the Salts of your matter, should corrode the Lead, or Vernish, and so black your powder; then pour upon them two or three spoonfuls of Vinegar, or Spirit of Niter, Vitriol, or Sulphur, or some other acid; the stronger it is, the higher will be the colour of your Precipitate; for, these acid Spirits do much more vivifie colours, than Vinegar does. You will see presently, that your Faeces will curdle, become yellowish, and stink; your Curd being setled, pour away the Liquor, which you may keep to wash your Bedsteds withal, to keep them clean from Punaises: then upon your Curds, throw common Water; and you shall see them precipitate into a powder of a Saffron-colour. Pour away this first Water, and pour on some more, in great quantity, that you may at once sweeten your powder, and take away from it its ill smell, and its emetick vertue; then having poured away this last Water, filtrate the residue through a brown Paper, in which let it dry at leisure in the shade. Obs. 1. That the Faeces of both these Reguluses, do contain a Sulphureous smoot of Antimony, and a fix'd Salt of Niter and Tartar: therefore common Water is easily impregnated therewith by ebullition. Obs. 2. That the Acid, which you pour upon the said Lexivium filtrated, produces three different effects; of which the first is, To separate the sulphureous and saltish Smoot, from the common Water, and so it appears in Curds. The second is, To give a gross yellow colour to the Image 65 (page 96) Curds and Water. The third is, To make the said Curds and Water stink abominably. It produces the first effect; because, that the Antimonial Sulphur, dissolved by a saltish and lexivial dissolvant, remains incorporated with him, till you pour in a little of a salinous Precipitant; which being of a different nature to the dissolvant, it happens that these two Salts, thus mingled, begin to whet one another, and by their action, and re-action, cause an ebullition, evaporation, and dissipation of the sharpest part of the dissolvant. So that growing weak, he is forced to let go his hold, and suffer the body he had seized upon, to fall away to the bottom of the Vessel. The Acid produces the second effect; because all Acids do enliven, and enlighten colours; now the colour of Sulphur is yellow, from whence it comes, that this Antimonial Sulphur, which in its dissolution was of a dark yellow, in its precipitation, becomes now of a fine light yellow. Now all salinous Spirits, do vivifie colours, because, they are of a detergent nature, and do cleanse, and take away all the greasie, obscure smoot, which did darken the lustre of the natural colour, as linnen grows white and clean by bucking. The Acid produces the third effect; because Sulphur, when it is heated, is naturally stinking; now it is heated by the action of the Precipitant, and re-action of the Dissolvant: This may be observed in the hot waters of Mineral Baths, which stink extreamly of Sulphur; because a bituminous and a sulphureous spring, happening to joyn with a nitrous, and vitriolous spring, Page 97 do whet, and heat one another, and so produce the sulphureous smell. Obs. 3. That if you pour a good quantity of common VVater upon these Curds, that presently they are precipitated into a yellow powder; because, the said VVater dissolves all the Salts that remained in the said Curds; so that then the Antimonial Sulphur, being free from all tyes and bonds, precipitates it self into a powder of a much livelier colour, than that of the Curds: because, now the Sulphur has thrown off the Salts, and appears under its own natural colour of Sulphur. Obs. 4. That the golden Diaphoretick Sulphur, is nothing but a fix'd Sulphur of Antimony, drawn from the Faeces of Antimony, opened and melted by Niter: for, the volatil Sulphur of Antimony is so much the more venomous, as it is volatil; and that which is least volatil, is violently vomitive and purgative: but, this being fix'd, is only diaphoretick and opening: and for a proof that the said Diaphoretick Sulphur is but a fix'd Sulphur of Antimony, do but let the said Faeces of the Regulus of Antimony lye two or three days upon the ground, and there will rise of it self, without any Artifice, a kind of a yellow Moss all over your Faeces, which is nothing but the true Sulphur of Antimony purified. Its �se and Vertue: It is a powerful Diuretick and Diaphoretick, it serves principally to provoke the Monthly Courses of Women, being taken in the weight of twenty or thirty Grains, either alone, or with Saffron, Savin, and Sene, Image 66 (page 98) of each ten or twelve Grains, infusing them twelve hours in White-wine, and so continuing for two or three days together; to the same end, may be received by a Tunnel, the vapour of the Lexivium of the said Faeces, before their precipitation into Curds. And take notice here, that if the said Powder have not been carefully wash'd and sweetned, that it may chance to purge, and provoke vomit too.   The Diaphoretick Antimony, or the Diaphoretick Mineral. TAke one pound of Male Antimony, or of the Regule of Antimony, or of the Regulus of Mars, and four pound of pure Salt-peter; powder them very fine, and searce your Antimony through a Silk Sieve; then mingle them together, to the end the Niter may well inflame the Antimony; in the mean time, set a Camion, or great Crucible upon a Round, in a great circulatory Fire; when your Crucible is red-hot, then with a wooden Ladle, throw in a Ladle full of your matter, cover your Pot to keep in the smoak; which being past, do as at first, and put in another Ladle full, so continuing, till you have consumed all your matter; then continue the Fire, taking off the cover from your Crucible, till there come out no more vapours, which will be in half an hours time; after which, take off your Crucible: for, if you did let it stand any longer, your matter would become a Page 99 red Liquor, which being cold, would settle in a lump, like the Liver of Antimony, and would have the same Vertues, because the excessive heat would have opened its body a-fresh: then, take out your matter by Ladle-fulls, with a Tin Ladle, and throw it as hot as you can, into a great stone Pan, full of cold Water; and do not throw it in of a sudden, lest some of the matter should sparkle upon your hands and face; but dip in your Ladle by little and little; when you have done all your matter, then wash your hands, and with them stir and break the said matter, precipitated to the bottom, till the Water become as white as Milk, and your matter as small as you can make it. Separate by Inclination the said milky Water from its Faeces, who are a fix'd Niter, undissolvable in Water, and which you may throw away: Let this milky Water stand three or four hours, to the end, that all your white powder may precipitate to the bottom; then separate by Inclination this Water, which will be good for the Itch: then pour on more Water, and do so, till it come away insipid. Having poured off the last Water, there will remain a kind of white Pap, which put into a Coffin of white Paper, over a glass or earthen Vesica, so all the Water will run into the Vesica, and there will remain a white lump, which you must dry leisurely in the shade, upon the bottom of a Sieve. Being very dry, and in little white brittle pieces, you may keep them so, or powder them, and put them into a glass Vial, well stopped. If you desire to reduce this Magistery into Trochishs, you may do thus. When Image 67 (page 100) it is yet Pap, put it into a glass Tunnel, and stop the bottom of it with your finger, till your matter be setled; then let go your finger, and let your matter drop out, in drops, upon a Marble, and so it will be formed into Trochisks; dry them in the shade, and not in the Sun: for, the reverberation of its beams, would alter the white colour, which is the beauty of these Remedies: all Magisteries may be trochiskated in the same way, and then must be kept in a glass Vial well stop'd. Obs. 1. That in this Composition, we make use of Male Antimony, rather than of the Female; because, being heavier, it is better; and for the same reason we use the Regulus of Antimony, and rather the Regulus of Mars, because it is already more purified of the venomous part of its volatil substance. Now in this Remedy we do pretend, that all that part of the Antimony which has been opened by the Niter, is absolutely devested of its purgative and emetick substance, that is, of all its volatil Salt, and Sulphur: therefore we ought not to use the Female Antimony, which has more of this volatil substance than the Male. But the Regulus of Antimony is better; because, as it is devested, as well of a considerable part of its volatil substance, as of its terrestreity, it is fitter to be purified, and entirely refin'd from all its malignous qualities: and yet the Regulus of Mars is best of all; because, in it the emetick Vertue is already fixed by Mars, incorporated with the Antimony. You must also take notice, That they that seek the Philosophers Page 101 Stone in Antimony, prefer Mineral Antimony before all others, thinking, that because it has not been melted, it is impregnated with all its vertue; and therefore ought to be used also in this Operation: but without diving any further in this Well of Democritus, I will only say, That for the use of Physick, Mineral Antimony is the most malignant of all, and it is devested of these ill qualities, only by long and reiterated fusions and evaporations. Obs. 2. That we use here very fine Niter, because we are not only to open, and melt the Antimony (for common Niter would do that) but also so to penetrate the Antimony, as to cause an evaporation of all its volatil, purgative, and emetick substance. Now common Niter cannot do this, because, having a terrestrious substance, and a fix'd Salt in it self, it would not be fit to maintain a long and penetrating fusion. Obs. 3. That for the same reason we put three times as much Niter upon the said Dosis of Antimony, and for the same reason we keep the Antimony, and the Niter upon the Fire half an hour after their Flagration and Projection, till all the smoak be vanished, and with it, the emetick and purgative qualities, which the Niter had opened, and set loose in the Antimony: but, if after that, you continue your Fire, it will produce the same effect in the Antimony, that the Niter did; that is, it will discover, and bring forth a new emetick, and purgative vertue, as we see it is done in the Vitrum Antimonii, or glass of Antimony, and yet not be able to make it evaporate: for, that Image 68 (page 102) belongs to Niter to do: and by this you will perceive, that one must be a good Artist, that prepares this Remedy well. Obs. 4. That you must with all the care imaginable, wash, and edulcorate your Magisterie of Antimony, else in stead of being simply Diaphoretick, and opening, it would prove vomitive; because, that though the volatil part of your Niter has carried away with it all the volatil substance of the Antimony, that it had un-chain'd, and set at liberty, yet the fix'd Salt of the said Niter, remaining in the Antimony, retains some part of the emetick substance; therefore, it is necessary, by frequent Lotions, to dissolve the said fix'd Salt, and so extract it. And here again, you see the great pains and care that an Artist is at, in preparing of this Remedy, so excellent, and so much used. Obs. 5. That the Diaphoretick Antimony, is nothing but an Antimony most intimately penetrated, and opened by Niter, and all its emetick and purgative vertues evaporated, and carried away with the said Niter, by a long and great Fire, and then afterwards edulcorated by washing and Lotions. Its �se and Vertues: 'Tis a powerful Diaphoretick, and an excellent Diuretick, apperitive, and desopilative: it is used with good success against all Venereal Diseases; as old Gonorrhaea's, being mingled with some Venice Turpentine, that has been brought to the consistence of Colophone, as we shall teach in the Chapter of the Diuretick Pills. It is very good against the Small Pox, in the weight of a Five Shillings piece of Gold, in Page 103 Water, or Syrup of Cinamon, taking it three days together, to make the small pox come out, and dry; against all opilations, and tumours of the Spleen, the Pancreas, and the Mesentery; incorporating it with the Salt of Tamaris, the Mercurius dulcis, the Crocus martis apperitivus, and scummed Honey, as it is here frequently practised with good success.   The Black and Acid Oyl of Antimony. TAke of Antimony, fine Niter, Brimstone, of each one pound, powder them and mingle them well together; then fire this mixtion, in the same way, and manner, and in the same Vessels that we taught to make the Spirit of Sulphur in. There will rise a vapour, as red as blood, and there will stick to the sides of the Bell, and of the Pan, and upon the surface of the water, a little skin of the same colour: all your Matter being consumed, take your red flowers and mingle them with your water, which is already impregnated, with the acid Spirit of these three Minerals. Put all this into a glass Matrass, unluted, and let it be but three quarters full. Pose your Matrass on a Round, in a small circulatory Furnace, continuing a gentle fire, till your flowers melt, and go to the bottom, and that there appears no Sulphur Image 69 (page 104) swimming upon the Liquor, which will look thick, and of a red dark blackish colour: but take care, that the ebullition be not such, as to run over; or break your Matrass. 'Tis in this case, that one must be a good Artist, and acquire by attention, reason, and experience, a way of Operating surely, and easily. This done, take off your Matrass, and pour out your liquor very hot into a white earthen Pot. When it is cool, separate by inclination the black and acid Oyl, and you will find in the bottom of your Pot a congealed lump of yellow reddish Sulphur, keep the said Oyl in a Glass, well stop'd, and keep your Sulphur to serve you in the making of the Salt of Brimstone. Obs. 1. That Niter is here used to open the body of Antimony, the Brimstone is employed to fix its emetick quality; and the Brimstone, if it were not joyned with Niter, would not be able to inflame the Antimony: for the Brimstone being stifled in these vessels, would presently go out, but the Niter once a-fire, though afterwards stifled, yet sets the other combustible bodies that are with it, a-fire also, till they be consumed. Obs. 2. That the smoak and flowers of this Matter are red, because of the Sulphur of the Antimony, which is redder than ordinary Sulphur, and so communicates its redness to the ordinary Sulphur; it is not the Niter that gives this colour: for, we see that in the Diaphoretick Antimony, it whitens the Antimony. Page 105  Obs. 3. That this Oyl of Antimony is of a blackish red, because of the yellow tincture of Sulphur, mingled with the black tincture of Antimony: and this Oyl is acid, because of the Spirits of Sulphur and Antimony, which both are acid: for, as for the Spirits of Niter, they are all evaporated with the water, in which they were, and the Spirits of Sulphur remain to fix those of Antimony. Obs. 4. That the black and acid Oyl of Antimony, is but an acid Spirit of Antimony, fixt by the Spirit of Sulphur. Its �se and Vertues: 'Tis a good diuretick, and desopilative; it purges gently without provoking vomit: the Dosis is, from three to six drops, in a Glass of a Laxative decoction, or in some broth.   The Butter of Antimony, of which is made the Mercurius vitae, or the Emetick powder, or the powder of Algarot, and the Cinnaber of Antimony. TAke a good corrosive sublimate, and Male Antimony (or rather of the Regulus of Antimony) of each four ounces, powder them, then mingle them, and put them into a glass Retort, luted all over, except in one place towards the Image 70 (page 106) top, and then you must leave a gap to look through: fill your Retort quite full, if you will; for there is no danger of the matters runing out of the Retort in substance; and besides, a gentle fire will presently distill as much of it, as is desired. Pose your Retort upon a Round, in a small wheel fire, and fit to it a Glass Receiver, there will presently rise a white vapour, which being dissolved, will distill in form of a whitish Oyl, call'd the Oyl of Antimony, and which in the Receiver, congeals to a kind of Butter. Take great care your fire be not too strong, lest your Mercury revived, should come into the Receiver, and the Cinnaber of Antimony likewise, for that would render your powder yellow, which ought to be white: give then a moderate heat, till by the gap left in your Retort, you perceive all your Matter to be melted into a lump, clear and transparent, like melted Silver; and then you may be sure, that the Oily substance is distilled, therefore take off your Retort. This done, warm your Recipient so melt the Butter within it, which pour out immediately into a small Glass Retort, unluted, and set it in the same Furnace, with the same degree of heat, fitting a Receiver, and so rectifie this oyl once, for to rectifie it twice, would be to diminish so much of its vertue, that in stead of seven grains for a Dose, you would be forc'd to give fourteen. But observe, That if in either of these distillations any reviv'd Mercury should be raised by too great a fire, and so come Page 107 into the Receiver: then separate gently, by inclination, the Oyl that swims on the top. This rectification being done, you must warm again your Receiver, so as to melt the Butter; and when it is melted, pour it presently into a Glass Bell, full of cold water; the water will become as white as Milk, stir it a little, and your Butter will precipitate to the bottom, in form of a white powder: as soon as you perceive that, separate by inclination this first water, which we call Pontick, that is, Sea-water, and is Mineral; for, you must not let this first water, lye long upon your Precipitate, lest this water should contract an aciditie, as great as that of Spirit of Vitriol, and so corrode, dissolve, and diminish a good part of your Precipitate. The Water of this first Lotion, being poured off, pour on presently as much again, and stir your Bell as you did before: then separate by inclination, and continue so doing, till your powder be edulcorated, and your water come away insipid: then filtrate the rest in white Paper, as has been said in the Chapter of the Diaphoretick Antimony. You shall have a very white powder, called the Emetick powder of Algarot; which keep in a glass, close stopped. Towards the end of the first distillation, in your luted Retort; if you have a mind to have the Cinnaber of Antimony, give a violent fire of entire suppression, without any Receiver to your Retort; continue it, till your Retort be sunk and almost melted. This fire will drive the Mercury to the end, and middle of the neck Image 71 (page 108) of your Retort, and when the Operation is done, it will be either revived into Quick-silver, or turned into a gray blackish powder; there will also be driven to the mouth of the Retort, an Antimonial substance, which at the end of the Operation, will appear in form of a crust, as thick as the back of a Knife, and which outwardly is of a grey colour; but being pared, is within red, and is called Cinnaber of Antimony. Now in the bottom of this luted Retort, you will find a congealed lump, which is the rest of your Antimony revived: For, in this Operation, there rises but a small portion of your Antimony, to mingle with the corrosive Mercury, and there rises a little more by the violence of the fire, to make this Cinnaber of Antimony; but the greatest part remains in the Retort revived. Now to see these three substances together, after this violent fire, you must take off your Retort, let it cool, then shake the neck to make the Quick-silver fall out, whether revived, or in a grey Powder; then break your Retort, to find in the neck the Cinnaber of Antimony, and in the bottom a lump of the said Antimony, melted and revived to its first nature. This done, weigh your Butter of Antimony, and your Mercury, as well that which is revived, as that which is in powder, and you shall see, that all this will weigh a little more than the Corrosive sublimate, which you have made use of in this Operation. Weigh likewise the said Cinnaber of Antimony, and the lump of Antimony revived, and you'l see, that all Page 109 this weighs a little less than the Antimony, which you have employed in this Operation; and that shews, that the said Emetick powder comes partly from the Mercury, and partly from the Antimony. Obs. 1. That we use here corrosive, not dulcified Mercury; because, the dulcified having lost its corrosive Salts, would not be able to open the Antimony, and turn it into Oyl: and besides, there would not result out of it an Emetick, because Mercury does provoke vomit, but by its corrosive Salts. Obs. 2. That we use here the best Antimony, nay the best Regulus, because, being well purified and separated from its Sulphur, and its most malignant salts, there is produced of it a more gentle Emetick; and therefore it is better and whiter with the Regulus, than with the Male Antimony; but then, you will have no Cinnaber by augmenting your fire, but only there will stick a Mercurial Chrystalline Salt to the sides of the Retort. Obs. 3. That the Emetick powder of Algarot, is nothing but a good quantity of Mercury, made volatil by a less quantity of Antimony, by the means of the fire, and the volatil Salts that are in the corrosive sublimate, then devested of the said Salts, and sweetned by Lotions. The vertue and use of the powder, is known by its name, which speaks it to be a vomitive, and that it performs much more gently, than the Crocus metallorum; because, the Antimony Image 72 (page 110) we employ is purer, and in less quantity; and because, that the great washings have carried away the venomous Salts. Its Dose in persons grown up, is five Grains; you may give eight in some Conserve, or the yolk of an Egg, or in any Liquor appropriated. The �se and Vertues of the Butter of Antimony: 'Tis a powerful Corrosive, it eats away Warts, and burns pocky Cancers in a moment: but, if it be applyed to any nervous part, it causes an inflamation for four and twenty hours: it is excellent for the exfoliation of Bones, and for the Gangrene. The �se and Vertues of the Pontick water: It is excellent for Ulcers, Itch, Scabs, the Gangrene; you may use it in stead of Spirit of Vitriol, by mingling three or four drops in a Julip, in putrid and burning Feavers. The �se and Vertues of the Cinnaber of Antimony: It is a great Sudorifick in the Pox. The Dosis is, from eight to fifteen Grains.   Bezoard Mineral. TAke as much as you will of Butter of Antimony, melt it gently before the Fire, then pour it into a glass Bell, or Cucurbite, set it in a Chimney, lest the vapours, which you must raise, should offend you. Pour upon it some Spirit of Niter, drop by drop, for else the ebullition would be such, and the red vapours so strong, Page 111 that the matter would run out of the Vessels, and the vapours hurt your Brain. Continue this Injection, till the Mercury and Antimony, which are in form of Butter, be absolutely dissolved by the said Spirit; which you shall know, by pouring on some new Spirit of Niter: for, if there be no ebullition, nor smoaking, then the dissolution is performed; you must pour as much Spirit of Niter in weight, as you have used Butter of Antimony; your dissolution will appear all along of a yellow colour. As soon as it is done, pour upon it, all at once, a quart of Sea-water actually cold; this Precipitant will presently make all your Liquor of a milky colour, and will precipitate your Butter to the bottom, into a very white powder, if you let it stand ten or twelve hours, to the end your Magistery have more time to precipitate entirely: then separate by inclination your Sea-water, impregnated with the Spirit of Niter, which was the dissolvant, and pour on common Water, till it come away sweet and insipid; filter the rest through a white Paper, dry your powder, and keep it in a glass Vial well stopped. Obs. 1. That, if instead of Sea-water, you had made use of common Water for your Precipitation, you would have turn'd your Dissolution into a white Liquor, but you would never have precipitated your powder; because, that though common Water does much weaken the dissolvant, yet it does not do it so much as Sea-water, which, because of its Salt, contrary to the Salt of Niter, does fight with the said Niter, and in the Image 73 (page 112) conflict, causes the sharpest, and most active part of the Niter to evaporate; and so to forsake its hold, as to let the Butter of Antimony fall, and precipitate to the bottom, in form of a white powder. Obs. 2. That, that which we call Sea-water, is made thus, Take four ounces of common Salt, boyl it to dissolution in a quart of Water, in a brass Kettle, then filtrate it through the brown Paper. Obs. 3. That in the great ebullition and effumation, caused by the Spirit of Niter, all the emetick and purgative vertue, which was in the said butter of Antimony, is evaporated, and at last carried away by reiterated Lotions. Obs. 4. That Bezoard Mineral is nothing else but a Magistery, or Precipitate, compounded of a good quantity of Mercury, and a small quantity of Antimony, both being calcin'd, and opened by the Salts of the corrosive Mercury, then devested of the said Salts, by the Spirit of Niter, so that there remains in this Magistery, no other but a Cordial, Bezoardick, Sudorifick vertue. Its �se and Vertue: 'Tis an excellent Sudorifick against the Pox, the Scurvy, all putrid and venomous Feavors. The Dose is, from eight to twelve Grains, in some Conserve; but observe, that if you mingle it with Conserve of Red Roses, it becomes immediately green, for the Reasons that we shall alledge hereafter.   Page 113 The Calcination, or Calx of Lead. TAke Lead, beat it into fine thin plates, and take also of powder'd Brimstone as much, lay them stratum super stratum, in a glaz'd Pot, which set upon two Bricks in the Furnace of a great wheel Fire, and half Suppression; there leave it, till the Brimstone (which of its self, by the heat of the Pot, will take fire) be quite out, and have a care you do not let it stand longer, for fear of melting your Lead, and so reducing it to its first metallick consistence; therefore take off your Pot, and with an Iron Spatula stir your calcin'd matter, to hinder it from getting into a lump; then take it out, and powder it in a Morter, then searce it in a silken Sieve, till it be reduced to an impalpable powder. Obs. 1. That we use brimstone to calcine Lead, because nothing but Brimstone will take Fire, all alone, and burn a good while; Niter would not take fire all alone with Lead, and indeed never is inflamable, but when he is joyned with some combustible Body, as Tartar, Antimony, Charcoal, or Brimstone; and if we did use here Niter, with some of these Bodies, its flame would be too swift to calcine Lead. Obs. 2 That we use a vernish'd Pot for this Calcination, because our Calx is of the same Nature with the Lead of the Pot; and therefore is not in danger of being spoyled: and besides, the vernish will not be corroded by the Sulphur, because Image 74 (page 114) it is not a dissolvant powerful enough to corrode a glazing, so dried, and fastned: for, if the Lead which you will calcine, were not beaten into very thin plates, and Sulphur mingled with it, every where, it would hardly be calcin'd. Obs. 3. That the Calx of Lead thus calcin'd, is nothing but Lead opened, and dissolved by the Spirit, and Salt of Sulphur; and the said Lead will remain in the nature, of a Calx, but as long as there will be some of the Spirit, and Salt of Sulphur incorporated with it: therefore, if you continue your Fire any time after the Calcination, you will evaporate this Spirit and Salt, and so your Lead, devested of them both, will return to its first metallick Nature. Its �se and Vertues: It serves to dry, and cicatrize old Ulcers, when they are cleansed before, and almost fill'd with flesh, by mingling it with some Unguent, as the Diapompholixa, with Hogs grease, reducing it to the consistence of a Plaister. Out of it also is drawn the Salt of Saturn, instead of Lytharge, Ceruse, or Minium.   Page 115 The sweet Chrystals of Saturn, the sweet Salt of Saturn, not Crystallized. The Oyl of Saturn, the Magistery, or Precipitate of Saturn. PUt as much distill'd Vinegar, as you please, into a glazed earthen Pan, set it upon a trefoot, making under a Fire of Coals, and dry Wood, till it begin to simper, and boyl slightly; then put into it by little and little, as much as you please of Lytharge of Gold, or of Silver powder'd, stirring it continually with a wooden Spatula: after it has boyled a little, take off your Pan, and let your Vinegar which is impregnated with the Lytharge settle a while, then pour off the said Vinegar, while it is warm: this done, pour more Vinegar upon the Lytharge, left in the Pan, boyl it, stir it, separate it, and then put more, doing so till all the Lytharge be gone; then filtrate your Dissolutions, while they are warm, through a Coffin of brown Paper, over a glass Cucurbit, which set in a Sand-fire, up to the neck in the Sand, and evaporate all your Filtrations, till they become as red as Bloud, and are covered with a little skin, or Pellicule: then pour them out into little white Dishes, and there let them cool; when they are cold, you shall see that a Image 75 (page 116) great part of the Liquor is congealed into Crystals, or white Christalline Needles, as sweet as Sugar to the taste, and as thin as the Needles of Male Antimony: then gently pour out of these same Dishes a red Oyl, with a Sugar of Saturn, left in the bottom un-crystallized: then take out your Crystals, and keep them in a glass Viol well stopped with Cork, else they will fall into a Calx; and in another Viol keep the said Oyl of Saturn, wh""""h is nothing but the tincture of Saturn, drawn by the Vinegar. If by chance, in evaporating your Dissolutions, you were gone beyond the Pellicule, so as your matter begins to look thick and glutinous, then there would be no crystallizing of it; and therefore, evaporate it to a driness, to make the Salt of Saturn, not crystallized, or make the Magisterie of Saturn. Which is made thus: Take the said red glutinous Oyl of Saturn, or the Dissolution of Saturn, evaporated to the Pellicule, and pour on three or four ounces of either of them, three or four spoonfuls of Spirit of Sulphur, which presently will cause the Dissolution of Suturn to curdle into white Curds, which by little and little will precipitate to the bottom into a white powder. This done, pour on common water, to take away the acidity, both of the Vinegar and Spirit of Sulphur; but pour on Water but once, else all your powder would be spent in a second Water; because, this powder of Saturn, being half calcin'd, is made dissolvable in Water by that little Vinegar, which remains incorporated with it; separate by Inclination this first Water, and filtrate the rest Page 117 through a Coffin of white Paper, or make Trochisks of it, through a glass Tunnel, as has been taught in the Chapter of the Diaphoretick Antimony. Obs. 1. That you must take a glazed earthen Pan, not a Stone, or Glass one; because there is no fear the Vinegar should corrode the Lead of the Vernish: for having been baked in an Oven, it sticks so fast to the earth, that the Vinegar cannot corrode it, neither if it did, were it amiss, since it is here used but for Saturn; a stone one would be unfit, for it would fly, and break, and that happens to all vessels� of this Ware, except to Retorts; for, there the fire circulating equally on all sides, hinders its breaking, which is not the like case in Pans: for, there the bottom only being heated, and the rest cold, they easily break, because of their great driness. For, they are made of one part of a stone powder'd, which is as dry, and as brittle as Glass, and of one part of lean earth, which is not unctuous at all; a Brass Basin would not be proper; for the distilled Vinegar would spend its force in extracting the Salt of the Verdigreece, which mingled with that of Saturn, would make it look green. Ob. 2. That in this Operation we make use of Lytharge rather than of Ceruse, or Minium; because, the Lytharge, having passed the fire of Coppel, is a more Spongeous open body; and therefore more penetrable by the distilled Vinegar, and so will yield a greater quantity of Salt and Ceruce, which has a closer body, because Image 76 (page 118) it has been opened only by distilled Vinegar, which extracts the Ceruse from the Lead, and for the Minium, though it be Ceruse, made red in a Reverberatory fire; yet its body is not so open, as the body of Lytharge; because, it is so re-united, that it is almost recondensed into its Metallick nature. Obs. 3. That before we put the Lytharge into the Vinegar, we make the said Vinegar boil a little; to the end, it may the easilier penetrate, and dissolve so much of the Saturn, as it can load it self withal, and we let the said Lytharge boyl but a little time; because, no more is required for the Vinegar to impregnate it self with Saturn; and if it should stand any longer on the fire, the evaporation would be begun, which ought not to be, till all your dissolutions are together. Obs. 4. That we use here distilled Vinegar for a dissolvant; because, it is not necessary to have a more powerful corrosive to dissolve Lead, which is a soft penetrable Metal; yet, simple Vinegar would not be so fit, as the distilled; as well, because it is not so penetrating, as because it is not separated from its flegm: besides, if it were red, it might spoil the white colour of your Crystals, or Magisterie. Obs. 5. That all your Lytharge is dissolved at last, by reiterated additions of Vinegar; because, that Lytharge is all Lead, and if there should remain any part of it un-dissolved, it would be, because you have not poured Vinegar enough on. Page 119  Obs. 6. That you must stir with a Wooden patule, this dissolution of Saturn, and not with an iron one; because, the iron would black it, whereas your design is to preserve the whiteness of the Salt, which you are to draw from it; and iron blacks, as well by its self, as by its Vitriol. Obs. 7. That all your dissolutions being put together, you must evaporate them to the consumption of three parts, and till there appear a saltish skin, or Pellicule upon the surface of the Liquor; else they would not congeal into Crystals when cold. For, having too much flegm, that salt Spirit of the Vinegar, which hath dissolved Saturn, remains dissolved its self, in the flegm: but, when by a gentle ebullition, and evaporation of the said flegm, the Salt Spirit remains alone, then it Chrystalises easily in a cold place, since it begins to do it already in a hot one, as you see it does by its Pellicule. Obs. 8 That we pour this dissolution, thus evaporated, into white ware dishes; because being warm, it would break a stone, or Glass one, and in an earthen glazed one, the Crystals, because of the glasing, would spoil their whiteness Obs. 9. That these Crystals are in figure like to needles, and somewhat triangular. Some are small, and those are in the bottom; others are greater, and those are upon the brims, and have more of a triangular figure: they are white, because they are a Calx, or Philosophick calcination Image 77 (page 120) of Saturn, made by a dissolvant, which cannot alter their colour; and they are in taste a little acid, and very sweet, or sugarins, acid, because of the Vinegar: sweet, because that Lead, being the sweetest of all Metals, has likewise a very sweet Salt, and thus the Salt of Lead is amongst the Salts of Metals the same, that the Salt of the Indian Canes is almost the Salts of vegetables. Obs. 10. That when you pour two or three spoonfuls of Spirit of Sulphur upon your dissolution, then this acid, being of a contrary nature to the acid of the Vinegar, fights with it, and weakens it so, as to make it lose its hold, and so your Lead presently curdles, and is precipitated into a white powder. Obs. 11 That the Spirit of Sulphur is fitter for this precipitation, than any other acid, because it makes whiter, sweeter, and more pleasant, not only this, but all Magisteries. The Spirit of Vitriol blacks; the Oyl of Tarter has an unpleasant taste of Urin; the Spirit of Salt would be apt to fix with this Magistery; and the Spirit of Niter is too sharp. Obs. 12: That the Crystals of Saturn are nothing but Lead, dissolved and calcin'd Philosophically in distilled Vinegar, then coagulated into Crystals, by the evaporation of the flegm, and part of the sharpest Spirits of the Vinegar, and so yet retaining a good part of the acid of the said Vinegar. And as for the Magistery, it is likewise Lead dissolved, and calcin'd by Vinegar, then evaporated, then precipitated into a white powder, Page 121 by the Spirit of Sulphur, or some other acid, and at last, devested by lotions of the acid and sharp part of the Vinegar, and the said Spirit of Sulphur. The Use and Virtue of the dissolution of Saturn, before its evaporation into Crystals, or into the Magistery, is to cool, and appease the pain, and and hardness of Inflamations; take away redness of the face, and Eresipilae's; the affected part being washed with lint dip'd in it. This mixtion is of a milky colour; and therefore is called Virgina's milk. The Crystals and Magistery have the same vertue, to cool and appease the pain, take away redness, soften hardness caused by inflamation, and attenuate and resolve Tumours: for this purpose, you put five or six grains of them, and as much white Vitriol into a Glass of Rose water, and Plantin mingled, and then in it we dip a thin slice of raw Veal, and lay it upon your Eyes inflam'd, and full of pain, and redness. The same water may serve for the redness of the face, and Erisipelas, dipping in it Linnen, and so applying it to the part affected: as for the oyl of Saturn, it may be mingled with some of your cooling unguents, as the Cerat of Gallen, or the unguentum rosatum, or Populeum, to mollifie, soften, and take away the redness of all inflamed parts; and, if you have not this Oyl, you make use of the Salt of Saturn in its place, for the same end.   Image 78 (page 122) The Crocus Martis aperitivus. TAke of filings of Steel, or Iron, two parts, and of powder'd Brimstone one, mingle them together, and put them into an unglazed Earthen Pot, set it upon two bricks in a Furnace of Reverberation and Suppression, there let it stand, till all the flame of your Brimstone be spent, and after that, give the fire continually for an hour, then take off your pot, break it while it is hot, and presently put the matter into an iron, or Brass Morter, and powder it while it is warm, then spread this powder (which then will be of a colour of Violets) upon a Marble, the air will change the colour to brown, then powder it again, and searce it very fine, and keep it in a glass well stopt. Obs. 1. That we use Brimstone, to open and calcine the body of Steel, or Iron; but, that we put half as much Brimstone, as Iron; because, we intend here but a slight calcination: and the more you put, the stronger will be the calcination, and your Mars will be the more aperitive, or opening; they are powder'd together, that they may the better penetrate one another. Obs. 2. That this calcination ought not to be done in an earthen glaz'd Pot, lest by the violence of the fire, the Lead of the Vernish should melt, and mingle with your Steel, by the activity and flagration of your Brimstone. Page 123  Obs. 3. That you must powder your calcin'd Mars, while it is hot: for, when it is cold, it grows hard, and so would not be so easily reduced to powder. For, even Mars not calcin'd, being actually hot, is soft, and malleable; and therefore, if calcin'd it is more; but both, when cold, do fall to their natural hardness. Obs. 4. That the filings of Steel, or Iron, from black that they were, do become purple by this half calcination, and pulverisation, being impregnated with this colour, by the Brimstone which naturally makes a blew flame; and at last this Purple colour being exposed to the air, becomes brownish, because the fine Sulphureous part evaporating, leaves your Mars to its natural colour. Obs. 5. That this Crocus Mortis Aperitivus, or opening Saffron of Mars, is nothing but the filings of Steel or iron, half calcin'd, and opened by the Brimstone. This name of Saffron does not fit it well, except you mean a burnt saffron; for this powder is not red as Saffron is. Its �se and �ertues: It has the same Vertues as the aperitive Saffron of Mars following; and besides, it serves to make the second Saffron of Mars, and also to make the Christalised Salt of Mars, and the astringent Saffron of Mars.   Image 79 (page 124) Another Crocus Martis aperitivus. TAke the Saffron of Mars, prepared above, put it into a stone Dish or Pan, and pour upon it Spirit of Vitriol, or of Sulphur, to the height of two fingers above your matter, letting it imbibe and impregnate it self for three or four days, then put your matter (which will be in form of Paste) into a great Crucible, and fill it up to the brim, to the end, the heat may work more upon it; set this Crucible upon two Bricks, in a reverberatory Furnace, giving at First and all along for the space of eight hours, the greatest Fire you can; then take off your Crucible, break it with a Hammer, take out your matter, and while it is hot, powder it in a Brass or Iron Morter; then let it cool in the Air, upon a Marble, and it will become red as Saffron, searce it, and keep it close, and well stopped. Obs. 1 That the Spirit of Sulphur, or Vitrial, with which we wet the said Saffron of Mars, which is already aperitive, serves to open it more, and calcine it Philosophically, and that the great Fire does it more perfectly. Obs. 2 That this second aperitive Saffron of Mars, is nothing but Mars opened by four Keys, viz. By filing and powdering, and then by three calcinations, of which, the first is done by the flagration of the Brimstone; the second, by the pouring on of the acid Spirit; and the third, by a Reverberatory Fire of eight hours. Now it becomes Page 125 opening, because its Salt is set at liberty by these Agents. Its �se and Vertues: It is a powerful desopilative; it serves against the yellow Jaundice, the Green Sickness, it provokes the Courses of Maids and Women, and it opens the Spleen, and Mesentery, taken from half a dragm to two, either in the yolk of an Egg, or in a little Conserve of Roses, or some proper Syrup.   The Infernal Stone. Take a little Matrass with a straight long neck, let the belly of it be luted half way, put into it two parts of Aqua-fortis, and one of Silver of the purest, cut or beaten into thin long Plates, so that they may go into the neck of the Matrass, and be the easilier dissolved by the Aqua-fortis; fill but one third part of the belly of your Vessel, set it upon a Round, covered with Sand in the little Wheel-Fire Furnace, giving a small Fire to help the dissolution of the Silver, and to consume the Dissolvant, so as after a gentle boyling, your matter may dry, and change into a black scum, not unlike a Pumice Stone; then encrease your Fire, to melt this scurn half petrified, and continue your Fire, till the boyling cease, and that there rise no more vapours; which will be a sign that your matter is in fusion: then without any delay, pour out your matter into little Brass, or Iron Moulds, prepared on purpose: for, if you Image 80 (page 126) delay the pouring of it out, or if you let it cool in the Matrass, off from the Fire, your matter will be reduced to a white powder, which is the Calx of the Moon, that is, of Silver: and this will thus come to pass, by the almost total consumption of your Aqua-fortis; and therefore, it is necessary to retain some of it in the said calcined Silver; to the end, it may keep the consistence of a Stone: if to this Calx of silver, you give a violent Fire, and add to it half a spoonful of Borax, it will return to its first metallick Nature, and appear like Silver in hardness and consistence; because, that the great Fire, and the Borax together, carry away even the least drop of Aqua-fortis which did keep the said Silver in the nature and consistence of a Calx. Obs. 1. That the Matrass which we use here, must be but little, because we do not ordinarily prepare much of this at a time; then your Fire being small, the matter cannot run out, particularly, where you leave two thirds of your Vessel empty. The Matrass must have a long strait neck, for the greater convenience in pouring out your matter into its Moulds. This Matrass must also be of a strong Glass, such as comes from Lorrain; and besides, must be luted in its bottom half way, lest a naked Fire, drying up the matter, should break the Glass. Obs. 2. That we use here a double quantity of Aqua-fortis to the Silver; not that it is necessary to double the Dose of the Agent, to dissolve the Patient; but, because we desire to make the greater quantity of this Infernal Stone, which will Page 127 be softer and less black; for Silver may be certainly dissolved, with an equal Dose of Aquafortis: and in this case, the Stone would be harder and blacker, and in less quantity: It contains not so much Salt, is sooner consumed, and the Aqua-fortis has not had time to calcine the Silver throughly, from whence the Calx remains blacker, harder, and heavier; which you will easily perceive, if you take notice, that the same thing happens in the making of the ordinary Lime; for, there you shall see some stones, that have not been well calcin'd, look black, be hard, heavy, and crumble less, than the others that have been well calcin'd. Obs. 3. That we may make this Infernal Stone of Niter, instead of Aqua-fortis, and then it will be whitish, and less caustick, and instead of blacking the Skin, and Teeth, which it touches, it will only make them look yellow; because, it is the Vitriol that blacks in the Aqua-fortis, and whets the corrosive virtue of Niter; and take notice here, that none of the other acids, and corrosives can corrode Silver, nor by consequence, serve in this Composition. Obs. 4. That to make a good Infernal Stone either white, greyish, or black, you must use Coppel Silver; for, if you make it with Silver, where there is a mixtion of Copper, your Stone will be green, and soft, will easily melt of it self; from whence you may conclude, that there is no making of it with Lead, or Tin, which yet are softer than Brass; and as for Iron, it can never be dissolved, and brought into a potable Liquor, Image 81 (page 128) because of its great driness and terrestreity. And as for Gold, you may easily make of it an Infernal Stone, of the same vertue, by dissolving it in excellent Aqua-fortis, or in Spirit of Salt, whet by Salt decrepitated; but then, you would have your Labour for your pains, for Coppel-Gold, or Leaf-Gold, is too dear. And as for the Marcassites or half Metals, they are not fit for this Operation, because that their dissolution evaporated, and reduced to a Calx, cannot keep in consistence of a Stone, but remains in powder. Obs. 5. That to give to the Infernal Stone, that firm compact consistence, which is necessary for it, to be of use, it is not enough to dry your dissolution, with a moderate heat, to the consistence a scum half petrified, but you must, when you are gone so far, encrease your fire, and melt the said scum, then in the same instant, pour out your matter: for, if you let it cool in the Matrass, the rest of the Aqua-fortis would evaporate in the cooling, and so there not remaining enough to corporifie the said Calx, it would fall into a powder, which would be the Calx of the Moon. Obs. 6. That to make little Moulds of Lattin, you must hold it a little time over the fire, then it will be maniable and flexible, and not apt to break, then cut off a piece, and roll it about a stick as thick as a quill, and as long as your finger, and so tye it close, remembring to turn up the bottom, so as nothing may go through: then daub it with our Lute, letting it dry; then when you will use it, take out the stick, and in its place pour your matter, which will be condensed Page 129 into petrified Cylenders; which you will easily get out, by taking away the Lute, and cutting the thread that ties your Mould together. Obs. 7. That the Infernal Stone, is nothing but a little Coppel-Silver, dissolv'd and calcin'd Philosophically by Aqua-fortis, then coagulated by the evaporation of the greatest part of the said Water; and at last petrified by the fusion of the said coagulated matter, which has retained enough of the Aqua-fortis, to be in the consistence of a Stone. Its �se and Vertues: It is a gentle and pleasant Escarotick, it consumes by touching all Warts, proud Flesh, Cancers, Ulcers, and red Spots; if you wet with a little Water the said Warts and Spots. It appeases the pain of the Teeth, using it as has been said, upon the part of that Skin, and Cartilage, that makes the hollow of the Ear: the crumbs of this Stone powdered, and incorporated with a Suppurative, consume likewise ill Flesh, rotten in Ulcers. It serves likewise to dye the Beard black, if you put the weight of two or three grains of it into a spoonful of Water, distilled from the green shells of Walnuts; then with a pencel, or some such thing, pass it over your hair three or four times, observing to hold between it and your skin, a little Comb; for else this Water fails not to black the skin, wherever it touches; and that because of the Vitriol that is in the Aqua-fortis: and if sometimes the hair grow green, it is because there has been dissolved in the Aqua-fortis Silver, mingled with Copper, in stead of pure Coppel-Silver.   Image 82 (page 130) Cauteries. PUt a pound of Quick-lime into a stone Pan, pour upon it by spoonfuls about four ounces of common cold Water, not all at once, but by little and little, that so you may gently, and without smoak, slack it, and so retain a good part of its volatile and fusible Salts, which will contribute very much to the fusion of the matter of your Cauteries; and so make them fitter to be moulded into any shape. And besides, it will make them more caustick; for, all volatile Salts are more caustick than fix'd ones. Your Lime being well slack'd, and in the consistence of paste, pour at once upon it as much Water as will reduce it to the consistence of thin Pap, and then put to it immediately two pound of good gravell'd Ashes heat red-hot before-hand, for an hour, in a reverberatory Furnace, and in an unglazed Pot: but, you must put them in by spoonfuls, as hot as possibly you can, as we have already taught, in the making of the Diaphoretick Antimony. This done, pour upon this matter, about four quarts of Water, which is as much as is requisite to dissolve all these Salts, and so let it stand twelve hours, to the end your Water may be well impregnated; and thus you will have a Lixivium: which you must separate by Inclination from its Faeces, into a copper Basin, which by reason of its Vedigreece, will whet your Cauteries more and more, and make them look blewish. Set this Basin Page 131 on a gentle Fire, and evaporate your Lixivium, till it be dry, and have the consistence of a grey Salt. If then you desire to use them, as they are in a lump, and without shape, take off your Basin, and take out your Cauteries by pieces, and keep them in Glass Vials well stopp'd: if you will have them well shap'd, then when your Lixivium is dried to the consistence of a grey Salt, encrease your Fire, and melt the said Salt, and when it is melted into a blew Liquor, then with an Iron Spatula red-hot (else the Salts would presently congeal, and stick to it) take up as much as you please, and let your lump fall by drops, upon a cold Marble, there they will be shaped like half Beads; when they are cold, take them off with a knife, and keep them in glass Vials, well stopp'd with Cork, to keep the Air from them. Continue this, till you have shaped all your matter, and that the remaining become black, and dry, upon which, if you pour some of your Lixivium, which you must have preserv'd on purpose, it will dissolve, and be fit to be moulded as the rest. At last, if there remain, as there will, some black dry matter, you may wash your Basin clean, and throw that away. Obs. 1. That Lime contains two Salts; one fix, and the other Volatile: the fix is dissolv'd in the Water which slacks the Lime; the volatil evoporates in the smoak, and boyling, with this distinction, That if you pour upon it at first all your Water, and so cause a huge ebullition, and smoking, then all the volatil Salt flies away; but if you slack it by little and little, pouring Image 83 (page 132) only some spoonfuls at a time, then there being but a gentle ebullition, and gentle smoak, the volatil Salts are but weakned, and so do dissolve in the Water. Now when you make Lime-water, to serve to the making of the Phagedenick Water; there it is not necessary to slack your Lime so gently, because it suffices, if you retain the fix'd Salt, that so it may be able to dry and consume putrid Ulcers; but when you make the Lime-water to serve to the making of Cauteries, then you must strive to keep in the Volatil Salt; because it is the Volatil Salt, that makes the fix'd Salt, of both Lime and Ashes, to be fusible: and therefore, if you will shape your Cauteries, and make them more Caustick, you must retain the volatil Salt. Obs. 2. That gravell'd Ashes are a Calx, proceeding from the Calcination of the Lees of Wine and old pieces of Casks, which ordinarily are of Oak, so that this Calx contains the Salt of the Lees of Wine, and the Ashes of the said Casks of Oak: the best sort, is that which is blue, and well dried; and you may easily perceive, that it is a Vegetable Salt, and indeed nothing but Tartar calcin'd, or a Salt of Tartar. Now this Salt is fusible, as it has been said: besides, we heat it red hot, and throw it into this Lime-pap, there to dissolve. Heretofore we made use of Ashes of common Wood, of Cabbage, and Bean-stalks; and we may use it still, but this does as well, and is to be had easily at Paris. Obs. 3. That in this Operation, we use no �	 of glazed Earth, lest the Salts of Lime Page 133 and Ashes should corrode the Lead, and so dull their point, and activity, to no purpose, which they are to preserve to cauterize therewith the places, they are applied to; nay, if you do but evaporate your Cauteries in a vernish'd Pan, they will lose much of their force. Obs. 4. That these Cauteries are nothing, but a Salt composed of the fix, and volatil Salts of Quick-lime, and gravell'd Ashes; which having been dissolved in common water, have by evaporation been coagulated in a moderate heat, then having been melted by a greater heat, have been coagulated by cold upon a Marble. Its �se and Vertues: The name shews its caustick escarotick vertues; this kind of Cautery produces its effect in a small time, and yet gently enough, it is always dry, if it be kept well stopp'd in a glass Vial; but, if it be too dry, it cannot dissolve upon the skin: therefore, while you prepare all things for its application, put it to soak in a spoonful of water.   The Magistery or Precipitate of Bismuth. SEt a Cucurbit Glass, Bell, or Head, upon any thing within a Chimney, that so the infectious vapours may not poyson the room, and offend by their stench the Artist, and Spectators: put into your Vessel four ounces of Bismuth, well powdered in a Brass Mortar, pour upon it one or two spoonfuls of Spirit of Nitar, which presently will produce an ebullition, and a stinking infectious Image 84 (page 134) smoak; when they are past, pour on again a like quantity of Spirit of Niter, which will cause the same effect; continue this till you have spent eight ounces of Spirit of Niter: if you pour on too much at a time, your ebullition will be so violent, that all your matter will run over your Vessel, and be lost, and the smoak will be so thick, that by its stinking red vapours, it will go near to do you some mischief. When you have thus spent all your Spirit of Niter; though after the last Projection, all your Bismuth be not dissolved, and devour'd by the said Spirit, nevertheless, separate by inclination, your dissolution, while it is warm, from that part of the Bismuth, which remains undissolv'd in the bottom of your Vessel, and you must pour this Dissolution into a precipitatory Vessel of Glass, or white-ware; and there it will be congealed into a thousand little transparent white Cristals. In the mean time, pour by little and little, and at divers times, some new Spirit upon the Bismuth left in your vessel, to the end, you may dissolve all the pure and good Bismuth that is left in this lump; for, there will remain at last a few black Faeces, which cannot be dissolved. Separate by inclination this second Dissolution in another Glass, or white-ware Vessel, and there let it Crystallize as the former: then take all your Crystals, and mingle them together in a Glass Bell, and there melt them with a gentle heat, and when they are melted, pour upon them a quart of Sea-water actually cold, which will precipitate them into a white Curd, which Curd, Page 135 will by little and little dissolve into a white powder: then separate by inclination this first Water, pour on more, and so continue till your powder be entirely sweetned; nay, do it three or four times after that your water comes away insipid; for, if there did remain the least Acrimony in this powder, it would wrinkle the Face, which it ought to whiten: filtrate this powder through a white Paper, and let it dry upon the said Paper in the shade, taking care to cover it, lest the dust should come at it; and do not dry it by the Fires side, or in the Sun-beams; for then it would return to brown-blackish colour. When it is very dry, put it into a glass Vial, well stopped, and you have the true Magistery, or precipitate of of Bismuth. Obs. That Bismuth is a kind of Marcassite of Silver; and that therefore it is almost as good as Silver, to make by its calcination a good Fucus, or Cosmetick: for, it is certain, that the Precipitate of Silver, made in the same way as this, does much excel the Precipitate of Bismuth. Obs. 2. That to make the Dissolution of Bismuth in Spirit of Niter, you must take a Vessel very broad towards the top, and therefore a glass Bell is the fittest, to the end, that the venemous vapours, that rise out of the matter, may the sooner and the easilier be gone; therefore in a Matrass, these vapours being streightned, would re-impregnate themselves, and make your matter yellow, instead of white. Then your vessel must be Glass, or White-ware; for, in an earthen glaz'd Vessel, your powder would grow black, Image 85 (page 136) because it would dissolve the Lead of the Vernish, and a stone, or unglazed one, be less fit, because the Spirit of Niter might lose, and insinuate it self in the pores of the said Earth. Obs. 3. That though Aqua-fortis can dissolve Bismuth, yet we use it not; because, by its Vitriol the Calx of the Bismuth would be so blacked, as to be useless in the design of whitening the skin. Obs. 4. That your dissolution being poured into a glass, or white ware vessel, does there congeal into a thousand little white Chrystals, transparent and saltish, because that the Spirit of Niter being loaden with the quantity of a Metalick body, Christallises as Metals use to do, after their dissolution. These Crystals are white, because that the Bismuth is as white as Silver, and they melt by a gentle fire, because they were congealed by cold. Obs. 5. That Sea water does precipitate dissolved Bismuth in a white curd, and white powder, because that the Sea-salt which makes the Sea-water, being contrary to the Salt which makes the Spirit of Niter, attakes and fights with it, and so the Niter being weakned, because, that in this conflict its sharpest part evaporates away, lets go the Bismuth, which it had seized upon, and immediately the said Bismuth falls into a white curd and powder. 'Tis true, that the common water by moistening the Spirit of Niter, does much weaken it; but, if in this water there had not been some Sea-salt; the Calx of Bismuth would never have been well separated Page 137 from its dissolvant, neither would it have been precipitated to the bottom of the Vessel. Obs. 6. That you must dry this Magistery in the shade by little and little, and not in haste, or by the fire side, or in the Sun-beams, lest it recover its brown dark colour; for the actual heat, either of the Fire, or the Sun, would revive in it a black burned Sulphur, which sticks to the surface of this remedy: from whence, Ladies that use it may learn, that they must by a double reason keep it in the shade, as well to conserve their own natural beauty, as the artificial beauty which they borrow from this Magistery. Obs. 7. That the Precipitate or Magistery of Bismuth, is nothing but a Calx of Bismuth calcin'd Philosophically by the Spirit of Niter, and then precipitated by the contrariety of the Sea-water, and sweetned by reiterated Lotions. Its �se and Vertues: It is in Physick an excellent desicative for Ulcers, as well as the Magistery of Saturn, and it is likewise a most excellent Cosmetick or Fucus, to make the face and hands white and fair, either by rubbing them with the powder alone, which insinuates its self into the pores of the skin, or else by applying a Pomatum made of one dragm of the said precipitate, and two dragms of �nguentum Pomatum, which you may prepare if you will, with one ounce of white Virgin Wax, and four ounces of Oyl of sweet Almonds, or Acorns, or of Beans, or of the four cold seeds.   Image 86 (page 138) The Spirit, Oyl, and Extract of Guaiacum. TAke a great Stone Retort; lute it every where up to half its neck, lest it should break towards the end of the Operation: fill it up to the neck with Guaiacum, cut either into pieces, or shavings; place it upon the hollow part of the cover of an Earthen Pot, full of ashes, which must be set upon the two Iron Barrs that are in a small Reverberatory Furnace, lute and stop the gap of the Furnace which is above the neck of the Retort, till you have made it even with the top of the Furnace, then fit to the neck of your Retort, a great Glass Receiver, or an Earthen one, if you will, or a great Pitcher which is easilier made clean; because you may put your hand into it even to the bottom; lute the said Recipient to the Retort, cover the Furnace with its top, that is, an Earthen Pan turned the inside downwards, and with a hole in its middle, big enough to pass an Egg through, or else with two or three rounds of Bricks, as has been described in the great Reverberatory Furnace: then put some lighted Coals into your Furnace, and give your fire by degrees, adding to it after a little while three or four Faggot-sticks yet have a care you do not over-heat your Vessel, lest your Receiver break by the violence of the vapours which also may lose themselves through Page 139 the luted conjunction of both the Vessels: the true mark of a fit heat will be, if you can endure to lay your hand a pretty while upon the Receiver, this distillation is to last eighteen or twenty hours without interruption; the Spirit, comes first alone, and in a Glass Receiver appears in the form of white vapours: then the Oyl, with the rest of the Spirits, comes forth in the same form also, and does dissolve into a brown blackish liquor, which goes to the bottom of the Receiver: for all Spirits, and all Oyls, do distil in forms of white vapours, except Spirit of Niter, and Aqua-fortis made with Niter, which therefore are called the flying Dragon, as well because of their redness, as of their malignity. The mark, that the distillation is ended, will be, if your Receiver be cold, though there be an excessive heat in the Furnace; for, that is a sign that there comes nothing more into the Receiver. When all is cool, then unlute the Receiver, by wetting the lute with a wet cloath, and pour out your Oyl and Spirit of Guaiac together, into a glass Tunnel, and by one of these two ways, separate the Spirit from the Oyl. First, take a glass Tunnel, which hold with one hand, and with a finger of the same hand stop its lower orifice, then pour in your Liquor; the Oyl will presently go to the bottom, the Spirit will swim above, and upon the surface of the Spirit will swim some black drops of Volatil Oyl of Guaiac: Then set a glass Vial under the neck of your Tunnel, and let go half your finger which stops the said orifice, and so Image 87 (page 140) the Oyl will pass into your Viol, and when you see that it is almost all passed, then stop the orifice again with your finger, and pour the flegm or Spirit into another Vial. Do thus by all the spirit, and Oyl, you have in your Receiver, but by this way you will never separate the Oyl from the flegm so well, but there will be some in it still. Therefore use this second method which will do it entirely and infallibly. Take a Coffin of brown Paper, wet it with common water, or with Spirit of Guaiacum, if you have any, place it upon a Glass Tunnel, and pour into it the Oyl and the spirit together; the Spirit being watrish will pass, and filtrate through the said Coffin of Paper, and the Oyl will remain; which afterwards you may easily convey into another Vial, by breaking the bottom of your Paper Coffin with a little stick; if you do not wet throughly the said Coffin of Paper before you pour into it the Oyl and Spirit, the Oyl will stick to the Paper, and hinder the filtration of the flegm: If your Oyl do not come kindly out of your Receiver, because it may be it is cold, and so condensed; present your Receiver to the fire to dissolve; your Oyl will be black and stinking, as the Oyl of Jet, and your spirit will be of a brown colour. Out of one pound of Guaiacum, you'l draw about one ounce and a half of Oyl, and ten ounces of Spirit: and there will remain about four ounces of Coals in your Retort: you may kindle this Coal, and burn it to ashes, and of these ashes make a Lixivium, and out of this Lixivium draw Page 141 the Salt of Guaiacum, to the same uses and purposes, as the Oyl and Extract. If you desire to have a Spirit of Guaiacum, purified from the greatest part of its flegm, and corrected of its stench, you must rectifie it in a stone Cucurbite, or glazed one, with a glass head in a Sand furnace, the insipid flegm will come first, that you may throw away; then the Spirit will come very acid, which keep, for those uses which we shall speak of anon. To make the Extract of Guaiacum, put some Oyl of Guaiacum, to evaporate and thicken into the form of an Extract, into a Cup or a Sand-fire or else draw the tincture of the Oyl of Guaiacum, with Spirit of Wine, and so evaporate it to the consistence of an Extract. Obs. 1. That for this Distillation, we use a stone Retort, because it is not necessary to use a glass one, which would be dearer, and the Spirit is not corrosive enough to corrode this Stone-Metal, as the Spirits of Niter, Salt, or Vitriol would do; besides, that the necks of your glass Retorts are so narrow, that the chips of Guaiacum can hardly be got into them. Obs. 2. That if you use pieces of the heart of the Wood, which are hardest, and by consequent fuller of Oyl, you will obtain more Oyl, than from the shaving; and there is no danger in filling the belly of your Retort with them, because it is not a body apt to swell and run over. Obs. 3. That Guaiacum yields a good deal of Oyl and Spirit, because it is full of Sulphur, and Mercury; the Wood yields better than the Image 88 (page 142) Bark, and the Wood in little pieces, yields more than in shavings, or great cuts; for, by their thickness, they retain more of Sulphur and Mercury. This Oyl and Spirit are very Salt, and therefore the Wood is heavie, for the Salts give the heaviness to Mixtes. The Oyl is black and foetid, because it has been distilled in a naked Fire, without any intermedium; and it is heavie, because of its Salt; as also sharp, for the same reason. The Heart of the Wood yields more Oyl, than that part which is near the Bark; which you may perceive by the eye, for the heart is blackish, and the other is yellowish, like Box, which is the European Guaiacum. Its �se and Vertues: The Spirit is somewhat drying and detersive; it is excellent for Burnings and old Ulcers, washing them with some Lint dipped in it; besides, if you put five or six drops of it in a bottle of Sudorifick Decoction, it will work a greater effect, than if there were a great quantity of Guaiacum in the said Decoction; because, this Spirit has the force of the Guaiacum, and besides, much more activity, and penetration, by the tenuity of its Spirituous substance. The Oyl of Guaiacum is very drying, detersive, and cleansing; it therefore cures rarely well old putrid hard Ulcers, the Gangrene, and the Caries, or Rot of the Bones. Besides, you may give by the Mouth two or three drops of it in a spoonful of Cinamon Water, for a windy, or bilious Colick. The Extract of Guaiacum is very drying, and Sudorifick, and it is given in form of Pils, for Veneral Diseases.   Page 143 The Spirit of Box. The Oyl of Ash, &c. THe Spirit and Oyl of the Wood of Box, of the Wood and Bark of Ash, as likewise of all other Woods, and Aromatick Barks, are drawn in the same way, as the Spirit and Oyl of Guaiacum. The Wood of Box yields more Spirits a great deal, than the Wood of Guaiacum; but it yields so inconsiderable a proportion of Oyl, that out of four pound of Wood, you will have but one ounce of Oyl, though four pound of Spirit of Flegm; because this Wood is fuller of Sulphur than Guaicum, but is not so heavie, nor so Salt. Its Spirit has almost the same vertues, as the Spirit of Guaiacum; the Oyl likewise has the same vertues, with the Oyl of Guaiacum, but is most particularly excellent for all Contusions, Ulcers, pain, and rottenness of the Teeth. The Wood of Ash, yields about as much Spirit and Oyl, as Box; its Bark yields but little Spirit, and no Oyl at all. Its Spirit is an excellent topical Remedy for deafness, and tingling of the Ears, because it does incide, and resolve the humours, and flatuosities which lie in the Meatus auditorius, and in the first concavity of the Ear. Its Oyl is also most excellent for the Rot, or Image 89 (page 144) Caries of the Bones, and for the pain of the Teeth; it appeases the pain of the Kidneys, and Spleen, if the said parts be anointed with it.   The stinking, or foetide Oyl of Cloves. TAke Cloves, whose tincture has been already extracted by Spirit of Wine, (for it would be ill Husbandry to use others, and so lose their Aromatick tincture; particularly, since when, they have yielded their tincture, they are never the worse for this Operation) put what quantity you please of them, into a glass Retort, well luted, place it upon a Round hollow earthen Pan, in the Furnace of a great circulatory Fire, fitting to it a great glass Receiver; give at first a very strong violent Fire, and continue it till there appear no more vapours in the Receiver: these vapours are white, and do turn into black caustick, stinking Oyl. Out of one pound of Cloves, you may have about two ounces of Oyl, and eight ounces of Flegm. Obs. 1. That we use here a glass Retort luted, because that stone Retorts are too big for the small quantity of Cloves, which is ordinarily us'd in this process. Obs. 2. That you need not care, if you fill your Retort with Cloves, because they do not swell no more than Woods, or Barks; you may also fill it half full. Page 145  Obs. 3. That Cloves contain much Sulphur, and sharp Salt, from whence it comes that they yield much Oyl, and that very sharp and caustick. Its �se and Vertues: This Oyl being very sharp, and biting, is most excellent for Ulcers in the Pox, and all other putrid and venemous ones; as also it is good to exfoliate, or open the superficies of rotten Bones, and for the Gangrene. Its Spirit is acid, and very good in Tettars, or Ring-worms.   The Oyl of Jet. TAke some pieces of Jet, put them into a glass Retort well luted, filling it up to the neck; place it upon a Round hollow earthen Pan, in a circulatory Fire, and fit to it a great Receiver, which lute well to the neck of the Retort, give at first a small circulary Fire, then the great circulary Fire, and then a Fire of Suppression; there will appear in the Receiver, an abundance of white vapours, which will dissolve into Spirit and Oyl. This Operation must last ten or twelve hours, with a continual Fire, and four pound of Jet in your Retort: out of one pound, you will have about two ounces of Oyl, and ten of Spirit. Separate by a glass Tunnel the Oyl, that goes to the bottom, from the Spirit, which will swim above, and keep them apart in two glass Vials; Image 90 (page 146) upon the Spirit you will perceive swimming, divers thick drops of Volatil Oyl of Jet, which you may leave with the said Spirit. Obs. 1. That we use here a Glass Retort luted for the same reason alledged in the Chapter of the Oyl of Cloves. Obs. 2. That we fill the Retort without any intermedium, because Jet is a dry substance, which does not swell, no more than other Woods and Roots. Obs. 3. That Jet is a Rocky Stone, which is drawn in great quantities out of some Quarrys near Tholous in France; and this Stone is very bituminous, having much Sulphur, a good deal of Salt, and very little flegm; from whence it proceeds, that it yields a good deal of Oyl, moderately sharp, and heavy. Its �se and Vertues: The Oyl is most excellent for the suffocations of the Matrix; because of its extraordinary ill smell, being much more stinking than the Oyl of Guaiac, or Karabe, it serves also to dissolve all bruises, and contusions of the feet, proceeding from walking too much, the flegm has the same, but less vertue than the Oyl.   Page 147 The Oyl of Mirrha and other Gums. TAke a glass Retort well luted, fill it half full of Mirrha, broken into lumps, place it in the Furnace of a circulatory fire. Fit to it a great Receiver of Glass, and give the fire by degrees, there will rise an abundance of white vapours, which in the Receiver will dissolve into a flegm, and an Oyl: this Operation will last five or six hours: Out of one pound of Mirrha, you will have seven or eight ounces of Oyl, and five or six of flegm, separate by a Glass Tunnel the Oyl from the flegm. Obs. 1. That we use here a Glass Retort well luted, for the reasons alledged in the distillation of the stinking Oyl of Cloves. Obs. 2. That we fill the Retort but half full, because that the Myrrha does swell a little being heated, and so if the Retort were full, might run over in substance: yet because it is a rosinous dry Gum, it is not necessary to give it any intermedium. Obs. 3. That Mirrha is a Gumme Rosin, having much Salt, Sulphur, and flegm, and therefore yields a good deal of Oyl, which is very bitter and heavy, as also a great deal of flegm. Its �se and Vertues: This Oyl is very detersive, because of its great bitterness, and therefore Image 91 (page 148) serves to ripen and Suppurate wounds, being mingled with the ordinary digestive: it hinders the Gangrene, being mingled with the Aegyptiac, or other like unguent: it stinks extremely, and therefore being smelt to, helps the suffocations of the Matrix. The Oyls of Mastick, Oblibanum, Storax, Benjamin, and all other Gumms, except Camphire, are made in the same way and method, and without intermedium, as the Oyl of Myrrha.   The Oyl of Bricks, or of the Philosophers. PUt five pound of powder'd Brick into a Glass Retort well luted, then pour into it one pound of Oyl of Olives, either with a Tunnel or a Paper Coffin, in case the neck of your Retort be so straight, that you cannot pour into it otherwise without spilling. Do not fill above two parts of your Retort, left the oyl in boyling should run out in its proper substance, and carry the Brick along with it, before it distill. Place your Retort upon a Round hollow Earthen Pan, in a circulary fire, and fit to it a Receiver. Give the Fire by little and little, and have a care you do not put your Coals near the Retort before the flegm be entirely distilled off, which you will know when you shall hear that your matter makes no more noise in the Retort: then encrease the fire, and Page 149 lay your kindled Coals near the Retort, and at last give a fire of suppression, by covering your Retort, with kindled live Coals. There will come two Oyls, one red, and the other black and stinking, the distillation ought to be performed drop by drop, and besides these drops there come fumes, that is a sign that the fire is too strong, therefore lessen it. This distillation will last four or five hours: out of one pound of Oyl of Olives, and five pound of Bricks, you will have about four ounces of Oyl, and half an ounce of flegm; separate by a glass Tunnel, the flegm that will go to the bottom, from the Oyl which swims upon the top: if you rectifie this Oyl in a little glass Retort in a sand-fire, it will become yellowish and less stinking. Obs. 1. That we use a glass, and not a stone Retort, because the Oyl would penetrate the last, and cannot penetrate the first. Obs. 2. That we give an intermedium to the Oyl of Olives, because it can never be distilled alone and would sooner break the Retort, than distill: and this intermedium, is rather powderd Brick then any thing else; because it being a spongious porous substance, it is sooner imbib'd, and then having little flegm, because it has been baked, it is fitter for this Operation, where much flegm would be prejudicial, and would go near to break the Retort by its combat with Oyl. Some quench pieces of Bricks red hot in Oyl, then powder and distill them, but they have a very small quantity of Oyl, and yet they must use a great Retort, and a great Reverberatory fire. Image 92 (page 150)  Obs. 3. That the Oyl of Bricks is nothing bu"" Oyl of Olives distilled"

OR, A PLEA by way of Remonstrance, for the Publick-Faith of these Brittish Nations, humbly offered to all in Power and Authority, joyntly and individually, by whatsoever Title or Name they are lawfully active; and to whom a care of preserving the Peace and Honour of these Kingdoms doth appertain.  Psalm 82. v. 1, 2, 3, 4, &c. GOD standeth in the Congregation of the mighty, he judgeth among the Gods: How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Defend the poor and fatherless, do justice to the afflicted, preserve the poor and needy out of the hands of the ungodly, &c.  WHereas in the Hopes entertained rationally by this Remonstrant and others, upon his Majesties late voluntary and gracious condescentions (without any care taken for our Indempnity, at his Restauration, by the Trustees of these Nations) they rested thankfully therewith contented; being much Image 3 (page 2) comforted in the Kings prudent and tender respect vouchsafed to their sad condition; and have ever since, (though it be now about eight or nine Moneths) waited in a patient expectation of some timely settlement, according to his Royal Declaration, Speeches, References and Commission; notwithstanding many of them have in the mean time been almost quite destroyed in their estates and credits, and some utterly ruined by the impatience of their Creditors; by the violence of untimely Intruders upon their possessions; by vexatious suits commenced against them; and by paying great taxes and other duties, for those Lands by them purchased, which are intruded upon contrary to an Order of Parliament, and other Prohibitions; as also, because some of the said Purchasers have been so impoverished by former Oppressions, that (to the Publick damage, as well as to their own) much of the said Lands lyeth waste, in regard they have neither wherewith to stock those which came lately into possession, nor means to demise them to Tenants, whilest their Titles are disparaged. Which with other destructive grievances daily multiplying, have constrained this Remonstrant (who in his own person, is made sensible of other mens afflictions, well near in every kind) both for preventing the utter undoing of himself with his Relations, and of many thousands more, together with their Creditors and Relations, humbly to Remonstrate as follows. That the long delayed, and justly expected Relief of the said Purchasers and Lenders (of which this Remonstrant is one) seems to him prolonged by the sinister endeavours or neglects of some from whom they hoped better things, occasioning no less dishonour and hazard to the King and Nation, then injury to their patience, Page 3 whose dammages are multiplyed thereby: For instead of what was rationally hoped for, this Remonstrant and many more, are among other frequent upbraidings and provocations, jeered with this untimely and unsavoury caution, Caveat emptor; which hath obliquely, a worse reflection upon Venders then Buyers in their condition; implying rather Caveant Venditores, in regard it is a Caveat to be given before-hand; and to those only, who contract with persons justly suspected to be either Cheaters or Beggars, and ought not to be applyed to them who were Purchasers from States or Parliaments, who have engaged the Publick Faith of a whole Nation to confirm their Sales and Securities: For they should with reverence be confided in, by all under their Authority, lest such become guilty of exposing it to contempt; and therefore, the said Purchasers and Lenders, were not (till really damnified) to suspect or question, Whether the Grants and Securities to them offered, would be valid or invalid; or Whether the Estates exposed to sale by the Parliament, were justly or unjustly bargained and sold; because it was to be presumed that States and Parliaments, are not only at all times able to make good their Bargains and Securities, or to give full recompence to those who shall be thereby damnified, if it prove otherwise; but that (being thereto obliged both in honour and justice) they will also punctually perform the one or the other, without receding from their Bargains, or hagling like broken debtors: And therefore by one of these wayes, the said Purchasers and Lenders presume they shall accordingly be saved harmless. And, it is their humble desire, it may be timely and effectually done, in respect of those destructive necessities afore-mentioned, whereinto many of them are Image 4 (page 4) plunged; and that they may not be listened unto, who seek to perswade those who should relieve them, that (as affairs now stand) there is no obligation upon the Supream Power, or upon the Representatives of this Nation, to take cognizance of those engagements; For, whatsoever they think, the Publick Peace, and the honour of the whole Nation, together with their Kings and Parliaments, will therein be much concerned, whether their Power who granted those Estates and Securities, were justly or unjustly constituted, or exercised; considering it was then the sole visible Power in being, assented and submitted unto as an authentick Authority, by the greatest number of the people of every degree and qualification, in these three Nations, without any open contradiction (which implies an universall assent, or what is so equivalent thereto, that a factious or rebellious combination could not be justly thereto imputed.) It was acknowledged to be then the Supream Power, not only by popular voices in the air, but by voluntary subscriptions also, under the hands of well near all the Magistrates, Knights, Citizens and Burgers of all Counties, Cities and Corporations in these Dominions, without any open protest made against it; and, de non apparentibus & non existentibus eadem est ratio: Those things, which when they should appear, appear not, reputed are, among the things that are not. Moreover, it was actually owned and obeyed by the Nobility, as the Supream Authority, and by the reverend Judges of our Land in every Court of Record; by the Pastors of Parochial Churches, and Congregations of each several judgement, to be by divine Precepts, and the examplary practise of Christ and his Apostles, that Power (being then the Power which had sole visible being) whereto obedience was due: Such Page 5 also it was generally reputed and acknowledged by the Publick Ministers of all neighbouring Nations, Kings, Princes, and Republicks; wiser then whom, it could not be expected, that this Remonstrant, or any of the said Purchasers and Lenders should have been. Therefore, if they were deceived, the examples of such considerable persons, and so much Reason deceived them, that no man living can be certain, wherein he is not deceived; or that he may not be as much deceived now, or hereafter, as he, and others were heretofore. But, without question, the Powers in being, whether by Gods Grace or permission, all Power being given by him, (even that which Pontius Pilate had to crucifie his Son) are to be the object of our obedience while they continue, whatsoever they seem; and no man can be justly blamed for submitting actively thereunto in meer civil things, or with a passive obedience, in matters relating to GOD and Conscience; nor can this Principle be disadvantagious to the Power for the time being, but will be a great strengthening and security thereunto, if well understood: Even as a man, whether he were lawfully or unlawfully begotten, is truly and essentially a man, and so reputed, as long as the Soul and Body continue together, (howsoever he shall be dismembred by others, or by his own default.) So, that Power and Parliament, by which the said Securities and Sales were given and made, were a valid Power, and a true Parliament, to all intents and purposes, so long as they retained that which was essential to supream Powers and Parliaments, how surreptiously soever that Power was acquired, or whatsoever was but accidentally defective: Or else perhaps, the lawfulness of most Powers and Parliaments, (yea, and of most humane Authorities and Constitutions) would be otherwise found defective Image 5 (page 6) enough to be questioned, and to have all their transactions rendred invalid: And so likewise, they may de facto (how just soever they be de jure) when a Power shall be permitted to raign, which is strong enough to make WILL and PLEASURE the Supream Law: For (to speak truth in plain English, which this Remonstrant heartily loves to do, when just occasion is offered) a prevailing Power, in the hands of Tyrants, (howsoever acquired) is while it hath being, paramount to all Laws and rational Arguments; and will be obeyed in every thing as it pleaseth, right or wrong; or else break or destroy all that opposeth it, till GOD extraordinarily restrains it, or breaks it into pieces. Blessed be his name for it, we are not yet subjected to such a Tyrannie as our sins have deserved; but, to a King from whom we have received an Earnest, making us hopeful that Justice and Mercy will equally flow from the Throne, either when he shall be fully and rightly informed of such particulars as are pertinent to his cognizance and care; or when GOD's time is come: And therefore, this Remonstrant, doth in order thereunto, hereby signifie on behalf of himself and such other Purchasers and Lenders as aforesaid; that, when they engaged with and for the the said Parliament (lent their moneys, and purchased the forementioned estates) they did it not upon any factious Principle; nor meerly to get satisfaction for what they had disbursed, or to have recompence for services formerly done; but, for supply also of Publick necessities, and to dis-engage the said Parliament and Nation from those debts, which were originally contracted for the service of the late King; by which debts, other engagements were (in part at least) occasioned; and Page 7 for discharge whereof, that Parliament was impowered to continue undissolved, till the said debts and engagements were paid and discharged: And this Remonstrant then believed, and still believes, that the said Parliament was fully authorised, both to raise money by what lawfull means they could, to supply publick wants, and to make such Sales and Securities as they proposed, to repay and satisfie for what was lent, bought, or acted by their commands, for the Publick honour or safety: And he so believes, because Parliaments were that Supream Council of the Kingdom, to whose Orders, Acts, and Ordinances, the people had ever heretofore been obedient, without scruple or blame; yea, whereto no less obedience was required, then to the Kings personal commands; nay, much more, as it was then thought, when Empson and Dudley, two eminent persons, (and as this Remonstrant remembers) of the Kings privy Council, were condemned by Judgement in Parliament, and executed for their officious obedience, in executing the Kings illegal Commission under the great Seal of England; which was more obliging, then his personal mandates. A Popular Supream Power, whilest it is actually in being, cannot be properly impeached of Treason, nor any who acts by the commands or authority thereof: Because, it was then our duty to be obedient thereto. And though a single person, or few, or many, yea though Cities, Counties, Provinces, and whole Armies may be Traytors, it is not reasonably supposed the Representatives of whole Nations can so be, and if possibly they might, there is no competent Judge thereof but GOD himself, who usually determineth such differences (as he is LORD of Hosts) by the sword, as he did lately upon a joynt appeal, and afterward, by reversing again that Judgement for the Image 6 (page 8) sins of these Nations, hath righteously executed his dooms on both parties, for their mutual failings in their reciprocal Relations; and which dooms were reciprocally inflicted on both the said parties for their treasons against his divine Majesty, for their gross hypocrisies, apostasies, prophaneness, unmercifulness and injustice, in which many imitate each other to this day. For even many of those actions which ought not to have been done, lay obligations upon their actors and their succssors, when they are done. Children should not be unlawfully begotten; yet when mis-begotten, the parents are obliged in all duties by them to be performed to their children. The Israelites were not to have made a league with the Gibeonites; but when it was made, they were bound to observe it; and for the breach thereof, the whole Nation was punished many years after, and seven of their Kings sons hanged also for that transgression. Moreover, it is further considerable, that the Parliament which made the said Sales, and granted the said Securities, were both the Kings and Peoples Trustees, summoned by the late Kings Writ, to consult about the most weighty affairs of the Kingdom, and delegated by a popular Election, to dispose of the Peoples Interest, as they should find cause, for the Common good. And thereupon, this Remonstrant conceived, he might reasonably have confided as much in that Parliament, as in this now sitting; and doth suppose, that they who make question of the former, may as rationally be doubtful, both of this, and of all future Parliaments; especially, if the successors of that Power and Parliament shall not, (or ought not in equity) to confirm their Sales and Securities, nor give recompence to those who are damnified, out of the estates of those who trusted them Page 9 with the Publick Faith, whose estates, as long as they shall be a people, will in conscience, be liable thereunto. And, it seems to this Remonstrant, by matter of Fact, since the sitting of this present Parliament, that even in their judgement, the Sales and Securities, granted and given by the long Parliament, should be made good according to their intention. For, they caused or ordered payment to be made of very great summs to the now Lord Maior of London, and to Major General Massey; persons who heretofore were of the same judgement with other men, now called Phanatiques; and who then opposed the Kings armed power, both in Field and Garrison, as vigorously as any, in the beginning of the late war; and were instrumental in that, which enabled others to prosecute him to death: These had no other, but the very same Security, which the Remonstrant, and the rest afore-mentioned, had for money lent, lands bought, and services done by the commands of that Representative of this Nation, and which to make good the said Securities, was by a peculiar positive Law, to have been continued as aforesaid, to that purpose, till they were dissolved by an Act of Parliament, with their own consent. The loss of which Power, whether occasioned by their own default, or other mens, or by GOD's immediate justice upon them, is no bar in equity, to the Purchases claimed, Securities or Debts aforesaid; in regard the Nation in whose name they were made and contracted, to whose use the said money was raised, by the said Sales, Loans, and Condescentions; (and upon whose credit also they were granted by their own Acts, personated by their Trustees) is the same Nation by whom all this was transacted, and to whom the injustice and dishonour of violating those Securities will be imputed: And if the Image 7 (page 10) Representative thereof now in being, or some other hereafter impowered, provide not an expedient whereby to disoblige it from the said Securities, it will be a blot upon it (yea worse) whilest it is a Nation. For, it will be liable to the Judgements which are due to such a failing, in what ought to be performed. Also, if those Securities be rendred void, (for whose confirmation such extraordinary provision was made) nothing will hereafter be reputed a good Security, which can be thereby given: For, in probability, States and Parliaments will so lose their credit, that they will not only be reputed the greatest cheaters in the world; and the most cruel and most foolish destroyers of their own honour and relations; but also, in whatsoever necessity they shall be, will never more be confided in, notwithstanding all their specious pretences, plausible Speeches, Declarations, Protestations, and Engagements; and then their Magisterial slighting, contemning, and condemning, just and reasonable Proposals, Cautions, and humble requests of oppressed Supplicants, will have evil Consequents, though they may serve their ends for a while. The Remonstrant fears this Result, and that there are some endeavouring to make invalid the said Securities, together with the Kings gracious condescentions, if it be possible, both to the Remonstrant and others, who can hardly walk the streets without abusive affronts and provocations; in which considerations it is presumed he is allowed by the Law of Nature, (and shall be permitted by your humanity) to plead and insinuate in a peaceable manner, such Motives as reasonably tend to their timely relief; especially, when they are made almost careless of their lives by being totally deprived of that, whereupon life dependeth, through their neglect of Justice to whom they conscientiously adhered. Page 11 But much more weight may be laid upon the Argument drawn from that tender respect, that ought to be had to the honour of the King and his Parliament, which this Remonstrant cannot chuse but frequently touch upon, as being of very high concernment. A Gentleman of the lowest rank, who hath any sense of his true honour, is no less careful to keep his word and promise, then to perform what he is obliged unto by an Instrument confirmed with hand and seal; yea more, because he to whom he stands engaged by the latter, confided less in him, and hath a legal security, whereby he may probably be saved harmless, howsoever he be inclined to make performance, who gave him credit. And it ought to be remembred, that by his Majesties Declaration from Breda, concerning Sales; by a Declaration made in this Parliament the 8. of May last; by his Majesties Proclamation the 6. of June last; by an Order in Parliament last August, restraining Ecclesiasticks from granting Leases of any of the said lands by them claimed; by his Majesties Speech at the end of the first Session of this Parliament; and by the L. Chancellours Speech seconding the same; (which gave hope that som good proceed should be made toward the relief promised, before the Members of this Parliament were arrived at their Countrey-Houses.) It seemed to be the intent both of the King, and of this Parliament, that the said Purchases should, and ought, to have been confirmed to the late Purchasers; and that in the mean time, their possessions should be quieted, and their Rents and Arrears paid unto them by their Tenants: Nevertheless, to the dishonour both of the King and Parliament, the Prelates not only slight the Orders and Acts of the Commons alone, and the Ordinances of the Lords and Commons joyntly, with that which was declared Image 8 (page 12) by the King, as aforesaid; but, do many other wayes, act so violently and arbitrarily repugnant to these condescentions, as if they would make the People believe, that they knew the King and this Parliament intended not what they declared, except only in things relating to the benefit of them the said Prelates: For, the first Votes of this House of Commons, for restoring them to their Mansion-Houses, and the Votes of the Grand Committee, excluding persons, under several Qualifications, (not excepted in the Act of Oblivion) from the benefit of the intended Act for confirmation of Sales, they observe, and impose as Laws upon the People; but, on the contrary, the Votes of the same House, for prohibiting them the said Ecclesiasticks to grant any Leases, until the intended Act of Sales was passed; as also, for the Augmentation of Vicaredges, and the Votes of the said Grand Committee, for satisfying the Purchasers their money and Interest, before they did part with their possessions, they reject as of no force, the Parliament being dissolved; and regard the said Ordinances of the Lords and Commons, and the said Acts and Orders of the Commons alone, much less. Moreover, if in any thing his Majesties Commissioners encline to give the least satisfaction to any Purchaser, the said Ecclesiasticks cry out against it as an Arbitrary Prerogative Commission; though in cases relating to their advantage, they cry up the Prerogative against the Laws. Also upon Petitions of some of the Purchasers (as the Remonstrant is informed) Orders are made, seeming to enable them to receive all Arrears due before the 24. of June last; when it is well known (perhaps to themselves) that by the Act of Oblivion, Arrears to that day are generally pardoned, and that the Tenants who ought to have paid them, lay hold on that Act, and disobey those Page 13 Orders; by which means, Officers are only benefited, and the suiters more damnified by expences, instead of getting relief; So that, whereas Purchasers are invited to bring in their deeds to be cancelled, upon promising that they should receive all Rents due at and before Michaelmas last, it would be plainer dealing to tell them, they should have a Quarters Rent, to relinquish their purchases; for in truth it amounts to no more, from June 24 to Michaelmas next following. Furthermore, there being nothing promised by King or Parliament, as aforesaid, in their Declarations, in relation to the Old Tenants of Prelates Lands, (the said Tenants having had pre-emption before all other, when the said Lands were sold; enjoying also their full term without interruption, during their respective Leases; and being no otherwise displaced, then they usually were formerly when the said Prelates pleased by Concurrent Leases or otherwise, to take these Farms into their own hands, or for the benefit of their children and relations, at the expiration of their Terms) it had been more candid usage, to have absolutely signified to the Purchasers, that the said Old Tenants should be preferred before them, rather then to permit the said Purchasers (deluded by a vain hope) to consume money and time in seeking for a Composition, and to suffer the said Prelates in the mean time, to receive their whole Rents, to eject the Purchasers by force, when they had paid all Taxes, with other duties, not without great expence bestowed in fencing, soyling, plowing and sowing the said Lands; and also to grant Leases, as they have done, to the vacating of all the cost and labour of the said Purchasers, in pursuing what seemed graciously intended both by King and Parliament on their behalf. These and many other passages, which this Remonstrant hath observed, Image 9 (page 14) makes it appear unto him, that there is not that care yet taken to preserve the honour of the King and of this Parliament, in giving satisfaction to Purchasers, as might be wished; and that there is not that respect had to Justice and good Conscience, in satisfying them, as hath been heretofore vouchsafed by Princes, States, and Parliaments in the like Cases. In true Reason, (which distinguisheth Men from Beasts, as Justice and Mercy differences them from Devils) this Remonstrant conceives, that the whole matter in Fact and Judgement, concerning the said Sales and Securities, must unavoidably be brought to this Dilemma; (to wit) either the Long Parliament had Power to make such Sales, and grant such Securities as aforesaid, or else they had not: If they had such a Power, then their Sales and Securities must be allowed and confirmed; or, at least, (if in Law or Equity, restitution of what was by them sold, ought to be made to the former possessors) then recompence must be given another way; else injustice is commited, GOD, and the Nation are dishonoured, and many thousand Families and innocent persons will be unmercifully exposed to ruine; and that severity and want of compassion, for which they were visited in wrath, who last abused their Power, will be more then doubled. GOD is the same he was; and if private men, for not performing their Covenants made to and with each other, (though to their own hindrance) shall be excluded from his Tabernacle; doubtless an equivalent Judgement will be extended to States and Parliaments, or those whom they represent. Then, on the other part it �	 should be granted that the foresaid Parliament �	, and exercised wilfully a Power, not thereto belonging, to the damnifying of those who confided Page 15 in them; that Parliaments successors ought then in Justice, to award satisfaction out of their estates, who arrogated such an unwarrantable Power, as far as they will extend, if they can be distinguished from those among them, who were guiltless: And if that distinction cannot be made, or, the damages exceed their abilities; then, condign satisfaction should be made out of their Common purse, who intrusted those with the Publick-Faith: For, the greatest part of the People have often been too careless upon whom they impose that confidence, and perhaps, will be more wary, when they have well paid for it, what persons they chuse; and be so wise, as to consider, that they who have not wit enough to govern their private estates, or they who consume many thousands of pounds, in Ale houses, Inns and Taverns, (whose reckonings, as this Remonstrant hears, are not yet paid) to procure themselves to be Elected by Feastings and Drunkenness, had probably some worse ends in being so prodigal, then a sincere intention, to serve GOD, the King, and their Countrey. Yet, neither this Remonstrant, nor as he believeth, many of the said Purchasers and Lenders, do expect satisfaction should be made them at full for all their damages, (though in justice it ought so to be) but considering the Publick wants, and other private mens necessities, as well as their own; with how much it may tend at this time to the settlement of Peace and Amity, that every man should enjoy a comfortable subsistence, they would rest contented with so much only toward a repair, as might discharge them from their engagements occasioned by the said Loans and Purchases, to the redeeming the loss of their liberties, and to preserve a competency proportionable to their several Image 10 (page 16) degrees, and the condition of their nearest relations; which might be raised without overburthening any, if such Expedients might be speedily taken into consideration, and vigorously prosecuted, as may be hereafter proposed; whereas the course which is yet pursued, will neither be a means of relieving many, nor of so reconciling disagreeing Parties, but that the Breaches will daily grow wider, and encrease Animosities till they become irreconcileable; and kindle such an universal flame by private fewds and vexatious suits, that it will never perhaps be quenched, whilest ought is left unconsumed, or whilest any considerable number of them, or of their Posterities, are living, who were unhappily engaged against each other in the late war: And for prevention whereof, there will be no possibility in nature, but by a general Forgiveness on all sides, mediated by a moderate course, to preserve in some indifferent measure, that Interest by which each man may be comfortably maintained: For, until that be sincerely endeavoured, prosecuting the rigour of the Laws, by imprisoning, suing, hanging, beheading and quartering will terrisie few of those who have neither estates to lose, nor an outward condition of life worth preserveing: Nor in such cases will preaching the principles of morality, or Evangelical Precepts prevail much, but with men, naturally meek, (or perhaps cowardly) or such as are of so true a Christian and sanctified a temper, that, according to the doctrine and example of Christ, they can freely forgive their enemies, and submit to any thing, wherewith it shall please GOD to permit the Supream Power to exercise their Faith and Patience; which number is so small in respect of the rest of those who are at this time exasperated, in relation to their Estates, Credits and Consciences, (as Page 17 they will pretend at least) that the Publick charge, which the present Government may be constrained yearly to continue, will amount to more, then that which would suffice to calm their spirits, by a repair of their destructive damages: And yet their suppression by violence, may paradventure also, be prolonged, until some advantage be gotten by the changeableness of humane affairs, to let their fury break forth in such a time as may destroy or endanger that peace, which they desire to preserve: For, an Army is a security which hath in it, neither certainty nor safety. It being therefore this Remonstrants principle, not only to seek the preservation of that visible Power whereto God subjects him, out of prudence and moral gratitude, because it protects him; but even for conscience sake also, (though it should oppress him, as the last did) he thinks it his duty to give a Caveat, whereby they whom it shall concern, may take it into consideration, whether both Parties which have opposed each other, are not in some respect so equally guilty of the sins occasioning the Judgements under which they have lain together, or by turns; and whether it will not be their next and safest way to a general peace, to divide the burthen which now lies destructively upon many, to be born by the whole Nation, and to make it as easie, as Justice and Prudence will permit, by an impartial respect to the interest of all Parties concerned: To which end, somewhat shall be proposed before the conclusion of this Remonstrance; not Magisterially, to be strictly so or so prosecuted; but rather, to be a hint of something to that purpose, to be deliberately determined by wiser men. It will be pertinent to common peace, to take notice how many hundred thousands are at this time exasperated, Image 11 (page 18) by being nigh totally destroy'd or much impoverished by the loss of their livelihoods & liberties, with little hope of remedy: Some, by imprisonment upon malicious suggestions only, without any cause of offence given; some by being deprived of their monies exacted, lent or contributed upon the Publick Faith, to that Power whereto they heretofore submitted conscientiously, or by compulsion; some by being ejected forcibly out of Lands, Offices, or other Estates by them Purchased, and formerly belonging to the King, Queen, Prince, Prelates, and such as were then reputed Delinquents; some by taking up, on valuable considerations, those Lands or Offices from the first or second Purchasers and Possessors, in satisfaction, or in relation to debts, jointures, childrens portions, or other collateral Contracts, Securities, or Engagements; and some by great summs expended in buildings or other improvements, borrowed from many who are quite undone by their disability to repay it; occasioning suits and quarrels no less destructive to them, then to the original Purchasers and Lenders. And not a few thousands are as much discontented upon other civil and conscientious accounts, whom to provoke altogether, may be of dangerous consequence, though the Kings Indulgence hath much qualified and settled the minds and estates of some: For little advantaged will they be by a pardon for life, who needed it, or for ought else criminal, who are put into a worse condition by living, then to be executed ten times by the hang-man. The natural temper of this Nation, is for these respects much to be regarded, and they are accordingly to be dealt withall; as it was prudently counselled by King Henry the fourth, upon his death-bed to his Son, whose words I will here insert as not impertinent. I charge thee Page 19 (said he) before God, to minister the Law indifferently to all, to ease the oppressed, to beware of flatterers, not to deferr Justice, nor yet to be sparing of mercy; punish the oppressors of thy people, so shalt thou obtain favour of God, and love and fear of thy Subjects, who whilest they have wealth, so long shalt thou have their obedience; but, made poor by oppressions, will be ready to make Insurrections; Rejoyce not so much in the glory of thy Crown, as meditate on the burthenous care which accompanies it. Mingle Love with Fear; so thou, as the heart, shalt be defended in the midst of the body; but know, that neither the heart without the members, nor King without the Subjects help, is of any force. Speed, pag. 763. This Remonstrant conceives, he might have procured many thousand hands subscribed to attest the reasonableness of this Caution, and of what else is in this Remonstrance expressed or desired; but he endeavoured it not, because, he thinks it will be needless to wise men, who very well know, that common cheat signifies little or nothing, as hands are usually procured. When Reason prevails not more then Voices, there is small hope of Justice. And, as it was said to Dives, They who will not believe Moses and the Prophets, will not believe one sent from the dead. So, may this Remonstrant say, They, who will not be moved to do conscionable and righteous things, for the sake of Justice and Mercy, will little regard Remonstrances or Petitions, subscribed with many thousand hands, till they feel them about their ears; or, until the vengeance of GOD seizes on them, as it lately did on those who neglected good Cautions, until they had not power to put them in execution. Misconster not this, as a secret threat to any in Authority; for it is humbly and soberly intended, to be only a Memorandum, useful at this time, wherein all have not the patience of Image 12 (page 20) Saints, who are grieved or oppressed. That, which hath been, may be again hereafter; and there be among those who are now depressed, some of those Anointed-ones of the LORD, whom he will not permit to be harmfully touched without Vengeance: For, he hath other Anointed-ones beside Kings, whom he often reproves for their sakes; and verily he will not forget the poor for ever, though to humble them for their transgressions, he hideth his face from them for a season; at least, his Everlasting Mercies, he will not take from them. God preserve us from seditious and mutinous repinings; and give us all grace, from the lowest to the highest, joyntly and severally, to endeavour that which prevents desperate Activities, and take away every occasion of temptations thereunto: For, though meek and conscientious men, will, as they ought to do, wait patiently upon GOD in all their sufferings; yet meer natural men, (of which sort, the greatest number of those many thousands consist, who are made almost desperately careless of their lives) will not easily conform to Evangelical principles, (as is before implyed) but, perhaps, when their personal wants are aggravated with the importunings and upbraidings of Creditors, the neglects of friends, and the scorn of enemies, the jears of neighbours, and the cries of perishing wives and children, it may so provoke them, that in such extremities, they will have as a little regard to Reason, Religion and Civil duties, as they had to their sad Petitions from whom they expected Justice or Compassion; and then like provoked English Mastives, (the true Hieroglyphicks of English mens temper) fly upon Bulls, Bears or Lyons, without fear of their inequality in strength and number, or into any dangerous attempts. Take it not therefore offensively, that you are Page 21 in this extraordinary manner forewarned thereof. Many things have been this year permitted by way of premonition, more then at other times. The Waters, which are the Peoples Hieroglyphick, have had several prodigeous motions; the Air, not a few portentuous impressions; yea, the Fire and Earth also; and many other of GOD's creatures have contributed symptoms pertinent to our instruction, which ought to be well heeded; and are no such Non significants, as they would seem to think them, who do what they can to becloud them. It may be, the late Insurrection of those few, called Fifth-Monarchy-men, hath somewhat in it which tends to premonition: For, GOD and Nature never act or permit any thing in vain (no not the falling of a sparrow to the ground, or the numbring of hairs) and, this Remonstrant, therefore, conceiving himself obliged to declare his sense thereupon, will make bold here to insert it, that it may not be altogether fruitless. He truly professeth he knew not one of those persons, so much as by name, and is as far from justifying that, or any such attempt, as they who either martially or legally prosecuted them to their destruction in the flesh. For, though Moses slew the Aegyptian which oppressed an Israelite, being then but a private person, Rahab confederated with forraign spies, to the destruction of her native City; Jael infringed both a League and the Law of Hospitality, in killing Sisera; and Ehud, under colour of presenting a Gift, and of being a Messenger from GOD, slew King Eglon, to whom he was a tributary Subject; and these had no doubt, secret warrants from GOD for those irregular Actings, by a divine impulse upon their spirits, making them content to hazard the destruction of their bodies to a Image 13 (page 22) temporal condemnation in those services; but no such secret ever entred into the soul of this Remonstrant, nor doth he find his heart enclinable to act any thing not warrantable by the revealed will of GOD; because, he finds, as well by what hath within his own experience befaln to some, as by the example of Simeon and Levi, that, men may be so deluded, by their own fancies and corruptions, as to think the most barbarous cruelties are acts of Justice. Therefore he leaves the judgement of those persons, and of such attempts, to those unto whom they appertain, and to God, who only knows their hearts, their purposes and warrants, if they had any; and whose Mercies being infinite, and his Judgements past searching out, doth sometime permit external Judgements to seize upon a few, to make way for many to escape them; and otherwhile exposeth men to temporal cruelties, without mercy here, that an everlasting mercy may be enjoyed hereafter. But, whatever those persons were in themselves; or whatsoever that attempt was in its own nature; this Remonstrant is very certain that it was a Providential permission, for their sins and ours, hinting unto this Generation, things very pertinent thereto; and foreshewing somewhat to come, (if not prevented by Repentance and Amendment) which it will concern us to search after, with as much diligence as we can. What it particularly points at, he hath a dark view by a contemplative Vision, like an imperfect Apparition in the Air, which is not visible enough to be ascertained in words to other men; yet sufficient he thereby discovereth to make it evident to himself, that such previous considerations as these that follow, will be very needfull. First, forasmuch (as aforesaid) GOD and Nature Page 23 act or permit nothing in vain; It is to be considered, that the suddain rising and desperate attempt before-mentioned, tends to more then such a vanity seems to be in it self; and that the Circumstances of the Fact, and the Qualifications of the persons, may have much in them tending to the disquisition of what Providence intended. Secondly, It is to be considered, That if Moral and Religious men, being left to themselves, may be transported into such dangerous extravagancies, what they may possibly be hurried into, who have neither honesty nor Religion to restrain them, if GOD should be then provoaked, to give way to their corruptions, when they are tempted by their Lusts, or exasperated by Sufferings, which they conceive injuriously inflicted. Thirdly, If upon a mistaken Principle, a few persons, seduced to take up carnal weapons to prosecute a spiritual warfare, might be so encouraged, and elevated in their spirits, as to out-dare the whole Power of one of the greatest and most populous Cities in the world; even when her Citizens were in Arms, in readiness upon their guards, and the Militia of the whole Kingdom without her walls, in a defensive and an offensive posture, to assist if need were: It is very considerable, what the effect thereof might be, if the whole Body of GOD's Elect in these Nations, spirited by an unquestionable belief, grounded upon his promises, should engage all together as one man in his Cause, armed with all the spiritual weapons offensive and defensive. Fourthly, It is observable, that those Impulses which are termed Phanaticall, and those persons who are agitated by them, are neither to be slighted, nor inconsiderately treated withall: Because, if they be moved Image 14 (page 24) by divine Instinct, (which may be discernable) as Jonathan and his Armour-bearer were, two of them will be able to rout a whole Garrison, ten to chase an hundred, and an hundred to put a thousand to flight. If they be stirred up, but by a meer Phanatique delusion, they may accidentally, be sufficiently spirited, thereby to vanquish a Power, much superiour to themselves in strength and number, as it hath often happened, when unequal Armies have joyned battle, and the superstitious vulgar were prepossessed by some ominous conceit or presage divulged among them: As for instance, at the battle of Agencourt, (if the Remonstrants remembrance fails him not) when the English, over-powered by their numerous Adversaries, ten (nay twenty to one) as some writers affirm, (when their strength was spent, by sickness and weariness, and they quite surrounded, and seeming without hope of escaping an utter defeat) a prediction being divulged among them, which had long before presaged, that the stones of the field should rise up for them against the French: GOD, who is the giver of Victories, permitted that despicable means, to be instrumental thereto; for, weapons failing, and the English thereby encouraged, took up stones, and obtained the most signal Victory, that ever was gotten in these parts of the world. And the most famous Captains among the Antients, made use of Auguries, Predictions, and such like mediums, to stir in their souldiery such impulses, as we call Phanatique, and very frequently thereby prevailed. Fifthly, If a handful of men (as it were) upon a conscientious account only, built upon a false ground, without being moved with respect to their personal damages or interests, could be so desperately and obstinately resolved: It is considerable, what the desperation Page 25 of so many hundred thousands may amount unto; who are or may be exasperated through unsufferable insolencies and oppressions, making them careless of their lives, by defect of all things pertinent to a comfortable life; they having therewith no sense of Morality, Piety, or Conscience to restrain them, proposed nothing but vengeance; and GOD should then also, therewith let loose the fury of others, whose malevolence and discontents are not yet much heeded, to make them instrumental for the deliverance of those from Oppression, have meekly submitted their Cause to him only. For know, that they who are eminent for nothing so much, as for their prodigality, whoreing, roaring, drinking or swearing; and valiant only in Baudy-houses and Taverns, will run away like sheep before resolute assaylants, made desperate as aforesaid. Know also, that the LORD of Hosts, who is the GOD of Nature, as well as of Grace, is General of a two-fold Militia, furnished with distinct weapons according to the several services whereby they are to glorifie him; the one Natural, and the other Spiritual; and that he makes use of both to correct his Children, and destroy the Enemies of his Kingdom, as occasion is given. The first he employeth in shedding the blood of his malicious opposers, or of incorrigible servants, sometime, with hazzard or loss of their own; and the other, (if need be) he engageth in sufferings, and by contributing their own blood also in his Cause; managing to that end, those offensive and defensive weapons only, which are proper to a spiritual warfare. These last, are those followers of the Lamb whither soever he goeth, who are Saints and Souldiers, in the most super-eminent degree; to whom the other usually make way by the violence of natural Faculties and Passions, Image 15 (page 26) to those Conquests over Prophaneness and Injustice, which must be compleated by Patience, Meekness, Love, constancy in Faith and Prayer. And many of the former may be Saints also, who when their natural corruptions have been soaked in their own blood, or sufferings, and the stains washed out, by being rinsed in the blood of the Lamb, shall have a share both in his Victories and Triumphs. Permit, I pray you, this Remonstrant, with patience and candor, to pursue this plain-dealing a little further, and to add somewhat for vindication of himself, from those mis-interpretations which may be made of his honest and peaceable intentions, in these free expressions: For, when he calls to mind, that Christ and his Apostles were charged with sedition, for innocently Preaching the peaceable glad-tidings of the Gospel, for their safety to whom they preached them; and that some of the Prophets were imprisoned and persecuted as seditious persons, when they declared GOD's Judgements, and what ought to have been performed for preservation of their Common safety; he thinks it not unlikely, in this froward Generation, that some Objections of that kind may be made against him, by their Pride, Malice, or Ignorance, who prosecute their selfends; And he being neither insensible, nor totally careless of those disadvantages which may befall thereby, nor ignorant how easie it is to find wherewith to beat a dog; will now (lest he may be restrained from that liberty hereafter) preoccupate as much as he can, whilest he may, to prevent prejudicacy (if it be possible) by giving reasons for his Remonstrating to the purposes afore-mentioned, and in this unusual mode. He knows how far the just bounds of a free expression Page 27 extends by the Laws of GOD and Nature; and though his body may be enslaved, and kept from the exercise thereof by the cruelty of others, his mind cannot be inthralled, but by his own baseness or pusillanity; and if he must perish, he is resolved to perish like a man, not like a beast, or like one who cuts his own throat for fear of death. He will not whine like a curdog, or snarl at him, when he is beaten or kickt by his Master; nor cry like a Swine, when he is to be slain by the Butcher, or ringed for his rooting; nor doth he think himself obliged at this time, to be as dumb before his shearers, as CHRIST was; nor until a time comes (as it did to him) wherein words will either be wholly in vain, or may tend to prevent that suffering, whereunto he shall believe he was pre-ordained by Providence, for his Masters glory, or for the welfare of other men; and then he will leave scribling, and bear his Cross in silence. But it is yet, seasonable for him to write and speak, and if he now do it not, he may for ever hereafter hold his Peace; for it will be to no purpose. He writes and speaks, with the more boldness, because it is not for his own Interest; but as it lies wrapt up with the Publick Honour, Peace, and Welfare, and is preservable, without injury to other private persons. He acknowledgeth himself subject to the natural desires, fears, frailties and infirmities of the weakest men; yet, GOD, by his Grace, hath (as he hopeth) so habituated him to the Principles, which will preserve him in a warrantable sobriety, that he shall dread nothing, but GOD and himself; or lest by ignorance he may offend against his own Conscience; in which case he is one of the veriest Cowards in the world. He neither doth nor can willingly intend hereby the just offence of any: For he hates nothing, that GOD Image 16 (page 28) hath made, loves him above all things; his neighbour as himself; and his Countrey (if his heart deceive him not) much better. He honours the King, and is, and will be, as faithful unto him, as he was to those who lately exercised Supream Authority; to whom, he was conscientiously faithful to the last hour, wherein GOD permitted them to retain it; never dissembling, jugling, or halting between two Parties; yea, though he was neglected and oppressed by those to whom he was obedient. He that hath no self-love, is as blameable, as he which hath too much, because he wants that rule whereby he ought to regulate a Love to his neighbour; and he who to his power, provides not for his Family, is worse then an Infidel. Therefore, no malevolent repining or discontent, but a Christian regard to his duty, and to those many who are oppressed (which is enough to make a dumb man speak) hath extracted this Remonstrance, quickned with a little more Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury, then usual, that (if he should live so long) he might not solicit in vain for Justice twenty years longer, but have a speedy dispatch one way or other. For, Qui rogat timid�, docet negare, he, who sneakingly demands Justice, as if he were begging an Alms, encourages his oppressors the more impudently to oppress him. And yet, perhaps, he had not adventured to express himself in this mode, if an unresistible impulse had not made impressions on his heart, more for the sakes of others, then for his own. For, though this Remonstrant hath had many provocations thereunto, by the loss of his most precious time, with the ruine of his estate and credit; thousands perhaps, have suffered as much as he that way, whom patience, fear, or stupidity have kept silent; and it would be a shame to him not to suffer as mutely as Page 29 other men; also he is reduced to a subsistence by Charity; but, that hath brought with it such experimental evidences, of Gods merciful supplying a competency from day to day hitherto, that the damage is not only made thereby supportable, but comfortable also: and in this kind, he hath suffered no more then the King, and many persons of honour have been exercised withal. This Remonstrant hath likewise been made the scorn and derision of his enemies, neighbours and acquaintance, and is frequently persecuted with uncivil upbraidings; but, he can pass them over with as little regard, as the barkings of dogs, when he considers what Shimeies they are, who set them on, why, and to what purpose: That, which above all this afflicts him, are the sufferings which have suddenly befaln to some of his needy Creditors, and most near and beloved Relations; who, not accustomed to the want of food, rayment, and such other necessaries or conveniencies as they formerly enjoyed, look otherwhile so sadly upon him, that it makes his bowels yern: Yet, it may be, neither had that been moving enough to embolden him hereunto: But, when to all these inducements, there seemed to be added, in his apprehension, a likelihood of multiplying those Confusions, Oppressions, and Innovations, which will be a dishonour to God, the King, and these Nations; (and as well hazzardous to the Common peace, as destructive to him and others in their private capacities) this Remonstrant thought it better to adventure the tranquility of one man, then to let so many be in danger of perishing, by continuing sheepishly silent: And he confesses there is somewhat of selfness, even in that also; because, he is afraid his own Conscience would accuse him for neglect of his duty, and bring greater distempers upon him, for his Image 17 (page 30) being silent at such a time, then those evils which he might hope thereby to escape: For, GOD having carried him, a long time through many vicissitudes and dangers, giving him frequent experiments what the events of his own and other mens transactions were, and will be, (with an ability in some measure more then ordinary, to illustrate to vulgar capacities, those things which are considerable) he dares not presume to displease and inrage his Conscience, to avoid the displeasure of men, whatsoever outward disadvantages may happen. These things considered, with those Priviledges which are due by the Law of Nature, he conceives neither any digression or expression herein contained is needless, or can be justly questionable; and that, he is not obliged (his present condition being weighed) to make answer unto ought objected, which may tend to the accusing of himself, though he were as blameable as he is innocent. For, he intends nothing to the iniury of Publick or private Interests; nor seeks for ought but his own according to Justice, that he may do Justice to his Creditors and Relations. They who live at ease in plenty; because, they see some appearances of a progress toward the relief of this Remonstrant and other sufferers, do condemn them as over hasty, and more importunate then they need to be: Yea, are pleased to say, that much more is done for them already, then they deserve; and that whatsoever shall be done for them, they will never be contented; which Asseverations are better evidences of their dis-affection to the sufferers, and of their want of true Charity, then of the truth of that which they affirm: And, it is the very same which was imputed to this Remonstrant, at several times, during his almost twenty years solicitation, by some who were formerly in Power, Page 31 when he Petitioned to be relieved for his sufferings in their service; and how justly they did it, may be collected from the literal sense, of this metaphorical illustration thereof: He complained of a consuming fire, whereinto they permitted him to be thrown by their neglects; and after he had long complained, they for a remedy, tost him into a boyling Caldron; that, not contenting him, they threw him into a Frying-pan; therewith he being no more eased, renewed his complaint, and then, they laid him upon a Gridiron; that being as painful, they turned him upon his other side; that, proving as uneasie, he Petitioned again, and was only basted with a few Oylie words, or had Orders pin'd on him, like papers to keep roast-beef from burning; he then once again, made an humble address for more effectual means of relief; whereto some of them angrily replyed, Nothing will satisfie this fellow: and seeing none of the former condescentions, would give satisfaction, they at last cast him into a freezing Lake, wherein he yet remains; and, but that the Charity of others, did otherwhile a little thaw him, he ere this time had been frozen to death, and laid where such Remonstrances as these are needless. These are the Favours which this Remonstrant obtained, from those whom he served faithfully and conscientiously heretofore, though he were personally known well near to all of them, and though most of them were his familiar acquaintance, and some of them his professed friends: Which when he seriously considers, and how he hath nevertheless been from time to time, so many years together, neglected and abused; he can hardly discern whether hath been more injurious unto him, neighbours, or strangers; hypocrites, or prophane persons; seeming friends, or open enemies; his Countrey-men, or some of his own kindred. Image 18 (page 32) But, now he hopes better; for, worse they cannot use him, whom he opposed for their sakes, when they were in Power. And, if that obedience which he now professeth unfeignedly to his Majestie, shall procure so much respect to his present condition, as to allow out of what he thought his own, wherewith to dis-engage him from his Creditors, and redeem his Family from that poverty, which now oppresseth it, he shall not only be therewith contented, but thankfully acknowledge also, to the honour of the King and State, that he finds them, whom he had made his enemies, to be much more just and merciful unto him, then his professed friends, of whom he had best deserved: And it may be possible, that their Generositie, whatsoever he hath heretofore done (or here, or elsewhere expressed) will make them as confident of his Allegiance, as they are of the most faithful of those, who profess obedience and conformity to the Government, and in the most usual mode. Let it not seem unsavoury to any Reader, that this Remonstrant, insists so much upon his personal sad condition and grievances: For, by them he became sensible of other mens Oppressions: By the reality of his own wrongs, he perceived what just cause others might have to complain: Also, without particularizing his sufferings, they could not probably be redressed; and no reasonable or conscientious man, will grudge him the liberty of inserting a leaf or two into that discourse, which was for the relief of many, together with himself; composed solely at his cost and labour, without the least contribution thereunto vouchsafed, either by them or any other: For he may say on his own behalf, as Ulisses did, when he pleaded for the armour of Achilles before the Grecians. Page 33 meaque haec facundia siqua est Quae nunc pro domino, pro vobis saepe locuta est, Invidia careat, bona nec sua quisque recuset. Do not envy my pen, Which often for the weal of other men Hath been employed, if that otherwhile, I, make use of it for mine own availe. But, the means hitherto provided for the relief of this Remonstrant, and other Purchasers and Lenders, doth not yet appear likely to have that gracious effect, which was by them expected, and intended by his Majesty. Therefore, he prayes it may not be offensively taken, if he declares plainly, what the effects thereof hitherto are, and may probably be hereafter, according to his understanding: For, his purpose being to express nothing but in order to the preservation of himself and others from destruction, (nor to be more bold in language, then the heedlesness of this Generation shall constrain) it cannot be justly conceived that he would wilfully insert any word or clause, which might by giving just offence, deprive him of that benefit which he desireth to attain; unless it be thought his Oppressions have made him mad; (as many wiser men have been, who suffered less) and if so, he is rather an Object of pitty, then of displeasure. He is thankful to his Majestie, for not taking those advantages at large, which were providentially put into his hands; and gratefully acknowledgeth the Indulgence vouchsafed to Purchasers by his Commission, for mediating on their behalf, manifest his compassion to be more then their own Trustees have expressed; especially his often hastening the Act of General pardon, and desiring the Parliament Image 19 (page 34) to make the Plaister as large as the soares; nevertheless, the Instrument drawn up to those purposes, seems not to have passed through their hands, who are so sensible of his Peoples Grievances, as he himself was, nor is it possible that he can in so short a time have that full cognizance, which he may have hereafter, of the true state of those many differing Causes, which are to come under consideration, in relation to Purchasers; and therefore the means by him intended may be so defective without his default, that many will be more damnified, then relieved thereby. This is found and felt by experience already. The work imposed is too heavy for so few work-men, in regard the Commissioners are persons of honour, who have other weighty affairs which will divert them, and take up so much time, that not a few being already quite ruined by delay; many more will be destroyed before their Causes can be heard and determined. Some of them have so little whereby to subsist, that they cannot spare out of it, so much as the charge of Solicitation will require. And it is feared, most of those who are yet able, will be wheeled round in such perpetual motions, as they were at Worcester and Drury-houses, to their impoverishing also, by the long contests which will arise from several interfering Securities, Interests, and Claims, still multiplying debates and expences; when so many thousands as are engaged by Original Purchases and Subcontracts, shall from all parts betwixt Saint Michaels-mount and Barwick (some of them two or three hundred miles from their habitations) flock together, with witnesses, Counsel and Sollicitours, to their great cost here, and neglect of their businesses at home. Such a multitude cannot but so obstruct each others proceedings, that many who are best able to bear the Page 35 burthen, may be sore straitened and depressed, by losses in one place, and expences in another; by seeing Officers and making Friends, for that which will amount to little or nothing at the last: For, of much of those Lands which were Purchased, as aforesaid, the Prelates have not power to make Leases for longer term, then during their own lives; and there being no Rule setled by Parliament, whereby final Agreements may be made (in that, and some other Cases, without dispute) the Purchasers will have as questionable Titles hereafter, as they have now; and be perhaps all dead or beggared, before any satisfaction shall be enjoyed. As for the Lands claimed by the Prelates, there is little hope the late Purchasers will have any considerable redress in lieu of them, if the said Prelates be permitted to proceed as they begin; for (except two or three of them only, as this Remonstrant hath heard, who perhaps desire the Episcopal Function should be reduced to the Pristine Constitution) so ambitious are they of Preheminence, and so greedily hunt after immoderate Riches in their old age, that regarding neither the tears of the oppressed, nor Orders of Parliament, nor the Kings gracious condescentions published on the behalf of Purchasers; they following the dictates of their own Avarice, take up the whole Rents, make forcible Entries, grant Leases to them who will give most, and Arbitrarily seize the estates of the Purchasers, before the times limited are expired, or the Kings Commissioners can have time to take their Causes into consideration; and before many can have means to present them, or be in a capacity to treat. This Remonstrant in particular, having now lost about eight years 300. l. per an. in a Purchase of their Lands who were hererofore called Delinquents, which Lands cost Image 20 (page 36) him as good as almost twenty years Purchase in ready money. Also 1681. l. 15. s. 8. d. charged by Ordinance upon the Excise in Course, which, with the Interest thereof, hath been eighteen years almost, unpaid. And now he is in danger to lose totally between five and six hundred pounds per. an. more, in Prelates Lands, in Possession and Reversion; part whereof coming into possession the last year, being unstockt, and not demisable, by reason the Title is disparaged, hath cost him in Taxes, with other duties and necessary disbursments therein dispended, more then twice so much as he could raise out of them, by occasion of the said Prelates forcible Intrusions: The remainder of this Remonstrants stock and goods, were by Attachments out of the said Prelates own Court, (without arrest, or any cause formerly made known, according to equity, or the Common-Law of this Land) illegally (and some of them, as he thinks, feloniously) taken in the night, and carried away, by the said Prelates Officers or Agents, being strangers, without any known lawful Officer. And, the said Remonstrant neither being at home, nor having the liberty of his person, or any other means left to defend himself against such outrages, or to maintain his family, but by charity, is by this usage, and that which hath been thereby occasioned, deprived of as much of his estate, as being sold to the value, and proportionably distributed, might have satisfied most of his personal debts, had it not been so torn from him by some unconscionable Creditors, and the said Officers maliciously confederating together, to the taking away, at the third part of the value, the remainder of his houshold-stuff, wearing apparrel, victuals, and the beds whereon his wife, children, and servants lay; as also the wood in his yard, without any other Authority, but Page 37 Will and Pleasure; for the use of the Prelates now Tenant, who being reputed (perhaps because a Papist) a true Son of the Church, is now seated upon that Farm, which he hath forcibly seized; some of his said Agents being so shameless, as to make answer, when the illegality of their proceedings was objected, that this Remonstrant should not be left able to prosecute his remedy at Law, or words to that effect, which they have made good: Insomuch, that this Remonstrant, is compelled in his old age, to shut up himself in a lone room, without a servant, night and day, both in sickness and health; his wife necessitated, above fifty miles distant, to keep possession, with her maide in a naked house, standing far from neighbours, (and much farther from honest men) and his children and servants being scattered, to seek harbour and livelihood where they can get it. This, and much worse, is the Remonstrants present outward condition; by delay of the Relief hoped for, and by his being thereby disabled to prosecute means of redressing his grievances any further: In the like condition (as he believeth) many thousands are at this day among the said Purchasers, Lenders, and such as fall under them, by the ruine of those who are impoverished by their wants. For, the hopes which they had eight or nine Moneths past, of a timely settlement, hath had so slow a progress, that many who had fair expectations, and best means to improve them, begin to be afraid, it may succeed at last, as in an old Tale, it is said, befell to him, who brought a large piece of cloth to his Taylor, to make him such garments as it would extend unto; who at first, told him, it would make a very good sute, cloak, and coat; but after it had been in his custody awhile, he said to his customer, it would make but a sute and Image 21 (page 38) a cloak; after that, it would make but a cloak; being kept a little longer, he could make but a sute of it; after a few dayes more, but a short coat only; and at last, no more but a very fair Cloth-button: And perhaps, with such a Result some of the Purchasers may button up their baggs of Papers and Evidences (if the King take not their Causes into his special Consideration) and go home three times more damnified, then by losing all at first, without more cost and trouble: For, when they have summed up the money, paid for their Purchases at first; for passing their Conveyances and Concomitant charges; Interest and Brockage for money borrowed; expences in suites at Common Law and Chancery thereby occasioned; as also in Contests many years before Committees and Commissioners for removing Obstructions; and thereto added what it will cost now, before there will be a final settlement, it may possibly amount to so much, that the recompence will be less worthy of thanks, then a peremptory denyal would have been at the beginning; as this Remonstrant hath found by experience; who verily believeth, that after his Demands and Receipts had been stated by the Committee of Accounts for the Kingdom, examined again by the Committee of the Navy; Re-examined by a select Committee of Parliament, and upon that three-fold Examination, had 3950. l. reported to be due unto him, and payment then ordered; if he had totally quitted the said debt, and hoped no more for it, he had been at least 5000. l. richer, then he is at this day: For, if delayes occasioning expences with the loss of eighteen years time, and the money mispent, and so long forborn, had been avoided, and other wayes employed, he might in that space have turned it to more considerable profit. The Proverb saith, He that Page 39 gives quickly, gives twice. A benefit vouchsafed speedily, and seasonably, may be doubled, yea tripled thereby, (as Opportunities may occur) whereas, by being long delayed, Suites, Forfeitures, Interest, or such like, may so augment damages, that twice so much afterward, will not be so beneficial, as a quarter thereof might have been at the first; and to destroy men under a colour of doing Justice, and shewing Mercy, is like the Cats playing with the Mouse, (a making sport at other mens miseries) and one of the greatest cruelties in the world. In brief, by what is afore-expressed, this Remonstrant hath neither the liberty of his person to attend the Commissioners, nor wherewith, but by Charity, to subsist, much less to bear the charge of prosecution, so long as his cause may possibly be undetermined; yea, it will be little better then putting him all that while upon the Rack, yet peradventure be no more available at last, then meat set before a dead man. But, all this Remonstrating is to little purpose, except somewhat may be proposed, out of which an Expedient shall be raised, whereby the Publick-Faith may be redeemed, and the Grants and Securities afore-mentioned be made good, or else a satisfaction given in such manner, that particular Animosities may be allayed, without overburthening, or enseebling the whole Body-Politick; which this Remonstrant thinking possible, will contribute his conceptions thereunto, though perhaps he may have little or no thanks, (but a jear) for his labour. And, though he be so broken in his estate, and overcharged with musings in his mind, that he can hardly compose himself for such a serious contrivement, yet he may stammer out such notions, that wiser men less disturbed, may either make more practicall, Image 22 (page 40) or at least, thereby take hints to discover and prosecute a better Expedient of their own: For, the most prudent men sometimes oversee, what a Fool takes notice of. The only way to settle an universal Peace and Concord, is to satisfie all Interests, as much as may be; especially in things necessary to a competent subsistence, even to the answering of their expectations, who are most carnal, so far forth as they are just; in regard they are likely to be most troublesom. Venter non habet aures, and there are now so many laying claim to that Interest, as will make it dangerous, to exasperate them all at once; and will be injustice to leave any of them unsatisfied, as touching reasonable demands. They whose Grievances are most considerable, are such as have Lent or Contributed upon the Publick-Faith; Souldiers, who adventured their lives in the service of the Parliament; Purchasers of Lands or estates belonging to the King, Queen, Prince, Prelates, or those who heretofore adhered to the King against the Parliament, and such as had either Grants of Estates, or Parliamentary Securities, for payment of debts declared to be due unto them. It cannot be now expected, that the Lands of the King, Queen, Prince, or such as were heretofore reputed Delinquents, should be enjoyed by the said Purchasers, except so far forth only, as in consideration of Improvements, the former Owners will freely, of their own nobleness, give way thereunto, if we look for a perfect concord on their part. And then, how the Purchasers of those Lands, and the Parliaments other Creditors may be satisfied, a course must be other wayes provided; which will be the more easily effected, and the less burthensom, if the Purchasers of Prelates estates, may have satisfaction out of the same Lands; as this Remonstrant conceives, in equity Page 41 and prudence, they ought to have, and also may have, to their reasonable contentment, with an addition of honour and advantage, both to the King and Nation, without wrong to the Episcopal Function, being constituted and confirmed according to Primitive Ordination, derived from the Canon of GOD's Word; such an Episcopacy never being intended (as this Remonstrant believeth) to be exploded out of the Church of England by the Solemn League and Covenant; or to be barred out of Scotland, if the persons were regulated and qualified, as they are charactered by Saint Paul. Those Temporalities which they claim as Prelates, belonged not to them by divine right as Bishops: but, were conferred in time of Popery, to support them as Barons, when they were authorized to sit in Parliament: which Priviledge, being taken away by Act of Parliament, assented unto by the late King, that work is at an end: and work and wages being Relatives, cease both together. Temporal and Spiritual Lords in a Parliament, resemble plowing with Oxen and Asses in one teeme, and by weaving (as it were) Linnen and Wollen together, may make that Linsey-woolsey, both in Civil and Spiritual things, as will be pleasing neither to GOD nor men. The services whereto the Bishops were chiefly ordained, may be best performed, (and with least obstruction to civil transactions) in Synods, or National Councils and Conventions, where no Lordly titles or usurpations are to be claimed or allowed: nor any Precedencies, but for Orders sake only, lest Precedencies, and temporal Dignities, may overawe their fellow-members, and disadvantage the Truth. Bishops being regulated, as aforesaid, and exercising only a Primacy of Order, as Speakers in Parliaments, Prolocutors in Synods, and Presidents in Councils, ought Image 23 (page 42) to be restored; and a competent and an honourable maintenance might be provided for them out of those legal perquisites, which heretofore belonged unto them quatenus Bishops, (and consist with an Evangelical Discipline) none of which are sold from them: and out of those Impropriations, which they formerly Leased for Fines and yearly Rents, giving a Plow-mans wages to their poor Curates. These Impropriations, if they might be timely reserved from being again so misdisposed of by their Avarice, would amount to a sufficiency: yea, and to a far larger Revenue, then many Bishops formerly had, if they were prudently distributed; and would be likewise a quieter subsistance, and somewhat more proper to their Calling; because a maintenance settled upon the Ministry by the Laws of the Land. Moreover, to enlarge that maintenance, convenient places of residence, with Demeasnes and annual Rents enabling them to be hospitable, and incouragers of others to Piety and Vertue, might and would be afforded, by the said Purchasers, out of what was sold unto them. And such a Portion, being settled on them, and their successors, by King and Parliament, as the Donations of Nursing Fathers of the Church, (and not derived from heathenish or other superstitious beginnings dishonourable to God, and scandalous to Religion) would redound more to their honour, then their Baronies and Lordships; be more comfortable to their Consciences, when they must resign their Bishopricks; make their Ministry more effectual to their particular Flocks, and to the preserving of Unity in Fundamentals, between those Congregations which are of differing judgements; render their posterities more prosperous, and their persons more beloved both of GOD and men. The worst this Remonstrant wisheth, Page 43 even to those Prelates, who do but pretend to be the Bishops of Christ, is, that they truly were so; and that they had humility enough to accept of such an offer, on condition he wholly left his hope of repossessing his said Purchase, though he thinks it more possible for him to be restored thereto, then for them long to enjoy that wherewith they seem absolutely invested. Let this be well considered; for though the Prelates and their Favourers, term him a Scribling Fool; The tatlings of Children and Fools, are sometimes to be listned unto by wise and grave men, who know they often speak Truth, when others either will not, or dare not. When the King shall by experience know, how useless the Prelacy is, both to him, and to the Church of GOD; and how serviceable such as are called Bishops may be, when reduced to the Canon of the Word, it is hoped, he may perswade them to submit thereto, and that some of them, will be so convinced in Conscience, as to perceive it will be more honour to GOD and them, then disparagement to their persons, to evidence the power of Truth upon themselves in an humble conformity, and restrain them from unmercifully seeking to enrich themselves by the destruction of so many Families as are now in danger of perishing by their immoderate Avarice. As for the rest of the Hierarchie, this Remonstrant cannot imagine to what good end they may be continued, which will be equivalent to the preventing the thousandth part of that mischief, which will ensue the dispossessing of those who have Purchased their estates. Deans and Chapters, with their Appendants, are a Whimsey of a late invention, as now constituted, which the Primitive Ages neither knew, nor perhaps thought of: A Plant which our Heavenly Father Image 24 (page 44) never planted in his Church; nor are they necessarily pertinent to the service of GOD, or to the edifying of mankind in Piety or Morality; but rather burthensom and scandalous. Most of those vast Revenues which they claim as sacred, (if not all) are no more worthy to be reputed Holy things then the price of dogs, or wages of Strumpets, as I have elsewhere said, in regard much of them were obtained by merchandizing for the souls of men, and were Sacrifices to the Devil, worse then Sacriledge, given (or exacted) by their cunning Brokers, in derogation from Christs meritorious Passion, for expiating of Adulteries, Murthers, and other hainous crimes: Which if they could make evident to be sacred Offerings, and accepted of God as truly such, they might hope ere long to make men believe, that their houses of Office, their very dunghills, yea, their sins, or any thing they pleased so to term, were also sacred. But, what reasonable man can imagine, why such an impertinency should be preserved, when the State is so necessitated, though it were some way useful, and when so many thousands of serviceable and innocent persons may be destroyed by the readmission thereof? Whereto are they necessary? If you suppose it be to elect Bishops, when they shall be reduced to what they Originally were and ought to be; that Constitution, will admit of no such Election: Such as now are, may be as well chosen by the King himself, as by vertue of his Letters directed to the Deans and Chapters; or more properly, by his Conge deslere to the Pastors of the respective Diocesses; which Presbyters may likewise officiate, (if need be) at their Cathedrals by turns (having provision made for them at such times) more to the edifying of the People then heretofore: And their Cathedrals which, (to speak truth) Page 45 are more pertinent to the Civil honour and magnificence of the Nation, then essential to the Worship of GOD; (and being built, ought rather to be upheld, for decency and conveniency, then wholly neglected) and may so be, without any great burthen to the Purchasers, by contributing toward their Repair a yearly Rent to that purpose, if the old Fabrick Lands be not sufficient, and unsold: These may also, be of use for pious exercises and devout meetings, more to the glory of GOD, and the edifying of his People, then at present they are, by those irreverent persons, who serve their own selves only, under a pretence of serving GOD, with empty ounds, Tautologies, vain Repetitions, and loud vociferations, mingled with abominable prophaneness: For, this Remonstrant heard it lately credibly averred, that one of those, who is to oversee and direct those who sing in the Quire, hearing a discord in their Musick, was so serious in his Musicall Devotion, that moved to indignation, he passionately swore aloud in these words, By God, a snarle: And that another, angrily calling upon the Boyes to raise their Voices higher, cursed them with four several great Curses within a little space, whilest they were chanting out their Divine Service, (as they call it) because they answered not his expectation. Oh! abominable zeal. But, should it be granted, that GOD required their Will-Worship, that, they were conscientiously devout therein; that, their Prelaticall Constitution, at least were not scandalous, & that their large possessions were the real charitable Donatives of truely devout Benefactors, irrevocably set apart from common use (not one of which particulars can be proved) yet, little or nothing considerable, is or ever was performed, to such pious Image 25 (page 46) uses as are pretended, or were intended. For, by their own Canons (or, by such as they approve of, and will be conformable unto, when it may be for their personal advantages) there is but a third part of their yearly Profits due to them. One third is by those Canons to be employed in maintaining their Cathedral-Churches and dwelling-Houses, with the services and necessaries to them belonging: Another third, is to be for relief of the Poor and Strangers; and a charitable Bishop of York, (as the Remonstrant remembers) was so far from the mind of our Prelates in these dayes, that to relieve the Poor in a time of Famine, he sold away most part of the Utensils and Ornaments of the Churches in his Diocess. A third part only, of the Revenues of the Cathedrals and Prelates, was to have been made use of for themselves and their Families, which hath nigh quite swallowed up the other two parts: For, it is well enough remembred, how ruinous many of their Edifices were, before the beginning of the late war, and how slovenly kept in some places: It is also well known, that the Poor were usually relieved with little more then the scraps of their superfluities; and that the Strangers by them entertained, during the dayes of their Residency, were but their fellow Prebends, their kindred, their familiars, and now and then a bold Guest, who had no need of their Hospitality; and why should many honest men, more serviceable then they, be starved or beggared, by being deprived of what they bought of the Nations Representative; that such large Revenues might be shared by a few, and consumed to so little purpose? With what confusion of face, will these pretenders to Piety and Hospitality appear, when Christ Jesus, personated in this life by their Conscience; or, when he shall hereafter in his own person, Page 47 say unto such, Depart from me ye workers of iniquity: For, having large Patrimonies intrusted with you, to supply the wants of the members of his mystical body, they neither fed him, when he was hungry, except with stones and Scorpions, instead of bread and fish; nor gave him drink when thirsty, except mingled with Vinegar and Gall; nor cloathed him when naked, but only with superstitious raggs, or else Robes impurpled with his own blood; Nor housed him when harbourless, except in a prison, because he approved not of their Vanities, Avarice and Ambition. This Remonstrant, is not so cruel to Beasts nourished out of curiosity, and for mens pleasures only, as to starve them when they are bred; much less that men unprofitably employed at the Publick cost, should be left destitute of a competent subsistence, when that abuse is reformed; nor ought such in his judgement to enjoy more then a just competency, much less ten times more then better deserving persons. All the whole Hierarchy of this Nation (as this Remonstrant is informed) doth not consist of a much greater number, then those Prophets of whom Jezebel fed four hundred every day from her table; if so many of those now in being, shall enjoy a plurality of Prebendaries, Parsonages, Vicaridges and Spiritual promotions, as did heretofore: For, some had two or three Dignitaries, some more; and it the Hexameter of this well known Distich be a true memorial of it, one of them had five beside his Income by Usury; (For the Pentameter concerned him not.) Usury, St. Dunstans, Pauls, Windsor, Salsbury, Christ-Church, Bristol, Westchester, Banbury, Bangor, Asaph. Image 26 (page 48) The Impropriations only, formerly belonging to the Prelates, (which are all nigh out of Lease) are worth yearly (as this Remonstrant is credibly informed) an hundred forty and two thousand pounds. The Parsonages and Vicaridges, which beside their Cathedral Dignitaries, the Deans, Prebends, Archdeacons, and some of the Bishops had in Commendam, being no Parsonages or Vicaridges of the least value, (if they have pluralities as formerly) may be worth to each individual person, between two and three hundred pounds per an. at least, one with another; to which being added the Profits of their Spirtual Functions and Jurisdictions, and their Temporalities now repossessed with vast improvements, will probably amount to above a thousand pound yearly, for every individual Prelate. And what a barbarous cruelty were it, under colour of a Mock-Piety, to destroy many Families, for the superfluous enriching of every one of these? To starve a whole Hive of Bees, to feed a single Drone? and peradventure, to the occasioning of that, which may draw after it a worse consequent. For, these (as the Remonstrant believeth) are one kind of those Locusts which came out of the smoak of the Bottomless Pit, and were in part driven hence about the end of the last hundredth year, as a noysom pest. Therefore, this Remonstrant hopes, that you whom it concerns, will consider how imprudent an Act it will be thought by unbyassed men, in this and future generations, needlesly to hazzard the confusions, despairations, exasperations, and destruction of so many thousands of Families as may be impoverished, to the impoverishing of as many thousands more by their poverty, if the sale of Cathedral Lands should be made void to the said Purchasers, for the superfluous enriching of an inconsiderable number of useless persons; Page 49 and for the pleasing of a few, whose Claim and Interest dies with their persons, to the discontent of many whose right will never die, but still revive, and continue for ever in their heirs; yea, and to do it contrary to Laws and Presidents, for confirmation of the like sales, judged agreeable to Justice and Equity, by Princes, Parliaments, and other grave Councils, upon mature deliberation: And it is hoped also, if (as report goes) the Prelates intend out of their vast Fines and Rents, to raise and maintain two Regiments of Horse in the Kings service, to be continued by his favour in that which they repossess; it will be perceived, that they would but stick him down a feather, in lieu of the Goose which they have gotten: For, the Incomes of two of their Cathedral Revenues, will yearly defray that expence, and leave those Proprietors of them, more then ever they heretofore possessed: And perhaps the King will take notice also, that (if it tend not to the beginning of another Prelatical war) it is at best offered but to make such a diversion for the present, as antiently succeeded, when to prevent the intention that former Parliaments had to take away their large Possessions for Publick Use; they then offered to their Kings a contribution, toward the recovering their right in France, or toward regaining of the Holy-Land, (as they called it) which tended only to their own advantage, though respect to them was thereby pretended. This Remonstrant could alleadge much more, which is of Publick concernment, both in reference to what is last mentioned, and to the Publick-Faith; but, the times will not bear it: much Reason, as well as much Learning, would make some to grow mad; and it were imprudence to express more then can be born, to the Image 27 (page 50) rendring of that less effectual which is expressed. He had lived 36. years, when the last great Pestilence broke in, whereof he was a Remembrance to this Nation; and having survived since that time 36. years more, hath seen enough to give him cause to fear, that a worse infection is beginning; which if GOD's extraordinary mercy prevents it not (by shortning those dayes for his Elects sake) may continue at least 36. years together; even a Spiritual Pestilence, intermixed with many natural Plagues and Distempers: For, some have begun to make way for it, by endeavouring how they may divert us, from heeding the True Antichrist, and to draw this Generation, to look after a new Antichrist, by ridiculously confining him, and the two witnesses, to persons, fraternities and places, which neither consist with those Terms, Qualifications, Transactions, Powers, civil Death and Reviving, which do manifest them, according to what is revealed in GOD's Word; nor with that universal Relation which they have to the Catholick Church, and to the overthrow of the enemies thereof; as will appear when that impudence is more evident; and when to see her delusions, and to hate and prosecute the WHORE, GOD shall put it into the heart of that King, with whom the tenth part of the mysterious Babylon shall fall from her. As for that scare-crow of a pretended Sacriledge, wherewith fools only are affrighted, and with which the Prelates ignorantly (if not impudently) charged as well many preceding Kings, Parliamenes, and persons of Honour and Integrity, as the late Purchasers of Cathedral Lands, it will shortly appear so ridiculous a Bug-bear, that the Publishers of that fancy, will be ashamed (if they have any shame) to hope they shall be able to perswade his Majesty, and this Nation, that Page 51 alienating of their Prelatical possessions from the Church (as they call their Corporations) is the sin of Sacriledge. For, this Remonstrant is so confident on his part, of the contrary, that if the Prelate who claims that which he hath Purchased, will thereupon hazzard but half the value in other lands, and allow him but as competent and wise Judges in the Case, as the Parliament of England, and the Pope of Rome were in Queen Maries dayes (when the like Sales were questioned) the said Remonstrant, if judgement pass against him, will resign all that he hath Purchased of the said Lands for a farthing: Or if that all the Prelates be able to prove his said Purchase Sacriledge; or if he be not able to prove that many Prelates who now or heretofore possessed such Lands, as aforesaid, by colour of a divine Right, did not more sacrilegiously get them, enjoy them, and dispose of them, then the late Purchasers, (to wit) when they alienated them for 99. years, to bribe themselves into a Deanary or Bishoprick, or when they conferred them in Fee, or by Lease to their Kindred, Minions or Concubines. Much more might be added to evidence these things, and to vindicate those from aspersion, who have bought the said Prelates Lands, or alienated them by Publick Authority; but since I had written that which precedes, I had view of a Printed sheet, composed by a learned and judicious Author, and entituled, An Apology for Purchasers of Lands, late of Bishops, Deans and Chapters, wherein so much is alleadged to justifie the alienation of Sales, and Purchases of Lands belonging to Ecclesiastical persons, and that estates granted by Parliament, as aforesaid, ought by Reason, Law and Presidents to be made valid: that I might have spared this Remonstrance, if I had not known by long experience, that men who are sleepy, Image 28 (page 52) (or very busie in serious prosecutions tending to their own profit or pleasure) will seldom heed or hear Reason, until awakened by some unusual noise. It appears then by the Premises, that the Purchasers of Lands belonging heretofore to the Prelates, may have a satisfactory proportion of the said Lands, and yet leave enough to be an honourable maintenance for Bishops, regulated according to their Primitive Institution: and that they who had debts secured by Ordinances or Orders of Parliament upon the Publick-Faith, and such as Purchased the estates of the King, Queen, Prince, or of them whose estates were sold to pay Publick debts, for adhering to the King, must be satisfied by some other Expedient, to prevent those mischiefs which may else befall to the disturbance of Common Peace, by discontenting the one Party or the other: For indeed, till there be a mutual forgiveness, as aforesaid, and such a contrivement, that every man may possess his own, we in vain shall otherwise endeavour, for a settled peace. Now, to compleat the satisfaction desired, there are many hundred thousand Acres in this Kingdom, in Forrests, Chases, and other waste grounds, which being divided betwixt Lords and Tenants, reserving a portion out of their proportions, would amount (with a little contribution out of their estates, who have no Interest in those Lands, that all might help to bear the burthen) not only sufficiently to discharge all Publick debts aforementioned, and to give a competent allowance to the remaining Purchasers; but advance such an improvement also, in corn, grass, cattle, wood, and timber, for fireing, building of Ships, and houses, in time to come, (as provision may be made in Parliament) that might yearly feed a million more of people, encrease Trade, Page 53 supply other defects, produce many conveniencies, and prevent not a few mischiefs: For, that Land which is not worth six-pence by the acre yearly, would be improved to five shillings per annum, that of five shillings to ten, that of ten to twenty, and some to much more; and, by that means, likewise, one of those previous signs of that righteous Government, specified in the Remonstrants BRITAINS-GENIUS long since published, might perhaps be thereby eminently fulfilled (to wit) that, Oxen of the largest Northern breed Should fatted be, where Sheep now scarcely feed. This Expedient would be justly offensive to none (as our case now stands) but, to men of corrupt principles, and such as neither know nor understand the true Interest which Publick or private persons have in such lands; or, who are not willing to lose those opportunities, which they have by the near scituation of their dwellings, to take wholly to their own use, what belongs in a larger measure to other men, living at a farther distance: Or, it may be some poor people unlawfully intruding upon those wastes, having erected Cottages upon them, to the wrong of their neighbours, will complain thereof: But, it will be without just cause, since they may be better provided for by such a division, both for their own and the Publick wellfare, out of those Lands. For, the most part of those poor people who have so intrenched upon the right of other men, to the impoverishing of many Parishes, are very wicked and dissolute persons, living upon pillfering and stealing, or keeping unlicensed Ale-houses in blind corners, wherein is more idleness, drunkenness, and Image 29 (page 54) prophaneness, by night and by day, (especially on the Lords day) then can be imagined by those who have not seen it. Also, a small starvling breed of Jades, and of other unserviceable and improveable cattle, eats up yearly many large Commons, without any advantage comparatively considerable, with that which might be raised by their improvement. The making of Barren Lands fruitful is a temporal blessing, which may be preparatory for a Spiritual Mercy, and a cure of that Curse which is imposed, by making a fruitful Land barren, for the sins of the people that dwell therein. The Forrests and Chases, (though many have now almost forgotten it) were heretofore one of the greatest Oppressions in this Kingdom; and being settled, either by Laws, or by Customs equivalent to Law, may quickly be revived. Beasts and Beastlike men (such as professed Hunters, Falkners and Keepers have been for the most part) had well near the sole benefit of those Forrests and Chases, which were replenished with game. The King received no profit by them, and not much pleasure for which he paid not yearly, more then it was worth; and his Subjects were so misused and tyrannized over by his Officers, that many Gentlemen and others were inforced to forsake their habitations in and about those Forrests and Chases, to prevent undoing, or avoid their unsufferable insolencies: And it would be a double mercy, if by now sacrificing them to Justice, occasion of the like tyrannie for the future might be taken away, and the Publick-Faith vindicated from scandall and violation, by satisfying for the remainder of lands sold as aforesaid, & for those debts whereunto this Nation is liable both in Justice and Conscience. And the Remonstrant humbly prayeth, that by your mediation who are in authority, it may speedily be endeavoured, Page 55 unless the Wisdom of this Generation can find out a better Expedient: For, as it was said heretofore, Jerem. 21. v. 12. to the house of the King of Judah, so, saith this Remonstrant, Hear the Word of the LORD, Oh King and People of England, Thus saith the LORD, Execute Judgement in the morning, (that is, assoon as the cry of oppression comes to your ears, and power into your hands) and deliver him that is spoyled out of the hand of the Oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings. Do Justice, that you may find Mercy, and do not frustrate the prayers of distressed Suppliants, as did they whom GOD hath made exemplary for their failings; nor let all the fore-warnings of your Remembrancer be still in vain, but give ear Oh regardless Generation, to what is timely hereby expressed relating to your welfare. This Remonstrant, will now add for a Corollary, to what hath been hereby offered to consideration, two exemplary executions of GOD's Judgements, for Oppression and Injustice; and one pattern of righteousness in an Ethnick Prince in times of old, with two or three presidents out of antiquity, warranting that freedom which he hath assumed to express his mind so plainly at this time, and then conclude. One of those monitory examples, shall be that prodigious Judgement recorded in holy Scripture, to have been executed upon Sodom and Gomorrah, whose sins were Pride, Idleness, fulness of bread, and not strengthening the hand of the needy, for which God having visited them with a war, as these Nations have been, and delivered them by the hand of Abraham for Lots sake, whom he providentially sent to dwell among them, to be both by his counsel and life, a means to bring them to repentance: Image 30 (page 56) They neglecting to improve those mercies, and continuing in their sins, GOD in a fair Sun-shining morning, after they had spent the preceding night in prosecuting their abominable Lusts, suddenly destroyed them by a most prodigious sulphurous fire descending from heaven, to be an everlasting memorial of his wrath against obstinate impenitent sinners; which is so well known, that it needs no further illustration. The other shall be an example no less prodigious, commemorated in Ethnick History, which the Author declared in words to this effect. In the year of Rome, 720. and in the 43. year of the age of Marcus Aurelius, upon the twentieth day of August, about Sun-set, at Palermo a Sea-Port in the Isle of Sicily, there chanced a thing perilous to them who then saw it, and no less dreadful to those who heard of it afterward. Whilest they of Palermo were celebrating a great Feast with much joy, for the great spoyls which they had taken at Sea from the Numidians, & which the Pirates purposed to divide among them, they were partly prevented by the Magistrates and partly by the said accident: For, when the people were returned to their houses, there appeared in the City a dreadful monster in this form; he seemed to be of the length of three cubits, his head was bald, so that his skull did appear; he had no ears, but two holes in his neck, whereby it was supposed, he heard; he had two wreathen horns like a Goat, his right arm was longer then his left, and his hands were like the hoofs of horses, his shoulders and his head were both of one height, his shoulders shined like the scales of a fish, his breast was hairie, his face in all things like unto a man, save that he had but one eye in the midst of his fore-head, and but one nostril; From the middle downward, nothing could be seen, because he sate in a Chariot which concealed it; the Page 57 Chariot was in fashion like other Chariots then used, and drawn with four beasts; two Lions before, and two Bears behinde. Within the Chariot stood a great Caldron with ears, wherein this monster sate: It wandred a great space through the City, from one gate to another, casting out sparks of fire; which caused so great a fear throughout the City, that women with child miscarried, and some died out-right with fear: Men and women, great and small, ran to the Temples of Jupiter, Mars, and Februa, makeing importunate prayers, with sad cries. At the same time the Pirates were in the Governours Palace, whose name was Solyno, born at Copua, and in that Palace the spoyls being kept, thither the Monster came, after it had wandred through the City, and cutting off one of the Lyons ears, wrote with the blood thereof, upon the Palace gate, these Letters, R. A. S. V. P. I. P. P. These Letters were diversly interpreted, so that the Interpretations were more then the Letters. But in the end, a Prophetess greatly esteemed for her science, opened the true meaning of the Letters, saying, R. signifieth Reddite, A. aliena, S. si, V. vultis, P. propria, I. in, P. pace, P. possidere, which words altogether, make up this sense, Reddite aliena si vultis propria possidere in pace Render to other men that which belongs to them, if you will possess in peace that which is your own. The Pirates were wonderfully afraid of this command, and the woman highly commended for her exposition (but the injunction was not obeyed.) The Monster went the same night out of the City, unto an high hill named Jamicia, and there continued three dayes within sight of the City, the Lions and Bears terribly roaring, and the Monster casting forth flames; during all which time, there was neither bird seen in the air, nor beast in the field near that place, and the people offered great sacrifices to the gods, Image 31 (page 58) yea their own blood, to appease their wrath. Three dayes being passed, there appeared in the Element a marvellous dark cloud, seeming to darken the whole earth, and then it began to thunder and lighten so terribly, that many men died, and divers houses fell to the ground; and at last there came such a flame of fire from the Monster, that it burnt both the Palace where the Pirates were, and all that was therein, consuming the very stones thereof; yea the tempest was so great, that there fell above two thousand houses, and more then ten thousand persons died in the Tempest. In that place where the Monster stood upon the said hill, the Emperour built a sumptuous Temple to Jupiter in memorial thereof, of which Temple Alexander the Emperour made afterward a strong Castle. This is taken out of the Epistles of Marcus Aurelius the Emperour. Thus you have an evidence of two witnesses, one of divine credit, and the other recorded by one of greatest fame among heathen Philosophers and Emperours, to shew how dangerous it is to neglect Justice, and not to render unto every man his own, when God requires it to be done. Also, how honourable it is for Kings and States to do righteous things, and how necessary and warrantable it is, both for men oppressed, and others thereto conscientiously moved, in such times and cases as many are in at this present, to speak truth plainly and boldly, even to the highest Powers on earth, this that follows may illustrate. A testimonial of the first, tending to stir up Princes and States to be ambitious of the like glorious vertues, is taken out of an Epistle of the same Emperour, written to Antigonus. In the twentieth year of my age, I lay (saith he) during the Winter season, in the Isle of Cheten, which Page 59 now is called Cyprus, where in former time lived a King, greatly renowned for Clemency and other Heroick vertues, and who lay there buried under four Pillars within a Tomb, whereon was engraven in Greek Letters, without the addition of his name, (which indeed (saith my Author) I could not learn from any one) an Epitaph to this effect, Whilest, by the permission of the gods, I here lived and reigned, my endeavour was to nourish Peace, and prevent Discord. I desired nothing, but what might be vertuously obtained, without any vitious practises, and what I could acquire by a peaceable means, I never sought to obtain by war and force; or to procure that by rigour, which might possibly be gotten by mildness: I never openly reprooved any man, before I had first admonished him in secret; neither delighted in flatterers, but hated and abhorred lying, both in my self and others: I coveted nothing that was another mans; but, was content with what was justly mine own; spent not prodigally, nor spared nigardly; nor ever deserted any friend in his Adversity. I delighted more to forgive, then to revenge; and punished not the greatest offendors, but with compassion, and much sorrow in mine own heart. Being born of a woman, I was to be subject to the condition of mortals, and dying, was laid here, to be meat for worms as other men are; and having endeavoured to live a vertuous life, did willingly resign my Soveraignty to Death, and my Spirit to the Gods who gave it. How thinkest thou Antigonus? (said the Author) What Image 32 (page 60) an Epitaph was this? How glorious was his life, how eternall deserves his memory to be? I swear unto thee by the Law of a good man, and as the gods may prosper me, I took not so much pleasure in Pompey with his Jerusalem, in Semeramis with her India, in King Cyrus with his Babylon, in Cajus Caesar with his Gaules, nor in Scipio with his Africa, as I do with this King of Cyprus in his grave: For more glory bath that King there in that sharp Mountain being dead, then all these, and all those in proud Rome, who are now alive. Now, out of many approved presidents justifying, by the acceptation they had, the just freedom which men oppressed may challenge, in plainly and boldly declaring their grievances and oppressions to the greatest Potentates of the world, I have chosen two, the first of a Jew, and the other of a German, both which came to Rome, to complain unto the Senate there, on the behalf of themselves and Country-men, oppressed by the Romans. Their speeches being long, I will here Epitomize; and first, that of the Jew, spoken to the Roman Senate, the third year after Pompey sacked Jerusalem, and whilest Valerius Gracchus governed Judea. Fathers Conscript, Your good fortune permitting it, or to say better, we for saking God, Jerusalem which was Lady of all the Cities in Asia, and Mother of all the Hebrews in Palestine� is now servant and tributary to Rome: whereat we Jews need not to marvel, nor ye Romans to be proud thereof; for the highest trees are soonest blown down by violent winds. Great were those Armies whereby Pompey vanquished us, but greater have our offences been, for which we were forsaken of GOD. I would have you to hear by words, but rather to know it by experience, that we have a merciful God, who can do Page 61 more alone, then all your Gods together, and who sheweth compassion, though among fifty thousand there be but ten good men: They are our great offences only, which have made you to be Lords over us; and not your Power or Vertues. For, whilest we agreed in the Unity of Faith in one only God, he prospered us; and so long as the wrath of God is upon us for our sins, so long shall you be Lords over us, and no longer. Then shall we recover what we have lost, and ye shall lose what you have won: And as we are now Commanded, so shall we be then Obeyed; but at present, and whilest we are swayed one way, and ye another, neither can you encline me to the worship of your Gods, neither shall I be able to draw you to believe only in in that one God, the Creator of all things, to whom I refer the disposing of all things. Touching that which I have chiefly to say, Know you, that in times past, Rome had peace with Judea, and Judea with Rome; and being friends, preserved each other in peace; but now it is otherwise, and whilest we sigh for peace, we see, you make preparations for war; whereas, if you would expell those who bear us evil will, and we could know and take heed of them who provoke us to rebell, neither should Rome so much oppress Judea, nor Judea hate Rome. Friendship is lost, not so much for the interest of the one or other, as by their indiscretion who pretend to be Mediators; for if they who take upon them that office, be greater enemies then those between whom a war is begun, they do but cast wood into that fire, which they should quench with water. Since the banishment of Archelaus from Judea, in whose place you sent unto us, Pomponius, Marcus, Rufus, and Valerius, we have had four Plagues, the least wherof was sufficient to poyson all Rome. What greater calamity could happen unto us, then to have Judges sent from Rome, who took up all the evil, customs of wicked men, Image 33 (page 62) and were themselves Inventors of new Vices? And when they, who ought to punish the lightness of youth, are the Ringleaders of Levity? It is openly said in Asia, that the Thieves of Rome, do hang the Thieves of Jewry: and I must plainly tell you, we fear not the Thieves which rob us in the woods, so much as those Judges who spoyl us in our houses. We dread not Robbers on the high-way, nor those who make open war upon us, nor the Plague of Pestilence half so much, as your corrupt Judges. To that, which is here heard in the Senate, and not seen with us, you give more credit, though reported by one who hath been but three Moneths in the Province, then to that which is reported by many who have governed thirty years. Consider ye Senators, that if ye were advanced to this dignity because you were the wisest, the most honest, and moderate among the people, it would appear in your being so just and vertuous, as not to believe all you hear since you have to do with many of divers Nations, whose ends and intentions are variable. I speak the truth unto you, your Judges have done so much injustice, and shown such ill examples, that they have taught the youth of Judea, those vices which our Fathers never heard of, nor we ever saw or read of before: And ye being mighty, and reputed noble, disdain to take counsel of men that be poor, as if to know much, and to have little wealth or esteem, were never found together. As ye have given counsel to us, so be pleased to take counsel from us, and know, that though your Captains have won many Realms by shedding blood, the way to keep them, is by clemency and mildness, without bloodshed; and therefore pray and advise your Judges, whom ye send to govern strange Provinces, that they be more diligent to preserve the Common peace, then to employ themselves in taking Fines and Forfeitures, lest else, they slander you who send them, and destroy those whom they Page 63 should govern and protect: for the reason, why they are not justly obeyed, is, because they command unjust things: Righteous impositions and just commands make men humble and obedient, whereas unrighteous commands, make meek and humble men obstinate and froward; and the more evil things are commanded, the less good things are obeyed, when such persons enjoyn them. Believe this, Oh ye Romans, that from the levity of those in Authority, springs the shamelesness and disobedience of the People. The Prince, who imposeth Government upon those whom he knoweth not to be qualified for such a trust, intendeth not so much that they should do Justice to his People, as that they should increase his treasure and serve his lusts; but let him be well assured, that when he least thinketh of it, his honour and credit will be turned into infamy, his treasure consumed, and some notable vengeance fall upon him or his posterity. I having other matters to speak of in secret, will here conclude, with this advice, that ye keep us and our Countrey in safety; (for which you have hazzarded your selves) and that ye do Justice impartially, for then we shall reverence your commands. Be mercifull, and we shall be meek; be not cruel in punishing our weakness, and we shall willingly obey your just commands; Command not with proud severity, and you shall find in us the Love which Fathers may expect from children, and not that treason, which oppressive Lords usually find in their servants. These words, though bold and sharp, were (as the Author saith) heard with admiration and approbation of all the Roman Senate. The other speech which I will here make use of, was reported by Marcus Aurelius to have been spoken in the Senate of Rome, in the first year of his Consulship, by a poor Countrey-man, living near the River Danubius, Image 34 (page 64) who came to ask Justice of the said Senate, against a Censor who sorely oppressed the Germans: This Rustick was in outward appearance, in some respects, more contemptible then this Remonstrant: For, he is described to have been a man who had a small face, great lips, hollow eyes, of a Sun-burnt complexion, having curled hair on his head, and a long thick beard; his rayment and coat was of beasts skins, his shooes of Porcupine-leather, his girdle of Bull-rushes, his head bare, and a club in his hand: In this equippage he entred the Senate, whereon though many persons were there attending to have their affairs dispatched, this poor man was admitted before all others, and spake in this manner. Oh Fathers conscript, I Mileno a Plow-man, dwelling near the River Danubius, salute you worthy Senators of Rome, beseeching the immortal Gods so to govern my tongue this day, that I may speak that which may be for the welfare of my Countrey, and encline you to do that which may be for the Publick honour of this Empire, for without the help of GOD, we can neither obtain that which is good, nor avoid what is evil. By divine permission, and our wrathful GOD's forsaking us, such was our evil, and your good hap, that your proud Captains of Rome, took our Countrey of Germany by force of Arms; of which ye had been prevented, if we had timely appeased the wrath of God. Great is the glory you have atchieved by your Conquests; but greater will be your Infamy, by the Cruelties which you have committed: For you shall know, (if you know it not) that when the wicked Victors went before the triumphant Chariots crying, Live, Live, invincible Rome; the poor Captives walked after, saying in their hearts, Justice, Justice. Give me leave to speak plainly, your covetousness, Oh ye Romans, in taking Page 65 away other mens goods, hath been so extream, and your commands in strange Countries have been so extravagant, that neither the depths of the Seas can suffice you, nor the wideness of the earth secure us; and there is no other consolation left us in our troubles, but our hope that the Gods who are just, will execute Justice on those who are unjust; which assurance being wanting, we should with our own hands destroy our selves, to avoid the inhumanity of our enemies: But, I hope in the just Gods, that you, who without just cause, have cast us out of our houses and possessions, shall by them be cast out, both of Italy and Rome. In my Country, we take it for an infallible Rule, That he who taketh from another man his right, ought in reason to lose his own; and I trust, that what we have for a Proverb in Germany, you shall have here by experience. By my blunt language, and by the homely apparrel that I wear, you may well imagine me some rude and barbarous Groom: Yet, I want not reason to know who is righteous in keeping his own, and who a tyrant in possessing what is another mans: For though we plain Country-men cannot speak eloquently, we are not ignorant of the difference between good and evil, or that the Gods will take away in one hour, what Tyrants have been gathering many dayes, and restore in one minute, that which good men have lost many years. Believe me, Ob Romans, Goods unlawfully gotten by the Fathers, are the undoing of their Children; and it is impossible, that a wise man should find any contentment, in that which is gained unlawfully, and with an ill conscience. I wonder how he that keepeth another mans goods, can sleep or rest one hour, knowing he hath done injury to the Gods, scandalized his neighbour, pleased his enemies, lost his friends, and put his person in peril, by endamaging those whom he hath robbed. He that taketh away my goods unjustly, will the same day take away Image 35 (page 66) my life if he can. I say and affirm (not caring whether he be Greek, Barbarian, Roman, present or absent, who shall be offended thereat) that he is and shall be accursed of the Gods, and hated of men; who will turn a good fame to an infamy, Justice into Wrong, Rule into Tyrannie, Truth into Lyes, certainties into things doubtful, and destory his own happiness, by depriving other men of their contentment. You Romans are naturally proud, and your pride blinds you, or else you would perceive, that being Lords of great Provinces, you are slaves to your own Riches; and that they both deprive you of your honour, contentment and rest. Hearken to what I shall say, and I beseech the Gods to make you so understand it, that I lose not my labour. I hear all the world exclaim against Pride, and yet none embrace Humility; every man condemns Adultery, yet I see few who live Chastly; most men curse Excess, yet I perceive not any who is Temprate; all men praise Patience, yet none will patiently suffer; They blame sloth, yet spend their time in idleness; All exclaim against Avarice, nevertheless every one robbeth his neighbour; and I speak it here openly in the Senate, not without grief, every mans tongue extolleth Vertue, yet they enslave all their members to Vice; and this I object not against those Romans which are in Iliria alone, but against those also which I see here in this Senate. In your Houses, and about your Arms, you have this Motto, Romanorum est debellare superbos, & parcere subjectis; but, you might more truly have written, Romanorum est spoliare Innocentes, & reddere subjectos. What just occasion brought you from the banks of Tiber, to invade us who lived peaceably nigh the River of Danuby? Were we friends to your foes, or enemies to you? Did we go to conquer other Counrites, or were disobedient Page 67 to our own Lords? Did we either despise your friendship, or defy you as Adversaries? Did any of our deceased Princes bequeath our Lands unto you as their heirs, thereby entituling you to a rightful claiming us for your subjects? Have we destroyed your Armies, wasted your Fields, spoyled your People, or done any outrage or injury, which might provoke you to revenge? Of a truth, none of these, or of any such occurences have happened, as usually give occasion of controversies betwixt neighbours; but meer Covetousness and Ambition were sole causes of your intrusions: For, in Germany, we felt your Tyrannie, as soon as we heard of your Fame. If you be offended with what I have said; be pleased with what I will say; which is this, that the Name of Romans, and the Cruelties of Tyrants, arrived together in one day upon our People. They who have much, do oppress them who have little; Covetousness produceth Malice, and Malice makes way to open Robbery. I conjure you Romans, by the immortal Gods, to heed what I say, and consider what you have done: For either the words of the Gods are not true, or else men with their oppressions, and the world, must come to an end: Fortune must fix a Pin in her wheel, or else that which you have gotten in eight years, will possibly be lost in eight dayes; since nothing is more just, then that the Gods should make you slaves, who have made your selves Tyrants. Do not think, though you have subdued Germany, and are Lords thereof, that it was by your warlike prowess: For, you are no more warlike, nor more couragious, nor more able to endure hardship, then we Germans: But, we, as is aforesaid, provoked the Gods to wrath, and they to punish our sins, have ordained that you should be a scourge to our persons. You are not so strong, nor we so weak, that you had enjoyed the spoyl of our Country, if the Gods had favoured us as much as they Image 36 (page 68) did you: Therefore you obtained not the Victories by the weapons which you brought from Rome, but by the Vices you found in Germany: We were not over-run for being cowards, but for being wicked; and when your Vices are at full, and the Gods as angry with you, as they are now with us, things will succeed better on our behalf. Think not to be the more prosperous or victorious by your great Armies or vast Treasures, or for that you have more potent Gods to assist you, or because you build greater Temples, or offer larger Sacrifices: For know, if you know it not, that none are more favoured of the Gods, then they who execute Justice and shew Mercy. The triumphs of Conquerours are not atchieved by politick Generals, experienced Captains, valiant Souldiers, and numerous Armies: For we have found by experience, that with all these concurring, they can but begin a battle, and that then, the Gods themselves dispose of the Victory: And if I am not deceived, the wrath of the Gods towards us, is so much appeased since our sufferings, and so incensed against you for your cruelties to us, and your unthankfulness to them; that, you who now esteem us to be your slaves, may possibly hereafter acknowledge us to be your Lords. In my travails hither, I have seen high Mountains, large Provinces, several Nations, and barbarous People; and finding Rome to be so many miles distant from Germany, I wonder what fond toy came into your heads, to send to conquer it. If it were for desire of Treasure, I believe, ye spent more in subduing it, then the Revenue of all our Country will amount to in many years, and yet may perhaps also lose it, before you re-imburse what it cost. If it were glory, that you aimed at, great is your vanity; for, little honour is it to have Forts and Towns, where you have not the hearts of the People. If you did it to enlarge Page 69 your bounds; it became neither wise nor valiant men, to enlarge their dominions, and diminish their honour. If you say, it was done, that we should not be barbarous, but civilized according to your mode, I should be therewith well contented: But, how can you give good Laws to strangers, who neglect and break the best Laws made by your own Predecessors? With what credit can they correct others, who deserve as much correction? How can the blind lead the Lame? Why should the proud Romans subdue the innocent Germans? And since every man is so corrupt, and so alienated from the love of God and Goodness, that each taketh what he can, and killeth whom he listeth, what remedy is like to succeed, when neither they who govern will endeavour it, nor they who are oppressed dare complain? Rulers are so hard to be entreated, and so little regard poor mens grievances, that it is not more grievous to endure their oppressions at home, then to come and exhibit their complaints here; because, in their own Country, they have but one Persecutor, and in this place very many; they being rich, and the Complainants poor. Rome, if she be the Mistress of Germany, ought in equity to preserve us in peace by her Justice; Whereas they who go from hence thither, despoyl us of our estates there, and they who are here, rob us of our Good name, saying, we are a People without laws, without Reason, without a King, and may as Barbarians be made your slaves: But, in these slanders you are injurious, since we being as we are, and as the Gods created us, remain peaceably in our own Countries, without desiring to invade others, might more justly and rationally say, that you are men without Law or Reason, in that not being contented with the sweetness and fertility of Italy, you seek to conquer all the world by bloodshed. If you say, we deserve to be slaves, because we have no Prince to command us, nor Senate to govern Image 37 (page 70) us, nor Army to defend us; I thereto answer, that having no Enemies, we need no Armies; that, being contented with our Lots, we wanted not a proud Senate to govern us; and being all equals, had no necessity to be subjected to the humours of a Prince, whose office duly executed, being to suppress Tyrants, and maintain the People in Peace, we wanted not a person to be kept among us to either of these ends; and, if you therefore say, we have in our Country no Common-wealth nor Politie, but live as brute beasts in the Mountains; therein also you slander as: For, in our Country, we suffer no Liers, nor Rebels, nor Thieves, nor seditious persons, nor men who bring us fantastical apparrel, or strange Customs from other Clymates: But, are modest in our Rayment, temperate in our meats and feeding, and needed no better behaviour then our own. Though we have not the Merchandizes of Carthage, nor Oyls of Mauritania, nor wares of Tire, nor steel of Calabria, nor Odours of Asia, nor the Gold of Spain, nor the silver of Britan, Amber of Sydonia, silk of Damascus, corn of Sicilia, wine of Candy, or purple of Arabia: Yet, we have a Common-wealth, and are not brutish: For, these, and such like things, yield more provocations to vice, then helps toward a vertuous life. Blessed is that Common-wealth and Nation, not where riches abound, but where Vertues are commanded, practised, and improved; not where light, proud, and froward persons inhabit and domineer, but where sober, serious, prudent, and meek men reside; and therefore you may have cause to envy our Poverty, and we to pity your condition in being Rich. Would God, you were as well contented with your wealth, as we could have been with our Poverty before your invasions; for then you had not robbed our Country, nor had we been forced hither to complain, where our tears and complaints are not so much regarded, as to effect a diminishment Page 71 either of your pleasures, or of our grievances. You may think perhaps, I have no more to say; but it is not so; there yet remains that to be spoken, which may astonish you; and I will not be afraid to speak it, though you have not been ashamed to do it; for, open offences, merit not secret reproofs. I marvail, Romans, what ye mean, to send over unto us such ignorant Governours, who (I swear by the immortal Gods) neither seem to know your Laws, nor to understand ours! Ye send not those who are best able to defend us by executing Justice, but, those who are best befriended in Rome; as perhaps, you give to those of the Senate the office of Censors, more for favour or importunity, then for desert. I can say little here, in respect of what they do with us. What you authorize them to do, I know not, but what they do, is too well known unto me. All bribes that are brought unto them, they take openly, and share and poll us all in secret, to the utmost of their power. They punish the faults of poor men, and connive at rich mens transgressions, that they may take occasion and encouragement to commit greater; and whereas they should use means to diminish reproach and slanders, they encrease them. To demand Justice without a bribe, is the certain course not to obtain it. Will your Tyrannie and Avarice never have an end? Though you wrong us in words, oppress us not also in deeds. Our bodies are able to bear those irons with which you load us; but the Tributes and Taxes which you impose, are greater then we can sustain. If nothing will content you, but all that we have in Germany, go thither and take it, for we affect not, as you do, to live poorly, that we may die rich, and to deprive our selves of contentment during life, that others may squander away our superfluities when we are dead. If our service content you not, strike off our heads: for your swords are not so dreadful to our eyes, as your Image 38 (page 72) tyrannies are abominable to our hearts. Do ye know, Oh Romans, what you have done? if not, I will tell you: Verily, you have caused many of us to swear, that we will forbear to cohabit with our wives, and slay our children as soon as born, rather then leave them in the hands of such wicked and inhumane Tyrants as ye are: Yea, we determine as desperate men, to resist the natural motions of the flesh all our life time, rather then get our wives with child: thinking it better to restrain our lusting twenty or thirty years, then to leave our posterity to be your perpetual slaves. But, to what end is this complaining? Perhaps you will sometimes hear us, as now you hear me; but when you have heard us, you will be still slow in relieving. I will tell you some of those things which I have observed, that you may reform them. If a poor man come to complain and demand Justice, if he hath no money to give, nor Wine or Oyl to promise, nor a Revenue to maintain his expences nor Friends to mediate for him; then after he hath declared his grievances; you, for awhile, give him fair words, seem to pity his sufferings, and promise him speedy relief. But in the mean time make him totally spend that little which he had, and wast the best part of his life in vain hopes and tedious prosecutions, without any effect at all to his profit: Yea, on the contrary, they who at first promised him favours, do at last joyn hands with his oppressors, and quite undo him. Most say in the beginning, his cause is good, yet though upon his tryal they find it so proved, they give sentence against him at the last; so that he who came at first hither to complain against one, returns home complaining against many, yea against all, and crying out to the immortal Gods for vengeance. I will declare unto you my life, Oh Romans, that ye may understand, how we now live and subsist in my Country: I get my livelihood by gathering Acorns in the Page 73 Winter, by Fruits in the Summer, and reaping Corn: Sometimes I fish, both for pleasure, and to supply necessaries, spending most part of my time alone in Woods, Fields and Mountains, because I would not behold the outrages which are perpetrated by your Officers in our Country; whose oppressions, if I could fully declare them, would appear so many and so hainous, that either they would be deprived of their Employments, or my punishment would certainly ensue. But what good success can I hope for? When I consider the things which I have seen within these fifteen dayes now passed away since my arrival in Rome; where such things have been committed, that if they had been done in Germany, the Gallows and Gibbets had worthily hung as thick with malefactors, as Vines with clusters of Grapes? For, I have observed, (beside other things observable) such immodesty in apparrel, such intemperance in your feeding, and such disorder in your lives and affairs, that having beheld as much as I desired: and my heart being at rest, by spitting out that poyson which was in it, I am ready to make recompence for it with my head, if I have offended, &c. This, and somewhat more, which for brevity sake I omitted, was spoken in this bold manner, by a person as contemptible as this Remonstrant (to a greater and a more absolute Power then we live under) on the behalf of himself and Country-men, who were thereby oppressed, and, who, though reputed the greatest Tyrants of the world, were not so Tyrannous, as to be enraged by his upbraidings & bold expressions, whom oppression had exasperated: For, we find it attested by that famous Emperour, who occasionally related this Speech, that it was highly approved, both by the whole Senate and by him, as well becoming the Speaker, in such a case; yea, notwithstanding the tartness thereof. His testimoniall Image 39 (page 74) after he had said much in praise of this Oration, to those unto whom he declared it, was delivered in words to this effect: By the faith of a good man (said he) I saw this German stand boldly on his feet, and undismayed a whole hour, whilest all we in the Senate sate beholding the earth with shame, not able to answer him one word; because indeed he had astonished us, to see the little regard he had of his life. But, the Senate agreed altogether, (said he) the next day to send new Governours and Judges into Germany; commanded him to deliver unto us in writing all that he had said, to be registred among the good sayings of strangers; made him a Free-man of Rome; chose him to be a Senator, and appointed him a maintenance out of the common Treasury. By this, it appears, that there is a way, whereby a prudent Senate, or Supream Authority, may advance their honour, if they please, by hearing with patience and good acceptation, those bold and free speakings, tending to the execution of Justice, which Fools mis-interpret as scandalous, and tending to their dishonour or disadvantage. And the Remonstrant hath made use of these Ethnick precedents and testimonies, that they who profess Christianity, may be the more ashamed, to hear that Heathens and meer natural men should surpass them in generousness, in zeal to Justice, and in compassionately permitting grieved Supplicants boldly, plainly and openly, to signifie their grievances, and particularize their Oppressors, if need be, not only without blame, but also, with Approbation, Remedy and Reward. Here, this Remonstrant, purposed to conclude: But, as many times, he knows neither when he shall begin to write, nor what he shall write untill he hath begun: So, be knows not sometimes when he shall make an end, untill Page 75 he hath done. Whilest he was transcribing what is last added, Providence offered to his view an Epistle written by Marcus Aurelius, then Censor, to his friend Catullus, concerning the news which was at that time in Rome: Which comprehendeth so many particulars pertinent to our consideration at this present, & which have such resemblances to occurrences in this our generation, that he could not omit it: Therefore, it is here epitomized in these words, preserving the true genuine sense of that Epistle. Marcus the new Censor, to Catullus now aged, sendeth greeting. Ten dayes past I received thy Letter in the Temple of Janus, whom I take to witness, that I had rather have seen thy person. Thou desirest my Letters may be long, but shortness of time, compells me to make them shorter then I would. To answer thy expectation of knowing what news is now here, I shall not be so able as I could have been, if thou hadst desired to be informed, Whether any thing that was good and old, is yet remaining here amongst us in Rome or Italy: For, by our evil destiny, all that was good and old is ended, and new things which are evil, do now begin to abound. The Emperour, the Consuls, the Tribunes, the Senators, the Aediles, the Flamins, the Praetors, the Centurions, and almost all things are new save the Vertues, which are grown obsolet. We pass the time in making new Officers, in devising new Projects and Counsels, in raising new Taxes, with such like; and there have been more novelties within four years, then in four hundred heretofore. We now assemble three hundred to counsel in the Capitol, and there we brag and boast, swear and promise, that we will extoll the Vertuous, subdue the Vitious, favour the Right, not wink at wrongs, punish the evil, reward the good, repair the old, edifie new, pluck Vices up by the roots, plant Vertues, Image 40 (page 76) follow that which is good, reprove Tyrants, and relieve the poor and oppressed: But, when we are gone from thence, they who speak the best words, commit the worst deeds. The Senators pass away their time in saying, We will do, We will do; but, every man seeks his own profit, and forgets both private mens injuries, and the Weal-Publick. I often hear in the Senate, much eloquence in words, fair shews of zeal to Justice, and much spoken by many in justification of themselves; and when I come abroad, am ashamed to see their evil works, with their cruel extortions, and find it to be very frequent for them who commit the greatest crimes, to be most severe in giving sentence against others for the same offences. We behold our own faults in mirrours which make them seem less, and other mens in multiplying-glasses, making them appear greater. Oh! how many have I seen condemned by the Senate for one fault committed but once in all their life-time, when they themselves commit the same fault, or worse, every hour! I read, that in the time of Alexander the great, there was a famous Pirate called Dionides, who robbing all Ships he could meet withall, Alexander set forth a great Navy to apprehend him, which having taken him, and presented him to Alexander, that King said unto him, Why Dionides, dost thou spoyl so on the Seas, that no Ship can sale in safety for thee? The Pirate answered, If I spoyl by Sea, why dost thou spoyl both by Sea and Land? Oh Alexander, because I fight with one single Ship at Sea, I am called a Pirate, and because thou robbest with two hundred Ships at Sea, and troublest all the world with two hundred thousand men by Land, thou art called an Emperour. I swear unto thee Alexander, if the Gods were so favourable to me, as they are to thee, and so adverse to thee, as now they are to me, and would give me thine Empire, and bestow on Page 77 thee my little Ship, peradventure I should be a better Emperour then thou art, and thou wouldst be a worse Pirate then I. This bold speech pleased Alexander so well, that he made him General of a great Army; and he became more vertuous by Land, then he was vicious by Sea. Now, in Italy, they who rob openly, are called LORDS, and they who rob privately, are called Thieves. I read in the Annals of Livy, that there came an Embassador from Spain to Rome, to treat of a Peace with the Romans, which Embassador proved before the Senate, that he had been robbed ten times of his goods, whilest he was at Rome, and that he had seen one of those who robbed him, hang another who defended him; and that seeing so wicked a deed, he took a coal, and wrote upon the Gibbet these words. Oh Gibbet, thou art planted among thieves, art made by thieves, and hanged full of innocents. The whole history wherein these words are found, was written with black ink, and these words in Vermilion Letters. I cannot tell what other news to send thee; but every thing here is so new and tender, and joyned with such ill Cement, that I fear all will shortly fall suddenly in pieces. Some, are so hastily and so highly promoted, that I dare assure thee rather of their Fall, then of their lives and firm standing. We have already seen many, at whose rising we wondered, and as much marvelled at their sudden fall. We have seen Cincius Fulvius, in one year made Consul, his children Tribunes, his wife Matron to the Virgins, as also Keepress of the Capitol, and after that, not in one year, but the same day, saw Cincius beheaded in the place, his children drowned in Tiber, his wife banished, his house rased to the ground, and all his goods confiscate to the Common Treasury; and this rigorous example we Image 41 (page 78) have not read of in a Book, but seen with our eyes, that we might the better mind it. Sith I have begun, and thou art in a strange Country, I will write all the news which is here. This year, the 25. of May, an Embassador came out of Asia, who considering it would be dangerous sayling home in Winter; and seeing after long stay his business was not dispatched, (being a man of a good courage, and zealous of his Countries affairs) coming one day to the Senate, and seeing the Senators enter the Capitol unarmed, as the custom is, laying aside their Arms, he spake thus, in presence of all the Senators. FATHERS CONSCRIPT, I am come to Rome from a far Country, & have found Rome without Rome. The fame of the place brought me not hither, but the renown of them who govern it. I came not to see that Exchequer wherein the wealth of all Realms is treasured up, but the Sacred Senate, out of which should issue counsel for all men: I came not to see you, because you were Conquerors of other Nations, but, because I thought you were more vertuous then all other. But, I dare say, except the Gods have made me blind, or taken away my understanding, either you are not Romans of Rome, or this is not Rome of the Romans your predecessors. We have heard that the Kingdoms conquered by their valour, were conserved by the wisdom of this Senate; but methinks you are more likely to lose, then to keep what your Fathers got; For their exercise was in realities, and you consume your time in complements and vain ceremonies: I have almost killed my self with laughing at you, to see with what punctualities you leave off those Arms at the Senate gate, with which your Ancestors defended the Empire. What profit is it to your Suppliants, that you lay off those Arms which may hurt one, and put on those which destroy Page 79 all the world? What avails it us, that you enter the Senate without sword or dagger, whilest you are armed with malice in your hearts? Know, ye Romans, we dread you not, as armed Captains, but, as malitious Senators; we fear not your swords and d""ggers"

THIS present Description of a New VVorld; was made as an Appendix to my Observations upon Experimental Philosophy; and, having some Sympathy and Coherence with each other, were joyned together as Two several Worlds, at their Two Poles. But, by reason most Ladies take no delight in Philosophical Arguments, I separated some from the mentioned Observations, and caused them to go out by themselves, that I might express my Respects, in presenting to Them such Fancies as my Contemplations did afford. The First Part is Romancical; the Second, Philosophical; and the Third is meerly Fancy; or, (as I may call it) Fantastical. And if (Noble Ladies) you should chance to take pleasure in reading these Fancies, I shall account my self a Happy Creatoress: If not, I must be content to live a Melancholly Life in my own World; which I cannot call a Poor VVorld, if Poverty be only want of Image 4 (unnumbered page) Gold, and Jewels: for, there is more Gold in it, than all the Chymists ever made; or, (as I verily believe) will ever be able to make. As for the Rocks of Diamonds, I wish, with all my Soul, they might be shared amongst my Noble Female Friends; upon which condition, I would willingly quit my Part: And of the Gold, I should desire only so much as might suffice to repair my Noble Lord and Husband's Losses: for, I am not Covetous, but as Ambitious as ever any of my Sex was, is, or can be; which is the cause, That though I cannot be Henry the Fifth, or Charles the Second; yet, I will endeavour to be, Margaret the First: and, though I have neither Power, Time, nor Occasion, to be a great Conqueror, like Alexander, or Cesar; yet, rather than not be Mistress of a World, since Fortune and the Fates would give me none, I have made One of my own. And thus, believing, or, at least, hoping, that no Creature can, or will, Envy me for this World of mine, I remain, Noble Ladies, Your Humble Servant, M. NEWCASTLE.    Page 1  THE DESCRIPTION OF A NEW WORLD, CALLED The Blazing-World. A Merchant travelling into a foreign Country, fell extreamly in Love with a young Lady; but being a stranger in that Nation, and beneath her, both in Birth and Wealth, he could have but little hopes of obtaining his desire; however his Love growing more and more vehement upon him, even to the slighting of all difficulties, he resolved at last to Steal her away; which he had the better opportunity to do, because her Father's house was not far from the Sea, Image 5 (page 2) and she often using to gather shells upon the shore, accompanied not with above two or three of her servants, it encouraged him the more to execute his design. Thus coming one time with a little leight Vessel, not unlike a Packet-boat, mann'd with some few Sea-men, and well victualled, for fear of some accidents, which might perhaps retard their journey, to the place where she used to repair; he forced her away: But when he fancied himself the happiest man of the World, he proved to be the most unfortunate; for Heaven frowning at his Theft, raised such a Tempest, as they knew not what to do, or whither to steer their course; so that the Vessel, both by its own leightness, and the violent motion of the Wind, was carried as swift as an Arrow out of a Bow, towards the North-pole, and in a short time reached the Icy Sea, where the wind forced it amongst huge pieces of Ice; but being little, and leight, it did by the assistance and favour of the gods to this virtuous Lady, so turn and wind through those precipices, as if it had been guided by some experienced Pilot, and skilful Mariner: But alas! Those few men which were in it, not knowing whither they went, nor what was to be done in so strange an Adventure, and not being provided for so cold a Voyage, were all frozen to death; the young Lady onely, by the light of her Beauty, the heat of her Youth, and Protection of the Gods, remaining alive: Neither was it a wonder that the men did freeze to death; for they were not onely Page 3 driven to the very end or point of the Pole of that World, but even to another Pole of another World, which joined close to it; so that the cold having a double strength at the conjunction of those two Poles, was insupportable: At last, the Boat still passing on, was forced into another World; for it is impossible to round this Worlds Globe from Pole to Pole, so as we do from East to West; because the Poles of the other World, joining to the Poles of this, do not allow any further passage to surround the World that way; but if any one arrives to either of these Poles, he is either forced to return, or to enter into another World: and lest you should scruple at it, and think, if it were thus, those that live at the Poles would either see two Suns at one time, or else they would never want the Sun's light for six months together, as it is commonly believed: You must know, that each of these Worlds having its own Sun to enlighten it, they move each one in their peculiar Circles; which motion is so just and exact, that neither can hinder or obstruct the other; for they do not exceed their Tropicks: and although they should meet, yet we in this World cannot so well perceive them, by reason of the brightness of our Sun, which being nearer to us, obstructs the splendor of the Sun of the other World, they being too far off to be discerned by our optick perception, except we use very good Telescopes; by which, skilful Astronomers have often observed two or three Suns at once. Image 6 (page 4) But to return to the wandering Boat, and the distresed Lady; she seeing all the Men dead, found small comfort in life; their Bodies which were preserved all that while from putrefaction and stench, by the extremity of cold, began now to thaw, and corrupt; whereupon she having not strength enough to fling them over-board, was forced to remove out of her small Cabine, upon the deck, to avoid that nauseous smell; and finding the Boat swim between two plains of Ice, as a stream that runs betwixt two shores, at last perceived land, but covered all with Snow: from which came, walking upon the Ice, strange Creatures, in shape like Bears, only they went upright as men; those Creatures coming near the Boat, catched hold of it with their Paws, that served them instead of hands; some two or three of them entred first; and when they came out, the rest went in one after another; at last having viewed and observed all that was in the Boat, they spake to each other in a language which the Lady did not understand; and having carried her out of the Boat, sunk it, together with the dead men. The Lady now finding her self in so strange a place, and amongst such wonderful kind of Creatures, was extreamly strucken with fear, and could entertain no other Thoughts, but that every moment her life was to be a sacrifice to their cruelty; but those Bear-like Creatures, how terrible soever they appear'd to her sight, yet were they so far from exercising any cruelty Page 5 upon her, that rather they shewed her all civility and kindness imaginable; for she being not able to go upon the Ice, by reason of its slipperiness, they took her up in their rough arms, and carried her into their City, where instead of Houses, they had Caves under ground; and as soon as they enter'd the City, both Males and Females, young and old, flockt together to see this Lady, holding up their Paws in admiration; at last having brought her into a certain large and spacious Cave, which they intended for her reception, they left her to the custody of the Females, who entertained her with all kindness and respect, and gave her such victuals as they used to eat; but seeing her Constitution neither agreed with the temper of that Climate, nor their Diet, they were resolved to carry her into another Island of a warmer temper; in which were men like Foxes, onely walking in an upright shape, who received their neighbours the Bear-men with great civility and Courtship, very much admiring this beauteous Lady; and having discoursed some while together, agreed at last to make her a Present to the Emperor of their World; to which end, after she had made some short stay in the same place, they brought her cross that Island to a large River, whose stream run smooth and clear, like Chrystal; in which were numerous Boats, much like our Fox-traps; in one whereof she was carried, some of the Bear- and Fox-men waiting on her; and as soon as they had Image 7 (page 6) crossed the River, they came into an Island where there were Men which had heads, beaks, and feathers, like wild-Geese, onely they went in an upright shape, like the Bear-men and Fox-men: their rumps they carried between their legs, their wings were of the same length with their Bodies, and their tails of an indifferent size, trailing after them like a Ladie's Garment; and after the Bear- and Fox-men had declared their intention and design to their Neighbours, the Geese-or Bird-men, some of them joined to the rest, and attended the Lady through that Island, till they came to another great and large River, where there was a preparation made of many Boats, much like Birds nests, onely of a bigger size; and having crost that River, they arrived into another Island, which was of a pleasant and mild temper, full of Woods and the Inhabitants thereof were Satyrs, who received both the Bear- Fox- and Bird-men, with all respect and civility; and after some conferences (for they all understood each others language) some chief of the Satyrs joining to them, accompanied the Lady out of that Island to another River, wherein were many handsome and commodious Barges; and having crost that River, they entered into a large and spacious Kingdom, the men whereof were of a Grass-Green Complexion, who entertained them very kindly, and provided all conveniences for their further voyage: hitherto they had onely crost Rivers, but now they Page 7 could not avoid the open Seas any longer; wherefore they made their Ships and tacklings ready to sail over into the Island, where the Emperor of the Blazing-world (for so it was call'd) kept his residence. Very good Navigators they were; and though they had no knowledg of the Load-stone, or Needle, or pendulous Watches, yet (which was as serviceable to them) they had subtile observations, and great practice; in so much that they could not onely tell the depth of the Sea in every place, but where there were shelves of Sand, Rocks, and other obstructions to be avoided by skilful and experienced Sea-men: Besides, they were excellent Augurers, which skill they counted more necessary and beneficial then the use of Compasses, Cards, Watches, and the like; but, above the rest, they had an extraordinary Art, much to be taken notice of by Experimental Philosophers, and that was a certain Engin, which would draw in a great quantity of Air, and shoot forth Wind with a great force; this Engine in a calm, they placed behind their Ships, and in a storm, before; for it served against the raging waves, like Cannons against an hostile Army, or besieged Town; it would batter and beat the waves in pieces, were they as high as Steeples; and as soon as a breach was made, they forced their passage through, in spight even of the most furious wind, using two of those Engins at every Ship, one before, to beat off the waves, and another behind to drive it on; so that the artificial wind had the Image 8 (page 8) better of the natural; for, it had a greater advantage of the waves, then the natural of the Ships: the natural being above the face of the Water, could not without a down right motion enter or press into the Ships; whereas the artificial with a sideward-motion, did pierce into the bowels of the Waves: Moreover, it is to be observed, that in a great Tempest they would join their Ships in battel-aray: and when they feared Wind and Waves would be too strong for them, if they divided their Ships; they joined as many together as the compass or advantage of the places of the Liquid Element would give them leave. For, their Ships were so ingeniously contrived, that they could fasten them together as close as a Honey-comb, without waste of place; and being thus united, no Wind nor Waves were able to separate them. The Emperor's Ships, were all of Gold; but the Merchants and Skippers, of Leather; the Golden Ships were not much heavier then ours of Wood, by reason they were neatly made, and required not such thickness, neither were they troubled with Pitch, Tar, Pumps, Guns, and the like, which make our Woodden-Ships very heavy; for though they were not all of a piece, yet they were so well sodder'd, that there was no fear of Leaks, Chinks, or Clefts; and as for Guns, there was no use of them, because they had no other enemies but the Winds: But the Leather Ships were not altogether so sure, although much leighter; besides, they were pitched to keep out Water. Page 9 Having thus prepar'd, and order'd their Navy, they went on in despight of Calm or Storm: And though the Lady at first fancied her self in a very sad condition, and her mind was much tormented with doubts and fears, not knowing whether this strange Adventure would tend to her safety or destruction; yet she being withal of a generous spirit, and ready wit, considering what dangers she had past, and finding those sorts of men civil and diligent attendants to her, took courage, and endeavoured to learn their language; which after she had obtained so far, that partly by some words and signs she was able to apprehend their meaning, she was so far from being afraid of them, that she thought her self not onely safe, but very happy in their company: By which we may see, that Novelty discomposes the mind, but acquaintance settles it in peace and tranquillity. At last, having passed by several rich Islands and Kingdoms, they went towards Paradise, which was the seat of the Emperor; and coming in sight of it, rejoiced very much; the Lady at first could perceive nothing but high Rocks, which seemed to touch the Skies; and although they appear'd not of an equal heigth, yet they seemed to be all one piece, without partitions: but at last drawing nearer, she perceived a clift, which was a part of those Rocks, out of which she spied coming forth a great number of Boats, which afar off shewed like a company of Ants, marching one after another; the Boats appeared like the holes or Image 9 (page 10) partitions in a Honey-comb, and when joined together, stood as close; the men were of several Complexions, but none like any of our World; and when both the Boats and Ships met, they saluted and spake to each other very courteously; for there was but one language in all that World: nor no more but one Emperor, to whom they all submitted with the greatest duty and obedience, which made them live in a continued Peace and Happiness; not acquainted with Foreign Wars, or Home-bred Insurrections. The Lady now being arrived at this place, was carried out of her Ship into one of those Boats, and conveighed through the same passage (for there was no other) into that part of the World where the Emperor did reside; which part was very pleasant, and of a mild temper: Within it self it was divided by a great number of vast and large Rivers, all ebbing and flowing, into several Islands of unequal distance from each other, which in most parts were as pleasant, healthful, rich, and fruitful, as Nature could make them; and, as I mentioned before, secure from all Foreign Invasions, by reason there was but one way to enter, and that like a Labyrinth, so winding and turning among the Rocks, that no other Vessels but small Boats, could pass, carrying not above three passengers at a time: On each side all along this narrow and winding River, there were several Cities, some of Marble, some of Alabaster, some of Agat, some of Amber, some of Coral, and some of other Page 11 precious materials not known in our world; all which after the Lady had passed, she came to the Imperial City, named Paradise, which appeared in form like several Islands; for, Rivers did run betwixt every street, which together with the Bridges, whereof there was a great number, were all paved. The City it self was built of Gold; and their Architectures were noble, stately, and magnificent, not like our Modern, but like those in the Romans time; for, our Modern Buildings are like those Houses which Children use to make of Cards, one story above another, fitter for Birds, then Men; but theirs were more Large, and Broad, then high; the highest of them did not exceed two stories, besides those rooms that were under-ground, as Cellars, and other Offices. The Emperor's Palace stood upon an indifferent ascent from the Imperial City; at the top of which ascent was a broad Arch, supported by several Pillars, which went round the Palace, and contained four of our English miles in compass: within the Arch stood the Emperor's Guard, which consisted of several sorts of Men; at every half mile, was a Gate to enter, and every Gate was of a different fashion; the first, which allowed a passage from the Imperial City into the Palace, had on either hand a Cloyster, the outward part whereof stood upon Arches sustained by Pillars, but the inner part was close: Being entred through the Gate, the Palace it self appear'd in its middle like the Isle of a Church, a mile and Image 10 (page 12) a half long, and half a mile broad; the roof of it was all Arched, and rested upon Pillars, so artificially placed that a stranger would lose himself therein without a Guide; at the extream sides, that is, between the outward and inward part of the Cloyster, were Lodgings for Attendants; and in the midst of the Palace, the Emperor's own Rooms; whose Lights were placed at the top of every one, because of the heat of the Sun: the Emperor's appartment for State was no more inclosed then the rest; onely an Imperial Throne was in every appartment, of which the several adornments could not be perceived until one entered, because the Pillars were so just opposite to one another, that all the adornments could not be seen at one. The first part of the Palace was, as the Imperial City, all of Gold; and when it came to the Emperors appartment, it was so rich with Diamonds, Pearls, Rubies, and the like precious Stones, that it surpasses my skill to enumerate them all. Amongst the rest, the Imperial Room of State appear'd most magnificent; it was paved with green Diamonds (for there are in that World Diamonds of all Colours) so artificially, as it seemed but of one piece; the Pillars were set with Diamonds so close, and in such a manner, that they appear'd most Glorious to the sight; between every Pillar was a Bow or Arch of a certain sort of Diamonds, the like whereof our World does not afford; which being placed in every one of the Arches in several rows, seemed just like so many Rainbows Page 13 of several different colours. The roof of the Arches was of blew Diamonds, and in the midst thereof was a Carbuncle, which represented the Sun; and the Rising and Setting-Sun at the East and West-side of the Room were made of Rubies. Out of this Room there was a passage into the Emperor's Bed-Chamber, the Walls whereof were of Jet, and the Floor of black Marble; the Roof was of Mother of Pearl, where the Moon and Blazing-Stars were represented by white Diamonds, and his Bed was made of Diamonds and Carbuncles. No sooner was the Lady brought before the Emperor, but he conceived her to be some Goddess, and offered to worship her; which she refused, telling him, (for by that time she had pretty well learned their Language) that although she came out of another world, yet was she but a mortal. At which the Emperor rejoycing, made her his Wife, and gave her an absolute power to rule and govern all that World as she pleased. But her subjects, who could hardly be perswaded to believe her mortal, tender'd her all the Veneration and Worship due to a Deity. Her Accoustrement after she was made Empress, was as followeth: On her head she wore a Cap of Pearl, and a Half-moon of Diamonds just before it; on the top of her Crown came spreading over a broad Carbuncle, cut in the form of the Sun; her Coat was of Pearl, mixt with blew Diamonds, and frindged Image 11 (page 14) with red """""""""" her Buskins and Sandals were of green Diamond8 letters	 left hand she held a Buckler"

MY LORD, I Question not, but This Essay will be more kindly Received, for having Your Name Image 5 (unnumbered page) prefixt to It; since That is so much honour'd for Your great Services to the Publick, and signal Loyalty to His present Majesty: And all Persons must needs therefore greatly esteem Your Merit, Courage, and Experience in Military Affairs; since the KING hath manifested His Approbation of Them, by the Great and Honourable Trusts conferr'd upon You. My Lord, I will give You a few Instances of the Design and Usefulness of these Papers; that I may Image 6 (unnumbered page) obtain Your Protection against those morose Men, who endeavour to oppose this New �ndertaking, tho' they cannot but acknowledge, that they approve of It. The Design of This Essay, is, To vindicate the Art of Curing Diseases, from the common Scandal of being Conjectural, by Describing the Tastes and Odors of Medicines, and also of Animal Humours: For by These, Medicines were first discover'd, and the Humors of the Body examin'd; and from the Image 7 (unnumbered page) Observation of the Agreement and Contrarieties betwixt the Taste of Humours in the Body, and the Medicine, it was easie for Physicians to infer, That by a Medicine of the same Taste, the Humours of the Body are Preserv'd; and by the contrary Taste in the Medicine, they are Alter'd and Corrected. These are the true Fundamental Rules of Physick, built on the Testimony of our Senses, and not on the Whims of Chymists, or the Fanaticisms of Occult Qualities; by Image 8 (unnumbered page) which Medicines work, like Charms, insensibly. Hence Quacks give to their Medicines very many, and too unreasonable Commendations: They also pretend to an Experience of a particular Medicine, as well as the best Physician. But 'tis only the Taste and Smell of the Medicine, by which its Vertue must be try'd betwixt the Physician, & the Quack: By these the true Physician knoweth its Vertue, the Manner of its Preparation, the Suitableness of it to the Humour to be Corrected, Image 9 (unnumbered page) and to the Constitution of the Patient: Of all which the Quack is ignorant. When the several Compositions of Tastes, and sometimes Odors, in the same Plant, are well consider'd by those who shall read the Descriptions I have given of them, I question not, but that the Artificial Jumbles of many Medicines together, will be Rejected; and every Ingenuous Practicer will chiefly make use of Simple Medicines; by which his Patient will be more Image 10 (unnumbered page) suddenly, safely, and pleasantly Cured. I have further propos'd some Notions about Tastes in general, for the easier discovering of the Nature of such Plants, as grow common in England. I have mention'd Those I have met with near Litchfield: And I have added Exoticks; that by comparing the Tastes and Vertues of both, we might the better understand Those of Our own. It is a great Shame to our Profession, that the Ignorant Indians should know more of Image 11 (unnumbered page) Plants in their Native Country, and do greater Cures by Them, than our Artists can by Ours. I thought it absurd to write a Latin Discourse about English Plants; which is design'd for the Use of English Men, who are further to try and examine the Tastes and Vertues that I have mention'd. Hippocrates & Galen wrote their Physical Books in the Language of the Country where they Practiced: And the Learn'd Mr. Boyl hath both Honour'd and Improv'd our Language, Image 12 (unnumbered page) by his Physical Discourses in English. I have therefore wrote in English, that I might the more encourage our Country-Men to enquire into the Vertue of our Native Plants; we being hitherto oblig'd to our Old English Herbals, for a Collection of the Vertues of many Plants from the Country-Men; to whose Sagacity & Experiments the greatest Physicians are hitherto obliged. And since there have been so many false Commedations given of Medicines, and mistaken Notions of Image 13 (unnumbered page) Physick, I thought it reasonable to give my Country-Men some Advertisements of these Abuses, and to enable them to a better Judgment of the right Nature of Physick. By the Instances I have given, I hope I have convinc'd Your Lordship of the great Usefulness of this Essay; and presume, All who have a generous Love for their Country, will pardon the Fault (if it be One) of Writing in English. I here Present Your Lordship with the first Fruits Image 14 (unnumbered page) of my Studies, as an humble Acknowledgment of Your great Favors to Me; and that I might make this Publick Declaration of My being, My LORD, Your Lordship's most Faithful Humble Servant, JOHN FLOYER.   Image 15 (unnumbered page) TO THE READER. THE famous Effects of the Cortex Peruvianus, in Curing of Agues, gave Me the first Occasion of inquiring into the Tastes of the Barks of Trees in our own Country; that I might find, which were like it: And from thence I proceeded to enquire into the Tastes of Herbs, for these Three or Four Years last past. I had then no other Herbal by Me, but Mr. Ray's Catalogue of English Plants: From whence I took the Names of Plants, and the Method of placing Them in an Alphabetical Order by Themselves: But because I could not meet with all He mentions, I resolv'd to supply that Defect from our Country-Gardens, and Apothecaries Shops, where I tasted some Plants that were Dry and Old. The Vertues of Those in the Shops being more experimented and known, I thought by Image 16 (unnumbered page) Them the better to understand our Country-Herbs: And when I had tasted, and set down the Tastes and Odors of those Plants, I perceiv'd it was easie for Me to give an Account of their Vertues Collected by Dioscorides, Scroder, Etmuller, Mr. Ray, and Others. By the Reading of Hippocrates, Dioscorides, and Galen, I found that the Antients had the same Way of finding out the Vertues of Plants by their Taste and Smell: Wbich is most evident in Galen's Books of the Nature of Simple Medicines; where I found the Tastes and Odors of many Plants Described, as I have done; which gave Me a great Satisfaction, when I found my Taste to agree with Theirs of former Ages; which I had not read till I had finisht my Descriptions of Tastes and Odors. This Summer I visited the Famous Physick-Garden at Chelsey, in which I found a great Number of curious Plants; but have not given the Tastes of above Forty or Fifty, my Affairs not permitting Me to go above twice. I was pleas'd with many Curiosities There, which the Ingenuous and obliging Mr. Watts shew'd Me; especially the Tree which bears the Jesuits Bark. We observ'd a Turpentine in it; and not the Laurel-Bitter Taste, evident in ordinary Bark. I have since observ'd a Turpentine-Smell in the Image 17 (unnumbered page) fresh Young Leaves of Laurel and Walnut; and also of Black Currains, and some Others. The Leaves of the Tree mention'd, were then very Young; and the Taste could not then be so certainly describ'd, as it may be in the midst of Summer: But the Taste of the Bark would best discover the Specifick Taste and Juyce of that Tree. I very much admire Mr. Watts's Ingenuity, in ordering his Plants into a Method for Learners; and in his Artificial Heats for the more early Ripening of Fruit. His Taste and Smell did very much agree with Mine; and did readily acknowledge my right Classing of many Plants. I was also obliged to the Company of Dr. Baynard, and Dr. Betts, Junior; who tasted some Plants at Chelsey with Me, and concurr'd also in the Description of their Tastes and Smells. I have not wholly trusted to my own Taste, in the Description of our Country Herbs, but have consulted the Tastes of all sorts of Persons; and for that am oblig'd to divers Divines, Apothecaries, Chyrurgeons, Gentlewomen, and Young Persons, who have been my Patients; whose Judgments, as Galen says, is �ncorrupt and �nprejudic'd. I must needs acknowledge, that the Palats of Women are more Critical than Men's, who generally dull it by Intemperance and Tobacco. Image 18 (unnumbered page)  I shall readily Retract any Error I have committed; but advise the Reader, not too confidently to conclude my Mistake on the sudden: For it did require a long Experience in Tastes, before I could distinguish many Compositions, and how to express Them; and I took notice, that by tasting many Things together, I could distinguish nothing. When I had Collected my Tastes and Smells,I found it necessary to Collect the known Vertues out of Dioscorides, Mr. Ray, and other Authors; that I might give an Account of those Vertues by their Taste and Smell: All which are mention'd in the Second Part of this Essay, which was first wrote; and out of which I made the Notions about Tastes and Smells in general. So that if any Assertion be obscure, for want of Instances, in the First Part, you may find Them in the Second; and if the Reason of the Vertue doth not appear clearly in the Taste given in the Second Part, consult the Taste in general in the First. I added the Tastes of Resins, Gums, and Turpentines in the Third Part; because they are the Oyly Specifick Juyces of Plants. Because Plants grow amongst Minerals, and are at last turn'd into an Animal Substance, I thought fit to add what I knew of their Tastes; that thence the Tastes, Nature, Image 19 (unnumbered page) and Vertues of Vegetables might be better explain'd. The Tastes of Animal Humours were long since observ'd by Hippocrates:  in non-Latin alphabet 	. Hip. de Prisca Medicina. For there is in Man, a Bitter, a Salt, a Sweet, a Tart, an Acerb, an Insipid, and a Thousand more; which have all manner of Faculties. I have reduc'd, in the Fourth Part, Medicines into Specifick Classes; and distinguisht the several Specificks by their Tastes, that Physicians might more readily find what Taste is necessary for the Correcting of particular Humours. In the Fifth Part I have reduc'd Plants into the Summa Genera, by these Eight Tastes, being All, but the First, the Tastes of the Specifick Juyces of Plants; (viz.) Earthy, Mucilaginous, Sweet, Bitter, Aromatick, Fetid, Acrid, Corrosive; (Acids will not make a Class different from Astringents, neither of them being the Taste of any Specifick Juyce.) These Image 20 (unnumbered page) Summa Genera are sub-divided into Species, by their several Compositions of Tastes, or a particular distinguishing Smell. I might have added some particular External Accidents of either Seed, Leaf, Root, or Flower, for the Distinction of the Individuals in each Species: But for That I shall referr the Reader to Mr. Ray's Catalogus Plantarum nova, or his History of Plants; where he may read a full Collection of all the Accidents of Plants, and find a great many Tastes collected by him. Which excellent Book came not to my Hands, till the greatest Part of my Book was transcrib'd; and since, I have read it, and given some Account of the Vertues There mention'd by him. I hope, I shall make it manifest, in the ensuing Discourse, that there is no Vertue yet known in Plants, but what depends on the Taste and Smell, and may be known by them. This was, certainly, the Foundation, on which the old Physicians rais'd the Art of Physick; but they were strangely led from it by Aristotle's Philosophy, which taught them to express the Vertues of Medicines, by Hot, Cold, Moist, and Dry; to which, and to Occult Qualities, they attributed all Effects, neglecting the Information of their Senses. But We have now more Advantages, Image 21 (unnumbered page) than the former Ages. By Chymistry we distinguish the Principles which produce each Taste: And the Learn'd Mr. Boyl hath given us a clear and satisfactory Account of Qualities. The Famous Malpighius, and Ingenious Dr. Grew, have discover'd the several Vessels of Plants; and the Last hath given us his Curious Reflections upon Tastes. From the Famous Anatomists of our Age, Harvey, Willis, Lower, Needham, Glisson, &c. we have a clearer Description of the Vessels, Viscera, and Humours of Animals, than was known to former Ages. All which Improvements I found very useful to Me, in the Explication of the Vertues of Medicines by their Tastes: And therefore I ought, here, to acknowledge it, not having leisure to make particular Quotations. I hope, the Reader will hereby be excited to promote the further Descriptions of Tastes; without which, the Nature of a Medicine, nor the Manner of its Operation, cannot be understood: And let us not confine our selves to Five Empirical Medicines, since there are such Varieties of Tastes; and every Taste hath as certain an Effect, as the Laurel-Bitter in the Jesuits Powder, if we use it in its due Time, Place, and Quantity. The chief Business of a Physician, being to chuse, and apply Tastes, and not to compound Medicines; Image 22 (unnumbered page) for That is done by Nature it self: For in those Medicines We call Simple, there are divers Compounded Tastes. I suppose, there is some Fear upon Physians, that they should do Themselves some Injury; and therefore have been discourag'd from Tasting: But, I hope, it will be consider'd, how disingenuous it is in some Physicians, who cause their Patients to Swallow, what they dare not Taste Themselves. The Corrosive and Narcotick Plants may be warily Tasted; and though some of Them will, by being Tasted, get into the Stomach, yet a little can do no Harm. It is true, that Gesner Poyson'd himself; but it was by taking Two Drachms of Doronicum-Root, and not by tasting of it only. I cannot believe, I have receiv'd any Prejudice by Tasting, though I have oft blister'd my Mouth, and disorder'd my Stomach. I hope� the Candid Reader will pardon those Faults which have happen'd in these Papers, by my Distance from the Press, and the many long and frequent Interruptions� I have had by a Country-Practice, and ill Health; which have hindred the making of some Corrections, that should have been made both in the Style and Method of the following Book.

Image 25 (page 1) A Phytological Essay, &c.  The First Part. Of Tastes in general.  CHAP. I. The Division of Tastes into Simple and Compound. THE Organ of Taste is curiously described by Malpighius, to be certain Nervous Papillae, placed upon the Tongue, and about the Mouth and Throat; which are affected differently in every sort of Taste. Dr. Willis affirms, That Gustatus is Quaedam Image 26 (page 2) quasi tactus species, depending on the different Figures of Bodies; which, by the different Texture and Motion, produce diverse Affections, Alterations, or Modes of Tastes on the Organ: As Soft, Hard, Moist, Dry, Smooth and Rough; Grateful, as Sweetness; Ungrateful, as Bitterness Greetiness, and Unctuousness; Cool, Hot, or Temperate; Sharp, Corroding; Salt, Slimy, or Astringent; Contracting the Lips, and Choaking; Vesicating, Exuleerating; Pungent, Penetrant; Aromatick, Fetid, or Abominable; Nauseous, Detergent; Burning in the Throat, Pricking in the Mouth by rough Leaves: And divers other Modes might be added to these. According to this Consideration, no Plant has any Simple Taste; but produces different Modes: Neither have the most Simple Principles of Plants one Simple Mode or Affection, but two or more depending on their Motion and Texture. Acids have a different and less Agitation of Parts, than the Organ; and therefore they taste Cool; and by their Angular Figure or Edges, they are Pungent. Water cools and moistens by the Globular Figure of its Particles; and by their less Agitation, than the Organ of an Animal. Image 27 (page 3)  Oyl of Plants is of a congruous Temper or Heat; and by the ramose or viscous Parts, is slimy, and of a smooth Taste. Earthy Plants are greety, hard and dry in Taste, from the Solidity and unequal Particles of Earth. In distinguishing of Simple and Compounded Tastes of Plants, I do chiefly consider the different Textures and Motion of the Original Principles, as producing Simple Tastes; and not the different Modes of Taste. Therefore, because these Four, Earth, Water, Acid, and Oyl, are the Original Principles of Plants, out of which some other Compositions are immediately made; as Salts, Gums, Turpentines and Mucilages, &c. and because these have a determinate Texture and Motion, whereby they produce some certain Modes of Taste; I think fit to call these Four Tastes, (viz.) Watry, Earthy, Oyly, and Acid, The only Simple Tastes in Plants. And where any Taste depends on diverse Principles, that Taste is justly esteem'd Compound; having a certain Texture, and Motion, resulting from the Composition of the different Textures, and Agitation of the Principles; which produce a different Taste in Composition, from the Taste of any Principle. Image 28 (page 4)  Compound Tastes (consider'd as particular  Textures of Plants) arising from some of the Four Principles of Plants, are, 1. Bitter, which is compounded of Oyl, Acid and Earth; having an unequal Texture; detergent, unpleasant: Compar'd by Dr. Willis, to the Head of a Teasle or Brush. 2. Astringents are compounded of Acid and Earth; having a roughness in Texture, contracting and exasperating. 3. Mucilaginous is compounded chiefly of Oyl, Acid and Water; and of a smooth Texture, cooling and moistening. 4. Tungent is compounded of an Oyly-Acid, and with some Earth, united, by Fermentation, into Volatile Salts; or, by Fusion in the Fire, into Fixt Salts; both of which taste Salt, Pungent, Penetrant, Drying, from their long sharp-pointed Figures. 5. Sweet is compounded of a Rarefy'd, and well-digested Oyl, and Acid; whereby it is of a smooth Texture, grateful, and easily convertible into Bitter; having the same Principles, by the Alteration of the Texture only. Note, I do not find any Saltness naturally Image 29 (page 5) and considerable in Plants; but only externally, from the Sea-Water: And therefore, do not reckon That a Taste amongst Plants, because the Natural Salt of Plants tastes only Pungent. Diverse Tastes are compounded of a Simple  Taste, and a Compound: As, 1. Acrid is compounded of a little Oyl, and a great deal of Salt; being Hot, Pungent, and Burning. 2. Acerbs are compounded of Acid and Astringent; being partly of Angular, and partly of a rough Figure. Tastes arising from Compounded Tastes  mixed, are, 1. Nauseous, which is compounded of Bitter-sweet, or Bitter-slimy; and of a Texture deterging and smoothing. 2. Austeres are compounded of Bitterish and Astringent; and are of a very rough Texture. 3. Nitrose is compounded of Cool and Bitter: Plants of this Taste are Watry, Slimy, and Bitterish; as Beets. Image 30 (page 6)  Tastes compounded of other Compound  Tastes, and a particular Smell, are, 1. Aromaticks, which are compounded of Acrids, Bitterish or Sweet, with a Fragrant Smell. 2. Fetid Tastes are compounded of Bitter, Acrid or Mucilaginous Tastes; with a Fetid Smell. 3. Cress-Tastes are compounded of a Bitterish and Acrid Taste, and a quick Pungent Smell, which flies from the Tongue into the Nose; as Mustard-seed, &c. And we find many Plants Tasting as they Smell. To describe the different Affections of the Organ by Taste, I think unnecessary: For the Eyes know particular Colours, without discerning and distinguishing the manner of their Impression; and by the Feeling, we know many Things, though we distinguish not all the Qualities we feel: So the Taste, whose Sense is like the touching of an Object, knows (Watry, Earthy, Acid, Greety, Astringent, Mucilaginous, Oyly, Bitter, Sweet, Resinous, Gummy, Terebinthinate, Aromatick, Abominable, Pungent, Corrosive, Hot and Cool, Crude, Mellowy, Nauseous Tastes, and Pea-Tastes) immediately, without considering the particular Image 31 (page 7) Mode by which they affect. And because these are the common known Tastes, out of which other Tastes are made; therefore these respectively may be call'd Simple Tastes, because the Compound Tastes of Plants are produc'd by a Mixture of these. And these Compound Tastes are observable, either in the same Liquor; as in Turpentine, Bitter, Slimy and Acrid may be Tasted; and in many Milks of Plants, Bitter, Acrid and Gumminess: Or else the Compounded Tastes are lodg�d in different Vessels and Liquors; as in the Lymphaticks, is a sweet Lympha; in the Muciducts, a Mucilage; in the Lactiferous Vessels, a Milk, which is either Bitter-Acrid, or Bitter-Smoaky, or Sweet; in the Balsam Vessels, a Turpentine; in the Parenchymous Parts of Plants, a crude Juyce; in the Ligneous Parts, a Lympha; in the Skins of Fruits, and the Stones and Seed, a different Taste from the Juyce of the Pulpy Part. The Roots, Stalks, Leaves, and Fruit of some Plants, have their different Tastes from the different Digestion, Mixture, Texture and Colature of the Juyces of those Plants� in their several Parts.   Image 32 (page 8) CHAP. II. Of the Virtues of Tastes, and the Principles by which they are produced. IF we use the Testimony of our Senses for the discovery of the Principles or Ingredients, out of which the Juyces of Plants, by different Mixtures, are produc'd; they will inform us of Earthy, Watry, Oyly, and Acid Principles; and a Pungency, which is a Salt. Earthy Parts are in Mosses and Woods;  from whence arise dry Tastes. Water in all Plants; which is sufficiently  evident in Distillations of them, and in their Juyces. The Watry Part is supplied by Rain and Dew; whose great quantity this Year, (1685.) has made many Plants prodigiously great: But in the two last dry Years, the want of them either dwarft them in their Growth, or hindred their Production, or preserved them not sufficiently from the scorching Heat. This is Image 33 (page 9) the Vehicle of the other Principles, in which the Acid swims readily, as also the Pungent Particles, and combine together; as Acid and Alcali: In this the Oyls are mixed, by means of the Acid and Earth. From these Two Principles of Plants, these following Tastes arise: From much Earth in Plants arise, First,  A dry Earthy Taste, as in Mosses; Secondly, A Woody Taste, as in Trees and Barks. From much Water mixt with Earth and  Acid, arises a crude or raw Taste, as in Spinach, Chick-weed, &c. From much Water mixt with Acid and  Oyl, or from smooth Oyly-Earthy Parts, like Marle, or Bole diluted, and some Acid, arises a Mucilaginous Taste; which I refer to the Watry Tastes, because Water most abounds in it.   Image 34 (page 10) CHAP. III. Concerning Mucilages. THat Mucilages in Plants depend on the Oyl much diluted, is manifest from the following Instances. Linseed affords an Oyl by Expression, and a Mucilage in Decoction. Almonds afford an Oyl by Expression, and a slimy Mucilaginous Milk in Emulsions. Poppies are very Mucilaginous, and contain an Oyl, as appears by a Milky Juyce; and an Oyl is pressed out of Poppy-seeds. Henbane smells Oyly, and is Mucilaginous, and feels Oyly, and Clammy; and the Seed yields an Oyl by Expression. These Plants that smell of a rank Oyl, as Goss-Flowers, and most of the Pea-Taste, are Mucilaginous: So that from these Instances, I may infer, that a crude Oyl diluted well with Water, makes a Mucilage; which may be farther proved by the effects of a Mucilage, compared with the effects of Oyl. Mucilages cause a smoothness in the Palat, and outwardly are Emollients, as Oyls Image 35 (page 11) be, and ripen Imposthumes; inwardly they are more cool than Oyl, though of a congruous Nature: They defend the Throat from the sharpness of Rheums; the Stomach from corrosive Humours or Medicines; the Ureters from sharp Cholerick or Acid Urine; and smooth the passages for the Stony Gravel; they cool the hot scorbutick Blood, by their crude and ropy Parts, stop its violent Motion, and inviscate its Acrid Saline Particles. Oyls have a Mucilage joyned with them. I distill'd some Gum-Arabick in an open Fire, and in an Earthen Retort, and found an Acid Spirit of a smoaky Smell, and a good quantity of Oyl; but the Earthy parts exceeded all, Gum-Arabick being a clammy Mucilage. But I cannot but think the Mucilage in Comphrey, which tastes as if Meal and Water were mixed together, depends upon a mixture of some Farinaceous Parts, which are the immediate Causes of Mucilages, (which Farinaceous Particles are resolvible into Oyl and Water chiefly, and have the same Principles as other Mucilages) and which are proper nourishment for the Parenchymous Parts of Plants: These being in plenty mixed with Water, cause a slimy Slipperiness, observable by rubbing in the Image 36 (page 12) Fingers, as well as by the Taste: Such is the Mucilage in Althaea, Mallows, Typha, &c. which also being dryed to Powder, produce a sort of Mealy Powder. All the Farinaceous Plants, as Barley, Oats, Wheat, do yield an Oyl. And Bonetus gives us an Instance of Roots of Althaea, which applied in the form of a Pultis, raised Blisters; and Comphrey-Roots discuss Gouty Tumors: So that these crude Mucilages have more Volatile parts frequently mixed with them. Those diversities of Taste that arise from Mucilage Compounded, are either Cool or Hot.  �. I. Cool Mucilages, With much Water, called the Watry  Mucilages, as in Purslain, &c. these have the effects above described, being the most Simple Mucilages. The Earthy Mucilages, such as in Mushrooms;  and these repel, and cool Inflammations outwardly. If the Water be little, the Mucilage is  thick, gummose, clammy, or Mealy; as in Comphrey, and Watery Gums: They stop Fluxes, and correct sharp Humours.   Image 37 (page 13) �. II. Hot Mucilages. Mucilages with a rank Oyly Smell, as in  Goss-Flowers, and the Pea-Taste, are proper for Anodyne Oyntments. Mucilages with an Aromatick Smell, either  in Leaves or Flowers, as in Erigerum, and the Lily-kind: These Mealy Mucilages, with a Lily-Smell, digest, ripen and suppurate Tumors. The Bitter Mucilages outwardly soften,  and discuss inwardly; are Vomiters and Purgers, being the truest Character of Nauseousness in Plants. Mucilages with Pungency Acrid, as in  Lysimachia; and these are properly Diureticks: By the Mucilage, they smooth the passages of Urine; and by their Acrid Salt, they dissolve Acid Tartareous Concretions in the Kidneys. Mucilages with a Narcotick Smell, by  their hot Narcotick Parts discuss, and allay pains; by their Mucilages, they soften and are Arodyne. Image 38 (page 14)  Mucilages with Astringency, have their  Taste from the different parts of Plants; as in Plantane-Seeds, the Husk is Astringent, the Pulpy part of the Seed Mucilaginous.    CHAP. IV. Concerning Acid in Plants. THE Third Principle our Senses discover in Plants, is Acid; perceivable by Taste and Smell, in Sorrel, &c. This seems to affect the Taste with a cool Sharpness, not unlike the Spirit of Sulphur; and is probably supplied Vide Sulph. from the Mineral Kingdom: This Acid has not the Bitterishness of Nitre, nor the Saltness of common Salt, nor a Vitriolate Relish from any Mineral; but is pure cool Acid. The Crystals of Tartar are sowre. Vide Tartar amongst Salts. Crystals of Wood-Sorrel are also sowre, like Tartar: The Essential Salts of Plants differ not from Tartar. Vinegar is more Spirituous than the former, being a Winy Subacid Liquor. Image 39 (page 15)  The Acid is obvious in the most bitter Plants, as in Extracts of Worm-wood and Horehound, and in all Extracts: In the Plant they are not perceived, because of the Strength of the Bitterness that affects the Palat most; though the Acids temper the Bitter, and the Bitter the Acid. Acids are never alter'd in the Plant, so as to lose their Nature, though they undergo divers Mixtures; but when they are reduc'd into Volatile Salts, by being compounded with Oyl and Earth. Acids mixt with much Water, are the  purest Acids. Acids mixt with a little Water, and much  Earth, produce an Astringent Taste. Acids with Water and Earth more loosly  mixt, produce a rough Taste; as in Sloes, which is a greater degree of Astringency: And in this Taste the Acid and Earth are in equal quantity. The Fourth Acid Composition is Acid  Oleose, as in Terebinthinates; and these always have an Astringency joyn'd to the Bitterness, which arises from the Oyl and Acid in Turpentine. Image 40 (page 16)  Dr. Grew asserts, That many stillatitious Oyls, digested with any strong Acid, will acquire a bitter Taste: And therefore, Myrrhe, Gentian, and all bitter Gums distilled, yield Acid Liquors. I shall hereafter deduce the Bitterness of Plants immediately from Turpentine; but remotely from the mixture of Oyl and Acid. Acid-Acrid, as in Rosa Solis; In these  the Volatile and Acid combine. And since Rosa Solis is accounted a Caustick, 'tis probable, other Caustick Plants may have the same mixture. These are proper for Treacle-Water to cool by their Acid, and sweat with their hot Parts, or to provoke �rine. Mixed Salts, and hot Herbs, tempered by the mixture of Acid, are profitable in Fevers. Acid sweet, such as in all Ripe Fruits, as  Cherries, ripe Grapes; these make the Acid more easie to the Stomach, and less fretting, as in Spiritus Salis Dulcis: These excite Appetite, and cool the Blood. Acid and Bitter; these promote �rine,  as in Alkakengi-berries, and Quicky-berries, and have an Anti-Febrile vertue from Acid and Bitter; as in Bezoardick mixtures, which are Bitter-Acid. Image 41 (page 17)  The Effects of Acids in the Body are to coagulate, and fix Choler, and the Volatile Salts in the Blood, by uniting with the Salt, and rendring them like common Sal Ammoniack; and so Acids become Diuretick; as also, by dissolving the gritty Matter of the Stone, and mixing with it, by coagulating the Serum of the Blood; as Serum Sanguinis turns white by the mixture of the Spirit of Nitre, and by thickning its Consistence, which is a less degree of Coagulation. Acids hinder the rarefaction of the Blood, and its Extravasation; as also, all Heats and Sweats, Cholerick Loosenesses, and Thirsts: Rough Astringents do the same thing, but more weakly, having the Acid obtunded by the Earthy Parts; but by that they are more proper for Loosenesses and Fevers. Acids do also excite the Appetite, by stimulating, and hinder the over-quick Fermentation of the Chyle, and separation of its Spirituous parts, in Windy Exhalations: And for that reason we mix Vinegar with Hot Meats and Herbs, and eat cool Fruits after Meat. Vinegar is the best Antidote against any Poyson, from Acrid Herbs.   Image 42 (page 18) CHAP. V. Concerning Astringents. ASTRINGENTS are, Either Watry-Astringents, in which Water  is most plentiful; which are convenient in hot Diseases, with Fluxes of Blood, or Stools; as Plantane, Knot-Grass. I distill'd the Roots of Flaggs in an open Fire, and had a great deal of Acid, and very little Fetid Oyl, and much Caput mortuum: This was like the distill'd Liquor of Woods. Bitter-Astringents; where the Astringency  is mitigated by the Bitterness, which depends on a crude Turpentine: These, by their Bitterness, make the Astringent Faculty more agreeable to the Stomach and Blood: By their Bitterness they help and preserve the mixture of the Blood; and by their Astringency, which is an Acid in potentia, precipitate some Feverish parts, which are separated from the mixture of the Blood; so Jesuits Powder works; and Tormentil-Roots have been us'd for the same purpose; and so may the Barks of That Image 43 (page 19) taste. 'Tis manifest, that upon giving the Jesuits Powder, a sharpness of �rine is sometimes observable; and when it succeeds, the Water, which at first look'd like Strong Beer, high colour'd, and reddish, turns after a while muddy; the separable Feverish Sediment is precipitated, and the top of the �rine is thin and clear, by the separation of Parts: So that, after the use of the Jesuits Powder, whose Vertues are evident to the Taste, being bitter Astringent, the prevailing Bitterness preserves the mixture of the Blood, and the Astringency separates some easily-separable Parts; which not continuing in their right equal Mixture with the rest of the Blood, cause the Fever, as being Heterogeneous, and raise a Fermentative Commotion for their Segregation. And it is usual with Practisers, to guess and assert the Alterations in the Blood, to correspond to those observable in the Water. It may be, our Country cannot afford such an exact Mixture of Bitter and Astringent, as in the Jesuits Bark; but I believe it does. It may be, we cannot mix Bitter and Astringent Tastes, in the same Proportion, as Nature has done in the Cortex: However, it's evident, that these Qualities of Bitter-Astringent are in the Cortex; and we Image 44 (page 20) cannot imagine any other so probable to work those Effects which it does; for Tormentil-Root and Cinquefoyl have been tryed and approv'd in putting off Agues. Sweetish Astringents, or the Fern-Tastes,  which have a slight Bitterness also. These Ferns are good Vulneraries, stop Fluxes, and abate the Fermentation of the Blood in Hypochondriack Scurveys, by their Crudity and Astringency: So Chalybeats, as Vitriol of Mars, taste sweet Astringent; the Sweetness is most perceptible in the Polypody-Root. In the Female Fern the Mucilage is great; the Astringency is evident in the Male, and in Lonchitis; but in the Leaves of Osmunda, the Mucilage; in the Root, the Astringency, Bitterness, and Orris Smell. Maiden-Hair is Sweet-Astringent, which seems to me the true Character of a Fern-Taste; though some Varieties are observable, as I have noted. The Aromatick-Astringent must be consider'd  amongst the Aromaticks.   Image 45 (page 21) CHAP. VI. Concerning Bitterness in Plants. THe Fourth Principle our Senses discover in Plants, is Oyl, which produces Bitterness, and Aromatick Tastes, plain Turpentine, and Fetid Smells, with a Taste contrary to an Aromatick. The most crude state of Oyl Vegetable, is in Mucilages and Sweetness; the next is in Bitters, which have their Taste from a Turpentine mixed with much Earth, and fixed by an Acid; as the following Instances will convince. Hypericon Leaves, the Roots of Valerian, Herb Robert, and especially the Leaves of Chamaepitys, or Groundpine, taste Bitter, and smell of Turpentine: The Taste of Turpentine it self, is Bitter; and so is the Taste of most Gums, which are the product of Turpentine Trees, and Plants; as Myrrh, Ammoniacum, &c. If we consider how many Plants are Aromatick, arising from Turpentine, how many are Resinous, and the constant Image 46 (page 22) Greenness of many Trees and Plants, which depends on Turpentine (which did not Freeze in the hard Winters); It will seem more probable that Bitterness depends on Turpentine, which is Compounded of Oyl, Acid and Gumminess. Bitters yield a great deal of Oyl by Distillation, as Wormwood, Centaury, Bitter Almonds; Olives have also a Bitterness. The Milk of Bitter Plants, as Sonchus, Jacea, and Celandine, is exceeding Bitter; and it must needs be allowed, that the Milk is Oyl, diluted by much Water. Bitters have generally some Fetid Smell, or Aromatick Odour: which shews us, that Bitter Plants abound in Oyl, from whence Odors chiefly arise. The Flowers of Orange and Elders, are Bitter; and so are the Fragrant Flowers of other Trees, as Sloe-Trees, Jessamy, Roses, Hawthorne, Lilies of the Valley. The Turpentine in Bitters, is fixed by an Acid, which readily coagulates the Oleous Parts, if it be a strong Acid; but a mild Acid only detains Oleous Particles in their mixture with Water; as it appears by Milk; for in the making of Butter, the Oyl is visibly separated in the form of Butter; and the Acid, which kept it fluid, is apparently in the Butter-milk. This Acid Image 47 (page 23) by dividing the viscous Oleous parts of the Butter, rendred it fluid in the Milk; and from thence its Whiteness depends. In Distillation of Fats and Oyls, an Acid appears; as also in the Distillation of Gums, which may artificially be produced, by the mixing of Oyl and Acid. On this Acid in Bitters, joyn'd with much Earth, an Astringent Faculty depends, which is eminent in many Bitters. That much of Earth concurs to the production of Bitters, and fixing of Turpentine, appears, in that all Bitters produce much Salt, which we call Fixed (this being nothing probably, but the Union of Acid and Earth by calcination) but the Oyl in which the Bitterness resides, is easily driven away by the Fire, and remains not in the Salt or Earth; whence it is also proved to be an Oyl, fixed by its crude Associates, Acid and Earth. I distilled half a pound of Gentian Roots, in an Earthen Retort, in an open Fire; from it was 'stilled an Acid Liquor, with the Water, and a Bitter Oyl, without any Volatile Salt; which confirms my Hypothesis, of Bitterness being an Oyl fixed by Acid: and the Caput Mortuum exceeded all the Liquor in the Receiver.   Image 48 (page 24) CHAP. VII. The Table of the Varieties of Bitter Tastes, Compounded, and their Vertue. They are either,  �. I. Cool Bitters. BItterish Astringent in the Dock kind,  Hydro-Lapathum, Sorrel, Tormentil, &c. These cool Inflammations inwardly and outwardly; they check the Paroxysms of Agues, by their Astringency, (which is a latent Acid, Associated with Earth): By their Bitterness adjoyned, they cleanse the Stomach, excite Appetite: By their Astriction, and their Bitterness, they preserve the Blood from Putrefaction: In short, they imitate the effects of Bezoartick mixtures, consisting of Bitter and Acid. Watry-Bitter; when the Bitter is much  diluted by Water, as in Fumitory, Succory, &c. which cool the Blood, and dilute it Image 49 (page 25) by their Waterishness; and by their Bitterness amend the Acidities, and cleanse the Choler, by taking off the coagulating Acid, which coagulates its Lymphatick Vehicle; therefore these Tastes are Cholagogues, and Diuretick, cooling also in Fevers. Bitter-Acid, which works stronger than  the Bitter-Astringent; they are Diuretick, and Antifebrifick, by their Acid Bitterness. Bitter-Sweet, as in the Pea-Taste; by the  Sweetness they lenifie the sharpness of Humors; by the Bitterness they cleanse the Stomach, Kidneys, and Lungs.   �. II. Or Hot Bitters. A middle state of Vegetable Oyl, is observable  in Turpentine Plants, as in Hypericon; and their Smell and Taste will evince them to be pure Turpentine; their Taste is Bitterish and Astringent, and their Smell Terebinthinate: in these the Acid fixes much on the Earthy Parts, and produces an Astringency; whereby the Oyl is more loosned from it. It's well known, that all Vide Sulph� Turpentine and Gums have a latent Acid, whence they are more easily distilled by additions of Absorbents; and their true Image 50 (page 26) Vertues best Extracted by Tinctura Satis Tartari. The Vertues of Turpentine Plants depending on the Oyl, are Pectoral, Cleansing, and Diuretick; and by their Astringent Faculty stopping; but by both Vulnerary: for what better Vulnerary can there be, than that which is Cleansing, and Astringent, and smells Balsamick, as Turpentine Plants? These Plants do bear the name of Balsamick, which are Terebinthinate and Aromatick; as Botrys, Mecha-Balsam, Juniper, Ladanum segetum; and these are more agreeable to the Stomach, than ordinary Turpentine; and besides, their Vulnerary Faculty may be Cordial, they being also Aromatick. To these I must add another Class of Balsamicks, which having Turpentine in their Smell, give a Smell like dead Nettle; so in red Lamium there is a Turpentine flavor, but another Smell is perceived also. In Panax coloni, and Sideritis, there is the same Dead-Nettle Smell; and in Galeopsis both Smells are perceivable. A third degree of Balsamicks is in the Geranium Moschatum, and Geranium Columbinum, which taste Astringent, & smell of Musk; and since other Geraniums smell of Turpentine, but these of Musk, I do suppose that the highest state of the Oyl Vegetable, is a Image 51 (page 27) rarefied Turpentine, which thereby becomes Odoriferous: Hence Terebinthinates taken inwardly, after a farther separation from their Acid, by the Salts of the Blood, cause a Violet Smell in the �rine, because Aromaticks produce the same effects in the �rine; therefore Aromatick Odors, and Turpentine, are of an agreeable nature. Many Turpentine Balsams are of an Aromatick Smell, as Balsam de Tolu, Balsam Mechae, Balsam Peruvian, Benjamin, Storax; and many Herbs, as Ladanum segetum, and Botrys, which have a Fragrant Terebinthinate Smell; and so has Juniper, Cedar, and Sassafras; besides Oyl of Turpentine will easily extract these Fragrant Oyls from Vegetables, and is frequently mixt with them by Sophistications; whence I may argue, that they differ only as Turpentine is mixt with a latent Acid; and as the other are more pure from Acid; and therefore more Aethereal or Odoriferous: The Roots of Valerian smell like Turpentine, and the Flowers like Jessamy a little dryed. Strong Bitters, with a Fetid Odor, as  Ballote; these by their Bitterness correct Acids in the Stomach and Blood, and by their Fetidness amend the Acid in the Nervous Juyce, and cause an equal expansive Image 52 (page 28) motion of the Spirits, and prevent their unequal distribution into some Nerves, as in Fits of Convulsion. Strong Bitters, with a Pungency, or Acrid  Bitters, as in Celandine; these correct Acids, and open Obstructions also, by giving a quick motion to the Blood, which is done by their Volatile Bitter Oyl, and Volatile Pungent Salt, on which their Taste and Vertue depend. Strong Bitters Aromatick, as in Wormwood  and Eupatorium Cannabinum, they work by their Volatile Oyl and Salt on the Blood, and Stomach; whence they are accounted Antidotes against Coagulations, Venoms, and Pestilential Infections. Strong Bitters only, or pure Bitters, without  any Aromatick or Fetid Odor, or Pungency; such is the Bitterness in Bitter Almonds, and Centaury, their parts are more fixed than any of the other Strong Bitters: These cleanse the Stomach from Acid Phlegm; open the Liver, by correcting the coagulating Acids in the Blood; they mix with Acids, and pass by �rine; they preserve the Blood from coagulation, and help the office of the crude Bile in Hydropical Image 53 (page 29) Cachexies; they have an Astriction by their Acid and Earthy Parts, which abounding in Bitters, help the Oyl in correcting Acids. The Principles of Bitters united by the Fire, produce fixt Salts, which correct Acids better than Bitters; which also act as fixt Salts in all their effects. Elder-Bitters and Smells, as in Scorphularia;  these have a discussing Faculty outwardly, by their Fetidness and Bitterness. Nauseous Tastes, which are,  1. Nauseous-Bitter, which depends on a composition of Mucilage and Bitter, as in Bryony-Roots, Squills, Berries of Spina Cervina, and Fox-Gloves; the Mucilage in the Stomach relaxes the Fibres, and causes the Bitter to stick longer on them; and so to act more strongly in Vomiting and Purging; the same Taste is in Polygala and Sena. 2. A Nauseous Taste depends on a sweet Bitter, mixed with Mucilage and Pungency, as in Aloes, Agarick, Rubarb: And Docks want only the Sweetness; but have Bitter, Slimy, Sub-acrid Astringency. Image 54 (page 30) 3. Too much Sweetness is Nauseous; so is Manna, Honey, Polypody-Root; a Sliminess or Gumminess is in Honey and Manna. 4. Too much Bitter is Nauseous: Thus, in sweet Gall, the over-much Sweet or Bitter, over-impregnates the Papillae in the Mouth and Stomach, and cause an aversion in the Stomach; as too much Light offends the Eyes, and makes them Water. 5. An ill Smell gives a Nauseousness; as in Aron Pouches, whose Smell will make any one vomit: And such have been the Smells of many Herbs which I bottled with warm Water, as Henbane and Spurge. In Tastes depending on a Volatile Oyl of Vegetables, (with which is mixed a Pungent Volatile Salt) this Oyly Salt produces either an Aromatick or Fetid Smell, and a pleasant Aromatick or Offensive Taste. The Taste is Aromatick, when the Sense is briskly affected, and a pleasing Agitation of Spirits produced. Aromaticks affect both the Smell and Taste gratefully; they have a motion of Particles and Texture, agreeable to the Motion and Texture of Spirits: Spirits of Vegetables differ nothing from their Oyly Salts� but by their being largely diffused Image 55 (page 31) in a Vehicle; and an Oyly Salt is a Spirit contracted, and without a Vehicle. The effects of Aromaticks on the Body,  are to warm the Stomach, and discuss Wind; and these constitute the Class of the Sweet Aromaticks, or Fennil-Tastes: These are accounted Carminatives, because they rarefie the flatuous exhalations from the Chyle, in the primae viae, and so discuss them. These by their Sweetness allay the sharpness of Rheums, and lenifie their Acrimony: They are full of an Oyly Salt, by which they open the Passages of the Lungs and Kidneys: They extraordinarily discuss Tumors outwardly, by opening the Pores, and attenuating the matter included: The same Taste is spread through all the parts of the Plant, by the Oyly Salt: These Plants are umbelliferous. An Oyl may be distilled from these Plants, which has the Taste, Smell, and Vertue of these Plants: Whence I conclude, the Taste and Smell to proceed from the Oyl and Volatile Salt associated. The Second Class of Aromaticks, is the  Bitterish Aromaticks, as Rosemary, Marjoram, Basil, Calamint, and Penny-Royal: By their Bitterness adjoyned to their Volatile Image 56 (page 32) Oyl and Salt, they correct Acids in the Stomach, cleanse the Lungs, and open Obstructions in the Glands, caused by coagulate Serum. The same effect is produced by the Saline Pungent Oyl, in altering the Acids in the Glands of the Brain, in correcting and attenuating its Lympha, and Succus Nervosus; which, as all other Glandulous Humors, are prone to Stagnation, and Acidity: These Aromaticks by exciting their Motion, correcting Acidities, and thereby rendring the Succus Nervosus more Volatile, deserve the name of Cephalicks; and it's not improbable, that the Volatile parts dispose the Medicine to circulate towards the Brain, as Windy Liquors disturb the Head, and no other part. These Medicines evacuate Serum from the Blood, promote its circulation, and attenuate all the Humors of Chyle, Serum, Lympha, and Succus Nervosus; these agree in Virtue with the Fennil Class, except that these work more by their Bitterness, as well as by the Pungent Oyl. The same Taste in these is spread through the whole Plant; only the Bitterness depends on a fixt Oyl or Terebinth; but the Aromatick on the Oyly Salt. Aromatick-Acrids, as Pepper, Ginger; these  Image 57 (page 33) have a very Acrid Volatile Salt and Oyl. All Aromaticks are Cordial, by rarefying the Blood by their Volatile Parts; but the Acrid-Aromatick is the highest, having most Volatile Salt in it; whereas the former have more Oyl than Salt. These Acrid-Aromaticks have either a Sweetness, or Bitterness; and may be referred to the former Classes. Aromatick-Astringents: As Aromaticks,  they are Cordial; and from their Astringency, they strengthen the Fibres of the Stomach and Membranes, and all Nervous Parts; and by an Acid evident in their Astringency, they hinder the greater Rarefaction of the Blood by their fragrant pungent Oyl.    Image 58 (page 34) CHAP. VIII. Of Tastes joyned to Fetid Smells, making them contrary to Aromatick. WHEN the Oyl and Salt of Plants are in very great Proportion in any Plant, so as to emit violent Steams, offending the Organ of Smelling, but chiefly (forcibly) repelling the Spirits towards the Brain, (which creates an Aversion to it) a Fetid Smell is perceived. That a Fetor proceeds from Oyls, appears by the Smell of Rancid Oyl, and all distill'd Oyly Substances; as Fat, Butter, and Oyl-Olive distill'd. That a Fetor, in the highest Degree, has also a Volatile Salt admixt, is proved by the Excrements of Animals, putrefied Flesh, �rine, Blood, and putrefied Vegetables; which yield a Volatile Salt. It does appear by divers Herbs bottled with Water for two Months, that a Fetor is produced; from the Mucilaginous, as Mallow-Leaves; from the Bitter, as Artichoak-Leaves; Image 59 (page 35) from the Narcotick, an exceeding Fetidness, as Henbane-Leaves; from the Excoriators, as Spurge: These smelling like the Excrements of Animals. Horse-radish smelt like Garlick; Sorrel like Horse-dung. Putrefaction concurrs to produce these Fetors, by Separation of a Volatile Oyl and Salt, from the Acids and Earthy Parts of the Plants: So Spirit of Soot has an Oyly Salt; and the Fetid Oyly Salt is easily separated from �rine and Blood, after Putrefaction. Many Acrid Plants are Fetid; so Sophia Chirurgorum, and the Pouches of Aron, are abominable. Cotula Faetida, Nettles, Garlick, and Onyons, have an Acrid Taste, and are very Fetid:. So is Galbanum, Assa Faetida, and Sagapenum. Divers Bitters are Fetid, as stinking Horehound; and all Elder-Smells, as Scrophularia, are Bitter-Fetid: So the stinking Gums are Bitter, as well as Acrid and Fetid. The Mucilaginous are also Fetid, as in Atriplex olida. That there is but a Difference in degree betwixt Aromatick, and Fetid Plants, appears by many Instances; as Galeopsis smells Fetid at first handling, afterwards Aromatick. The Flowers of Valerian are very strong, and offensive at first getting; after a little drying, they are Aromatick: So in the Preparations of Musk Image 60 (page 36) and Civet, if in a great quantity, or while fresh, they stink; afterwards, in a small quantity, they are more grateful: So the Leaves of Coriander stink; but the Seed is Aromatick. Elder-Leaves are Fetid, yet the Flowers are very Fragrant; so are the Flowers of Saponaria, though the Leaves resemble Elder. The Blossoms of most Trees are Fragrant, though the Leaves smell Crude. From the afore-mention'd Instances,  Fetids are  1. Bitter. 2. Acrid. 3. Mucilaginous, which are generally Narcoticks.   From the afore-mention'd it may be inferr'd, that Fetids inwardly are of a very hot Nature, discussing Tumors outwardly, and opening the Pores. Inwardly, Fetids, by their Volatile Parts, do pierce the Channels of the Nerves, mend the Crudity of their Nervous Juyce; and by their Faetor, they excite a different Motion from that in Hysterick Fits, and in Convulsions; and do remove the Cause of that tumultuous Motion in the Spirits, by correcting Acidities, and Stagnation in the Succus Nervosus, which is disposed to them, as all other Glandulous Liquors be. Image 61 (page 37)  Narcoticks have all of them an heavy offensive Smell, like Poppies, or Solanum; or have a sweet heady Smell, like Roots of Bears-Ears. Milky-Narcoticks taste Mucilaginous, Bitter,  and Acrid; as Poppies, and Lettice: The Milky Juyce is an Argument of an Oyl, and the Acrid of a Volatile Salt adjoyned. Opium is a Bitter-Acrid, has a Resin, and Gum inflammable: Though it's easily extracted by the Spirit of Wine, yet the Bitterness and Acrid, in which its Vertue is founded, is most corrected by Spirit of Vinegar, Juyce of Lemons, Juyce of Quinces, or any other Acid, as well as by drying it, and evaporating some Part of the Narcotick Fume. The Second Class may be of Bitterish,  Sub-acrid, Mucilaginous Narcoticks; as Solanum Lethale, Bacciferum, Stramonium, Cynoglossum: Besides the Pungency, Solanum Lignosum has a Bitterness: The Roots of Cynogloss boyl'd, smell like Spirit of Harts-Horn. Fresh Tabaco smells Narcotick about the Flowers, and is Bitter, Mucilaginous, and Acrid: It much resembles Henbane by its Figure, Oyl and Clamminess to the Touch; Image 62 (page 38) but by its Bitterness and Pungency, Solanum Lignosum. The Third Class of Opiates, is Sweetish,  Acrid, and Fetid, differing from Poppy smell, as Cicutaria, Napellus. The Roots of Henbane are very sweet. These produce Giddiness, with a stupor; and their best Antidote are Acids, as Vinegar. The Fourth Class has a Bitterish Acrid  Taste, as Cowslips; and these have also a Fragrancy very heady, being of a low degree amongst Opiates: The Roots of Cowslips are very Acrid and Bitterish. By the afore-mentioned Instances it appears, that Opiates have very hot Effluviums, which offend the Smell. By the same, Opiates inwardly produce Sweat in so small a quantity as one or two grains; and are very Fetid by their Oyly Acrid Salt, which runs through all the Classes of Opiates. The Bitterness and Sweetness in some Opiates, no way conduce to encrease their Soporifick quality, but are different in many Opiates. Narcoticks taken inwardly, immediately affect the Nerves in the Stomach, and produce an heaviness there; which I have been Image 63 (page 39) sensible of, in tasting the Solanum, and Poppies; and they cannot pass a Digestion and Separation, nor by a circulation arrive at the Brain, so soon as their effects are produced therein: Therefore Narcotick Fumes must pass through the Pores of the Nerves, and begin to fix the Spirits in the Membranes and Nerves of the Stomach; by which a stupor is communicated to the rest. Something of the Opiates passes a Digestion, and afterwards a Circulation through the Blood; where it makes no alteration by its Narcotick quality; but being Bitter and Acrid, it produces a Diaphoresis, as others of that Taste do. In the Nerves these Narcotick Fumes weaken the brisk expansion of the Spirits, (which causes waking) and their too great Agitation, (which causes pain) and likewise stops their Tumultuous motion in Convulsions, and the violent motion of the Heart and Pulse, as well as any Flux of Humors whatsoever, by abating the violent contractions of the irritated Fibres. Humors that are Acid are corrected by the Acrid Taste and Bitterness; but Choler can no other ways be helped, but by abating the Acid combined with it, and making it corrosive, as well as by stopping the motion, and evacuation of it. From the Symptoms allayed by Narcoticks, I argue, That they Image 64 (page 40) work not as Oyls and Volatile Salts, though they have them; for they rather produce an expansion, agitation, and tumult in the Spirits: And I also conjecture, that the Narcotick Faculty is best deducible from such a combination of the Volatile Oyl and Salt, with a Mucilage, as to gain thereby a particular Figure, Motion, or Texture; by reason of which, it weakens the motion of the Spirits, and in too great a quantity destroys their fluidity. Burnt Alum mixt with Gun-Powder, destroys its Elastick force, and weakens the burst of a Gun. Water loses its fluidity by the small Particles of Cold: And Mercury is made Solid, by the Fumes of Lead. Nothing can be more easily fixt, by divers additions of other things, though in it self it has a greater Agitation of parts than other fluids, which being stopt in their internal motion, become Solids; and if Opiates do weaken or deprive the Nervous Juyce of its Internal Agitation, from thence all their Phaenomena may be explain'd. All Narcoticks have offensive Smells, by which we are taught by Nature to avoid them; and this Antipathy can proceed from nothing, but the disagreeable Texture and Motion of the Narcotick Fumes to our Image 65 (page 41) Spirits: Opiates cause not Sleep, unless in great quantity, in Consumptive Bodies; for in them, a little quantity troubles the Head, and disturbs the Spirits with Giddiness, because their Spirits are very hot and fiery, and their motion, for want of a serose Vehicle, very violent; but it seems not probable, as some conjecture, that one grain of Opium should force so much Serum to flow to the glandules of the Brain, as to fill them, and produce Sleep, by too much diluting the Spirits: Whereas we frequently drink a full Gallon of Water, or other Liquors, which supply a greater quantity of Serum, without causing Sleep. Opiates by their sharp Acrid Salt stimulate, as Venereals; and by their Bitter Sliminess and Acrimony, they purge. A slimy Mucilage attends Opiates, which outwardly has a good effect to temper Heat in Inflammations; whilst the Effluviums that are Narcotick, abate the Agitation of Spirits. By their Mucilage; Opiates may repel, and also inwardly given, by the same they allay sharpness of Coughs, and corrosive Salts; whilst their Narcotick Fumes fix the motion of Humors, by robbing the Spirits of their Activity; by their Bitter-Acrid they discuss; and by their Mucilages mollifie Image 66 (page 42) Tumors; as inwardly, their Bitter-Acrid corrects the Acid; the Mucilage tempers the Choler; and for this end the Poppy-Syrups and Waters, are the best; having more Mucilage than Acrid or Bitter. But Opium more Bitter and Acrid, than Mucilage; wherefore it is more convenient in Acid Humors.   CHAP. IX. Of Volatile Salts, and the Tastes and Vertues depending on them. IN many Plants, there is a Volatile Salt, discernable by the Acrid Pungency, produced on the Tongue; as in Aron-Roots. That this Pungency is a Volatile Salt, though it has no Saltish Taste, appears by the following Experiment. I distilled some Mustard-seed in a Retort, which afforded both Oyl and Spirit; which being rectified, turned Syrup of Violets green; though this Salt, in its natural state, will not so readily turn Syrup of Violets, as Animal Image 67 (page 43) Salts do. The Infusion of Aron-Roots in Water, did a little green the Syrup of Violets, after some time. Spirit of Scurvy-Grass, or Aqua Raphani composita, would not turn Syrup of Violets; nor Horse-Radish-Roots, infused in Water; tho' the leaves bottled with Water, turned the Syrup after some time. Juyce of Aron-Roots would not turn it; the Leek-Roots sliced into Water, mixt with Syrup of Violets, turned it after a long time. The mixture of other Principles with the Salt, hinder its greenning of the Syrup of Violets: So a Decoction of Harts-Horn for the same reason, will not do what the Spirit does in turning the Colour. It's well known that Vinegar, and other Acids, as Lemmon, Citron, Sorrel, do best correct the Pungent Acrimony of the Vegetable Salts; and therefore Vinegar is used in Sallets; Oyl is used for the securing of the Stomach from their corrosive Acrimony: Yet the Acrid Salt of Vegetables will not ferment with Acids, as the Animal Salts do. Juyce of Aron-Roots, and Spirit of Scurvy-Grass, will not ferment with Oyl of Vitriol. These different Classes, I have observed in the Volatile Salts of Plants. Image 68 (page 44)  The Watry-Acrid having a pungent Smell,  like Mustard or Scurvy-Grass, and the Cresses: These have a tolerable Pungency, and but a little Oyl with their pungent Salt. The Vertue of these Cress-tasted Plants, is first from their Salts, which excite Appetite, and volatilize the Acid Ferment in the Stomach, and therefore are Stomachicks: In the Blood they amend the coagulating Acids, open Obstructions in the Spleen and Brain, and all the Glandules; and therefore are Antiscorbutick, Splenetick, Diuretick, and Sudorifick; outwardly they discuss, and have the Virtues of Volatile Salts, in Pains, and Scald-Heads, and Scorbutick Spots. By the Watry crude Parts adjoyned, they temper their own Acrimony, and make it more agreeable to hot Bloods; as in Brooklime. I distilled Colewort-Roots, which tasted like Horse-Radish; and had an Acid mixt with Pungency, which would not turn Syrup of Violets; this distillation was in Sand, in a glass Retort. There are many degrees of Pungency in this Class; so that choice may be made for particular Constitutions. There is a Bitterness in many of this Class, which helps the Operation of the Acrid: if the Acrid prevails, they belong Image 69 (page 45) to this Class; if the Bitter, they are referrible to the Bitters with Acrimony. The second Class of Volatile Salts, is in rank Tastes, and smells like Garlick� and  Onyons, whose Smells are rank Fetid, and their Tastes very pungent Hot. From Horse-Radish Leaves, bottled up with Water two Months; and from their smelling like Garlick, as well as from their pungent Taste, and quick flying up the Nose and Eyes, like Sal-Ammoniack, I conclude, that the Cepaceous kind, would very properly constitute a second degree of Volatile Salts, and a much stronger than the former. They correct Acids, and Phlegm in the Stomach; and excite Appetite by their Pungency: they attenuate the Phlegm in the Lungs, and open Obstructions there, by their Volatile Salt; and therefore are good Pectorals and Stomachicks: They alter the Blood, as Volatile Salts; and are good against Infection, and the Scurvy; and as Diureticks, by their Salts they are good for the Dropsie: outwardly they discuss more than the former Class; and their Mucilaginous Roots are emollient, and ripen Apostumes; and by their Salt they draw forcibly, and discuss and attenuate. Thlaspi tastes like Horse-Radish, and smells like Garlick. Image 70 (page 46)  The third, and highest degree of Vegetable  Acrid-Salt, is in the Exulcerators, Vesicatories, or Corrosive Tastes: These have an Acrimony that destroys the Organ of Tasting; as among Animals a fierce Volatile Salt is in Cantharides, which is Vesicatory: And strong Spirit of Sal-Ammoniack blisters the Tongue. So in the first Class of Exulcerators, there is a very Acrid Taste, and quick pungent Scent, depending on the Salt only; the Plant being Watry, having no strong Oyly Smell: and these may be called Watry Exulcerators; as the Ranunculus, Anemone, Aron, Dragons, Ranunculus flammeus: Vesicatories pierce the Pores, and by their pungent Acrimony irritate the Glandules in the Cutis, to send forth their Serum, and separate the Cuticula into a Blister. The Corrosives have a higher degree of Acrimony; they pierce the Cuticula and Cutis, with Pain; they alter and tear their Pores, drive out their Serum, and thereby induce an �lcer, and corrosion of the Cutis. Note, That the first Class is Vesicatory,  or Corrosive Watry. The second Class is where the Volatile  Image 71 (page 47) Salt is mixt with a hot fiery Oyl; as in Euphorbium, Ivy-Gum; and these Plants have a strong Smell, with an Acrid Taste. The Milky or Resinous Exulcerators, have an Oyl more fixt, joyned to an Acid-Acrid Salt; as Tithymalus, and Esula; and these smell Acid, rather than of any hot Scent. Mezereon, and Laureola, have a faint Lily-Smell; in these the Oyl is not much conducing to any Corrosiveness: But that depends on the Volatile Salt alone, made more Volatile by addition of some Oyl. The third Class of Corrosives, is in the  Acrid-Acid; as Rosa Solis, which is accounted Vesicatory, but very mild, the Acid being contrary to Volatility. Acids mixt with Minerals, as in Crystals of Silver, and Aqua Regia, become Corrosive; and divers other Minerals, which are not in themselves very sharp, by their mixture, become Corrosive; as appears by Sublimate. Lime has a mixed Salt. This sort of Corrosiveness happens in the fixt Salt of some Plants; as in the Salt of Ash-Tree. Acids become Corrosive in the Fire, by their separation from Earthy Parts; as in Salt-Peter Spirit; Oyl of Vitriol, Aqua Image 72 (page 48) Fortis, and Spirit of Vinegar; but this way I know no Plants Corrosive: The Acid of Plants cannot be so attenuated by Digestion in the Plant, as that of Minerals is in the Fire. Fixt Salts in Soap-Ashes, by being united in a solid form, act all together, and so corrode. So a Vesicatory is made out of Ashes of Ash-Tree; but this way cannot happen in Plants, because there is naturally no fixt Salt in them, but what is made by Fire. Oyls of themselves cannot be Corrosive; they pierce by their tenuity, but cannot corrode; their Pungency is from the Salt only, though their Heat and Smell is from the Oyl; but generally the Corrosives have no Smell, or inconsiderable; where it would not happen, if the Oyl were Corrosive: whence I conclude, that such a Taste depends on the Volatile Salt diluted with Water, or sharpned by the addition of Oyl, though crude, as in Tithymalus; but especially by a Volatile Oyl, as in Euphorbium.   Image 73 (page 49) CHAP. X. Of Sweet Tastes. THIS Taste depends on an equal Mixture of the Principles of Plants: The Acerb, Austere, Woody Fruits become Sweet, Fragrant, and Spirituous, when ripen'd by the Heat of the Sun, like a Chymical Digestion, that separates the Principles, and produces a looser Mixture; and the Sweet Fruits, by Distillation, afford a Spirit; so that, an Acid from the Crudity, and Spirituous Oyl and Salt from the Ripeness, are evident in Sweet Tastes. A Mucilage appears in Liquorish, and an Oyly Smell in the Flowers of the Pea-Taste. Sugar has both Oyl and Acid: So that from different Sweet Tastes, you will find all the Principles of Plants to be latent in a Sweet Taste; which will appear from the Classes of Sweet Tastes:  1. Sweet-Watry-Crude, in Grass and Corn. 2. Sweet-Aromaticks, in Carrotts and Parsneps. Image 74 (page 50)  3. Sweet-Acrid, in Rapunculus. 4. Sweet-Mucilaginous, in Figgs; or Oleose, as in Nuts. 5. Sweet-Subacid, in Strawberries and Grapes. 6. Bitter-Sweet, in Aloes. 7. The Pea-Taste, in Fitches, &c.   Pea-Tastes are either  1. Sweet and Rough, 2. Sweet and Bitterish, or 3. Sweet, and compounded with a Bitter-Acrid, and sometimes a Mucilage.   The Watry-Crude are Cooling, in distill'd Waters and Decoctions. The Sweet-Aromaticks are Nourishing, and very grateful to the Stomach. Sweet-Acrid are also Esculent and Diuretick; by their Acrimony and Sweetness they are Pectoral, lenifying sharp Rheums, and opening the Breast. Sweet-Mucilaginous are both Pectorals and Diureticks, defending the Membranes both by their Sweetness and Mucilage, and making them more slippy for Phlegm and Gravel, as well as allaying the Sharpness of Saline Humors by the Mucilage. Sweet-Subacid are cooling Cordials. Bitter-Sweets are Nauseous Purgers. Image 75 (page 51)  Pea-Tastes are of a crude Juyce, hindring the Fermentation of the Blood, dulling its Salts; especially if a Mucilage be adjoyned. If Astringency, they bind also. If Bitter, or Acrid, or Both, they are opening, and outwardly discussing; as in Melilot.   CHAP. XI. Concerning the Smells of Vegetables, their Differences, and the Vertues depending upon them. THE Smells of Plants are either Cool, Temperate, or Hot.  �. I. Of Cool Smells in Plants. Earthy, which smell of Earth; with  which is joyn'd a Mucilage, as in Mushromes: Or else they are dry Plants, as Mosses. And this Smell of Earth must needs argue a Crude Plant. Image 76 (page 52)  Sorrel-Smells, or Acid, or Sowre: These shew the Acid to abound in a Plant, and the Vertues depending thereon; as in Sorrel, &c. A Crude or Grassy-Smell, resulting from III. an indigested Mixture of Acid, and Earth, and Water; as in Plantane. A Crude Smell indicates a cooling Quality, fit for inflamed Blood, and over-fermented Humors: And outwardly these Plants are repelling, and of a cooling Quality. In the Plants which have the Smells above-mentioned, there is not so great a Digestion of their Juyce, as to attenuate it, and rarefie it, so far as to emit brisk Particles to affect the Senses, like Oyl or Volatile Salts of Plants.   �. II. Of Temperate Smells. Temperate Smells of Plants are mixt of Hot and Cold, being Mellowy-Sweet; such as is in Ripe Fruits, as in Apples, &c. This Smell arises from an higher Digestion of the Crude Juyce in Fruits, by the Heat of the Sun; which produces that equal Mixture of Principles, which is most agreeable to the Body of Animals, for their Food; and by this Smell, and the Aromatick, Image 77 (page 53) they choose it naturally. Most Fruits may, by a farther Fermentation, be prepar'd to yield an inflammable Spirit; and therefore, Fruits fermented in the Stomach, yield a brisk Spirit to the Blood. And by their Acid, (which appears to the Taste and Smell after Fermentation) they cool the Blood and Choler, and excite Appetite. A grateful Acid may be smelt in the Stomachs of Birds, which feed on Hips; from which I have made a very grateful Spirit, by Fermentation. In Surfeits of Fruits, the Fermentation of them is carried on to a Putrefaction; which happens frequently, when Fruit is eaten by any Person when he is very hot; or else the Fruit lies in the Stomach crude, and unfermented, very Acid, and Griping, as it happens to cold Stomachs.   �. III. Of Hot Smells. Hot Smells are either Agreeable, or Offensive. Agreeable Hot Smells are  1. Terebinthinates; in which the Oyl of Plants is more rarefy'd, than in any other of the former Smells; but yet it is mixt Image 78 (page 54) with, and fixt by an Acid: And this Smell indicates a Vulnerary Quality, by resembling the Smell of Turpentine. A Balsamick Smell depends on a State of the Oyl of Plants, betwixt a Turpentine and Aromatick Smell; as in Botrys, Ladanum segetum, &c. 2. Aromaticks; in which the Oyl is less fixt than in the former, there being less Acid mixt with it, (which appears in the Aromatick Astringent:) In Aromaticks, there is a Bitterness, or Sweetness, with an Acrimony. All Aromaticks are Cordial. 3. Fragrant Smells; in which the Sense of Smelling is highly pleas'd, by the Odor depending on the highest rarefy'd Oyl of Plants; and therefore very little affects the Taste, the Oyl not being fixt in the Juyce of the Plant so much as in the former, by an Acid, as in Jassemin-Flowers, Orange-Flowers, &c. These Plants afford the best Cordial-Water; and are only an higher Degree of Aromaticks. Hot Offensive Smells are  1. A Quick Pungent Smell; which is in Horse-Radish, or Mustard-Seed, or Ranunculus: These Plants have a Volatile Salt, Image 79 (page 55) and the Vertues depending on it. The proper Smell of Vegetable Salts, is a quick Pungency. Animal Salts have also a Smoaky or Urinous Smell, by which they differ. 2. Fetid Smells; which arise from a Salt and Oyl very Volatile; and therefore have outwardly a most discussive Quality, and inwardly an Anti-Hysterick Quality.  1. Fetid, like Elder; and those Plants have the same Vertue; as Scrophularia. 2. Rank, like Garlick, as Onions and Leeks; and these have the same Vertue as Garlick. 3. A Rancid Oyly Smell, which many of the Pea-Taste have; as Goss-Flowers, &c. and these are fit for Oyls, and Oyntments. 4. Narcotick Smells, like Poppy; and all these Plants have an Opiate Faculty. 5. Nauseous Smells, such as is in Aron-Pouches; which Smell is most Abominable.  In Bryony-Berries the Nauseous Smell intimates a Vomitory Faculty. Those Smells which do resemble other Plants, have the same Vertue; but not always, when they resemble other Things.  Image 80 (page 56) Rocket,  have a Mustard-Seed Smell.  Scurvy-Grass, Horse-Radish, Water-Cresses, &c.   St. John's-Wort,  have a Turpentine-Smell.  Herb-Robert, Firr, Pine, Juniper, &c.   Germander,  smell like Hopps.  Wood-Sage,   Scordium,  like Garlick.    Leaves of Primroses,  smell like Marmalet of Quinces.    Pansies,  smell like Orange-Flowers.  Milkwort,   Siliquose-Willow-herb,  like Codlings.    Ballote,  have all of them a dead Nettle-Smell.  Ironwort, Galeopsis, Chickweed, with Ivy-Leaves, Ground-Ivy-Leaves, Clowns-All-heal, Cardiaca, &c.   Image 81 (page 57) Hare-Bells,  smell all like Lily-Flowers.  Daffadills, Dog-stones, Marsh-Marygolds, Violets, &c.   Solanum Bacciferum,  have all a Poppy, or heavy, strong, Fetid, Opiate Smell.

From the 'fore-mention'd Instances, it appears, First, How much the Vertues of Plants may be known, and how easily distinguish't by their Smell: Which will appear more clearly, in my New Method of Plants. Secondly, I may inferr, That the Smell of Hot Plants depends on their Oyl, though the Volatile Salt gives it a quick Pungency. Image 83 (page 59)  Thirdly, That the Acid and Earthy Parts, are smelt as well as the Volatile. Fourthly, That Fetids, and Aromaticks, differ only in Degree,; the Fetids being strongest; both of them being produced by an Oyly Volatile Salt, which separates the Oyl from the fixing Acid. In the Sense of Feeling, (by which the Impressions on the Tongue are explain'd) Pleasure arises, � blando & molli affrictu, by which the Spirits are drawn into the Part. In Pain there is impulsus fibras convellens & corrugans, by which the Spirits are distracted and dissipated: So in Aromaticks, the Papillae are gratefully and gently rubbed; in Fetid Tastes, more violently, and the Sense of Smelling is also offended by a violent Impression, but pleas'd with a gentler.    Image 84 (page 60) CHAP. XII. Of Occult Qualities. THat there are many Textures in Plants, which we shall never be able to describe; and some Internal Agitations of Particles, which we can never explain, is undeniably true; though we observe the Tastes and Smells produced by each particular Texture; and the Qualities of Hot and Cold, depending on the motion of Particles. So in Narcoticks we taste Mucilage and Acrimony, and smell a Foetor; which sensible Qualities we find in Narcoticks; though we know not their particular Texture and Motion, by which these particular Compositions of Tastes act, nor the manner by which they stupefie. Purgers have their particular Composition of Tastes, resulting from a particular Texture, on which their Irritation depends; their Textures being not describable other ways, than by their several Tastes depending on them, and the Nature of the Principles, which produce their several Tastes; and are the Ingredients constituting that Particular Image 85 (page 61) sort of Texture. Seeing therefore, that the particular Compound Tastes of each Plant, are the Effects of particular Textures; where we find the same Combinations of Tastes, the same Textures must needs be inferr'd. Therefore, we know also the Textures of Plants, by their several Tastes and Principles, though not directly, and immediately by our Senses. The Figures of minute Particles, are too small to be visible; and the manner of their Internal Motion doth not affect our Feeling, or other Senses; and therefore the Textures of all Plants, and all other Bodies, will ever be Occult Qualities as well as the Effluviums of all Bodies, not affecting our Senses. The same Occult Qualities are in the most known and evident things; as Fire, whose Heat we feel, but cannot describe the Figure and Motion of its Particles; neither can we describe the Texture of Mucilages, Bitters or Turpentines, &c. yet we can distinguish the Tastes and Smells, and Principles, which constitute each particular Texture: Therefore, I conclude, that the Texture and insensible Effluviums, are alike obscure in all Bodies, as well as Vegetables; and nothing is more Occult in one Vegetable, than in another; but because we Image 86 (page 62) know not the Nature of Animals, on which Plants produce their Effects; we cannot so clearly give an Account of the Operation of some Tastes and Smells, as of others. So in Opium, we cannot explain the manner of its Stupefaction, because we know not the Nature of Animal Spirits, on which it acts; yet we perceive the Gumminess, the Acrimony, the Bitterness, and Fetidness, by which it acts; and by which its manner of stupefying will be explain'd, when the Nature and Motion of Animal Spirits is sufficiently understood. Not only the Nature of Spirits, but also the Nature of some Humors in the Body, are yet unknown; and the Use of some Parts too; as the Spleen, and divers Glandules, which may make the manner of the Operation of many Medicines less evident to us: For since the discovery of the Muscular Fabrick, and use of the Heart, by Dr. Lower; and the Circulation of the Blood, by Harvey; and the Insertion of Nerves into the Muscles of the Heart, by Dr. Willis: a more rational and evident Account may be given of the Operation of Cordials, by their particular Tastes and Smells; as in Aromaticks, which abound with a Volatile Oyl and Salt; whereby they quicken the Circulation of the Blood, and excite a brisker Image 87 (page 63) Motion in the Animal Spirits, by which the Muscles of the Heart are moved. It is not only the unknown Nature of Humors, and the undiscover'd Use of some Parts of the Body, which makes the manner of the Operations of some Medicines obscure; but also the want of examining the Nature of the Medicine it self, and the particular Compositions of Tastes which are in it. I hope, I may give a further light to the Ingenious Enquirers into the manner of the Operations of Vegetables, by observing these two things: That Plants have Compounded Tastes,  by which they act; as Rubarb purgeth by a Bitter, Slimy, Sub-acrid Astringent Taste. St. John's wort is a Vulnerary, by being Bitterish, Astringent, and having a Turpentine Smell. Liver-wort is Hepatick and Diuretick, by being Bitterish, Sub-acrid, Mucilaginous, and having a Turpentine Smell, (as in the Second part of the Book, you will find all the Plants after this manner described.) And therefore I infer, That though each particular Taste hath a Vertue, as considered by it self; yet divers Tastes being Compounded in one Plant, every Plant hath a particular Effect depending on the Image 88 (page 64) Action of all the Qualities together; from all which the Vertue of a Plant is deduced, and not from one only Taste: But we shall better apprehend the Effects of Vegetables produced on Animals, if we consider That every Animal contains divers  Humors, separated by particular Parts into distinct Vessels; and that these Humors have different Tastes, Natures, Digestions, and particular Motions given them by the Mechanical Structure of an Animal Body; and that the Organical Parts have such an agreeable contrivance, as by the acting on One Part, the Whole may be disturbed and variously moved; which appears in Smells that are offensive to Hysterick Persons.   Image 89 (page 65) CHAP. XIII. Of Specificks. THat Notion of Specificks, I think most rational, differs much from what is usually describ'd by Authors, by whom Medicines are call'd Specificks; because they act principally upon the account of some Property or peculiar Virtue, which is unknown, and not by any manifest Qualities of Bitter, Acrid, Acid, &c. But I will not dispute those Author's Notions, but propose my own to the Ingenuous and Candid, to be examin'd by them. I therefore define a Specifick Medicine to have a particular Taste, or Composition of Tastes or Smells, whereby it acts on some Humors of an Animal, more peculiarly and effectually than other Medicines. There are three sorts of Specificks; First, Specifick Purgers. Secondly, Specifick Alterers, which are of a contrary Taste to the Humors corrected. Thirdly, Specifick Alterers, which are of the same Nature, Image 90 (page 66) and of the same Taste, as the Humors they correct. First, Specifick Purgers: Purgers are called Specifick, because they evacuate a particular Humor; and if they be considered as Alterers, they have the same Taste as the Humors they Purge; by which Taste they dispose that Humor to a separation from the Blood: And Purgers are also most peculiarly suited to the nature of the Humor they Purge, by the different degree of Acrimony, which irritates. So Cholagogues, as Dock-Roots, and Rubarb, are Bitter and Slimy, like Choler; and also Sub-acrid, which is the lowest Degree of Irritation. Phlegmagogues are also Cholagogues; as Aloes, and Agarick, which have a Bitter-sweet, like Choler; and have a Mucilage or Gumminess, like Phlegm; and also a greater Degree of Acrimony than the former Cholagogues; which seems necessary for Phlegmatick Humors, the Choler being more fluid. Hydrogogues are also Phlegmagogues; for Phlegm is but an inspissate Glandulous Lympha; and the Resinous Purgers have the Gumminess of Phlegm, and a greater Degree of Acrimony to mix with the Serum of the Blood, and also to stimulate the Glandules of the Guts and Stomach: This strong Acrimony Image 91 (page 67) in Resins, resembles the Saltness in the Blood, it being also a Salt. Melanagogues differ not from Phlegmagogues, and the mild Hydrogogues; as Sena, which is Bitterish, Slimy, Sub-acrid. Note, That black Hellebore is very Acrid, by which it is of a contrary Taste to Melancholick Humors; and corrects Acids, as well as purges Phlegm and Choler. Secondly, Specificks, which are of a contrary Taste to the quality of the Humors, to be corrected. So Acid-Medicines are contrary to Bitter Choler, and Acrid Salts, and destroy their Tastes. Earthy-Salt and Bitter Medicines, are contrary to Acidity and Acerbity in the Lympha, Serum, and Chyle: as also Sulphurs and Oyls are. Watry Mucilages, and Crude Juyces, are contrary to the inspissate Serum of the Blood, by diluting it. Astringents are contrary to the Laxity of the Fibres, and Oyly Medicines are contrary to their roughness and dryness. These Contrarieties of Qualities, and also the Specifick Purgers, are mentioned in the Specifick Class, to which I refer the Reader. Thirdly, Specifick Alterers (which are appropriated, and call'd Friendly to some part) by being of the same Taste and Nature, Image 92 (page 68) as the Humors that are prepared and separated by that particular Part; the Nature of which will more plainly appear by the following Comparison, betwixt the Tastes of Animal Humors, and the Tastes of those Medicines which respect particular Parts. The Natural Taste of Choler, is Sweet, Bitter, Slimy; in Birds Acrid: from this Taste of Choler, it is natural for us to argue, That a Medicine of the same Taste, will act like Choler in the Body, and supply the defect of it when wanting, and restore it to its natural Taste and state, when weakened, dull'd, or coagulated by Acids; or wants a perfect Digestion and Separation from the Blood: Therefore, by reason of a Bitter, Slimy, Sub-acrid Taste, in Choler; Gentian-Root, which hath that Taste, is accounted an Hepatick; and also Carduus, with all others of the same Taste; upon the account of a Bitter Sub-acrid in Choler, Celandine and Turmerick-Roots are Hepaticks also. Upon the account of Bitterness only, all Bitters are Hepatick, as Succory. Upon the account of Sub-acrid only in Choler, all Acrids may be accounted Hepaticks, on the account that Choler hath a sweet Oyliness in the Taste, and that Sweets become easily Bitter. Therefore all sweet Image 93 (page 69) Spices and Aromaticks, are Hepatick: Choler is also Fetid; and therefore the Fetid Gums, which are Bitter, Acrid, and Fetid, are good Hepaticks: And all Plants abounding with an Oyly Pungency, and their distill'd Oyls, are Hepatick, because the same Principles are in Choler. Sweat and �rine have the same Salt Taste; and therefore the same Salt Medicines are both Diuretick and Diaphoretick. This Salt in the Serum of the Blood, is of the nature of Sal-Ammoniack; therefore mixt Salts are the best Diureticks and Diaphoreticks. All Medicines of a Salt Taste, as fixt Salts, pure Volatile Salts, or Vegetable Oyly Salts, in Aromaticks, Fetids, and Acrids, and many Salso-Acids, promote both Sweat and �rine; and all Volatile Salts smell �rinous. Note, That Testaceous Medicines become Diuretick, by getting a Salt Taste in the Stomach, by reason of the mixing of its Acid with them. The Saltness of the Blood preserves its Mixture, and prevents Putrefaction; and so do all the Salts above-mentioned; and therefore they are Antifebrifick, and Alexipharmliick. The Lympha of the Conglobate Glandules, is also Salt, like the Serum of the Blood; Image 94 (page 70) and therefore in Arthritick pains, requires the same Salt Medicines, which move Sweat and �rine, with a cool Watry Vehicle: for the use of this Lympha is not only to mix the Chyle and Blood, but to dilute both; the defect of which Lympha is best supply'd from the Watry Sub-acrid Plants. The Lympha of the Conglomerate Glandules, is Watry, Slimy, Sub-acid; this constitutes the Ferment of the Stomach, and is separated into the primae viae, not only by the Salival Glandules, but by these also of the Stomach, Pancreas, and Guts. This Lympha is supply'd by spirituous Acids, and Slimy, Watry Sub-acids, as Lemmons, Oranges, and dulcified Spirit of Salt; these excite Appetite, and help the Fermentation of Meats. So Leaven, which ferments Dough, is Sub-acid and Salt. Salt Tastes are also pleasing to the Stomach, because they are Sub-acids. The Lympha, which moistens the Cavity of the Lungs and Wind-pipe, is Slimy, Sweet, and Milky; in Hecticks this is deficient, and is therefore supplyed with Milks, and Watry Sweet Mucilages. The use of the Spleen is yet unknown, but it certainly separates a Glandulous Humor, whose Taste is probably Sub-acid; and therefore many Astringents, which are Image 95 (page 71) produced from Acids, as Vitriolum Martis, and the Fern-Astringents, help the preparation, and supply the defect of the Splenetick Liquor: All Medicines altering the Depravation of it, must be contrary to Acids. The Menses have a particular Smell, not unlike Flowers of Marigolds, or Saffron, which are Fetids; and so is Atriplex Olida, and therefore esteemed an �terine; and for their agreement in Smell, all other Fetids, though they have not the same sort of Faetor, are accounted �terines; as Volatile Oyls, Salts, and Fetid Gums. Aromatick Smells are grateful and pleasing to the Spirits, and therefore are used as Cordials and Cephalicks; we cannot Taste the Spirits, though we could meet with the Succus Nervosus, because they are the Instruments of Taste; but there seems nothing fitter than Smells to explain their Natures, which work much on the Spirits, they being subtle and invisible Effluviums, like them. Narcoticks have a Fetid Smell, by which they stupefie the Spirits, by stopping their Motion and Elasticity, and the Fluidity of their Glandulous Vehicle. Amongst Plants, those are esteemed fittest for Food, which have a sweet Taste; Image 96 (page 72) and such hath been accounted the Taste of Chyle: Sweet things breeding the greatest quantity of it, and most nourishing; for Chyle, like sweet Tastes, contains an Oyl and Acidity, well digested and diluted with Water. Therefore, all Medicines of a sweet Taste are agreeable in Taste, Temper, and Digestion to Animal Bodies; and all those Plants, which are of a lower Digestion than Sweets, are, in respect of the Humors of an Animal, crude and cooling; as Earthy, Watry, Acid, and Mucilaginous Tastes; which are therefore used in the too high Fermentation of the Blood. Those Plants which have a higher Digestion than Sweet, are also of a higher Digestion than the Natural Temper of Animal Humors, and are therefore Heating, Opening, Cordial, as Bitter, Acrid, Aromatick Tastes; and Causticks, which have the highest excess above sweet Tastes, and consequently above Animal Humors, are therefore Corrosive and Poysonous to them. Plants do not only consist of some certain Principles, but they receive also a different Digestion and Fermentation in each Plant; which is very manifest in the Fruits of Plants; which at the first taste Acerb, and afterwards become Sweet and Sub-acid: and in those Seeds, which whilst unripe Image 97 (page 73) taste Austere, but afterwards become Sweet Oyly. This particular Digestion in Plants, may be observed by their several Tastes, and predominant Principles, which produce them.   CHAP. XIV. Of the different Ways of knowing the Vertues of Plants; but most particularly, of the Natural Method of deducing them from the several Modes of Taste, and from Experiments. ALL the Knowledge we have of Nature, is grounded on our Senses; they first inform us of certain Qualities produc'd by their Objects; into whose Natures we afterwards enquire, by trying Experiments about those sensible Qualities; and also, by examining the Principles which produce them. Image 98 (page 74)  I have mention'd the Principles on which Tastes depend; and those Vertues which all Authors allow them upon the Account of that Dependence. This Knowledge of the Vertues of Plants, by their Taste, is much improved by divers Experiments made about particular Tastes; which I will mention; and also, those Vertues which are known by the Modes of Tastes. But I will first take notice of some other more general Hints of the Vertues of Plants, we have from other Senses. Nature seems to have been very much sollicitous for our Knowledge of the Vertues of Plants, by exposing them to so many of our Senses. By the Touch we feel Mucilages, and the Gumminess of Turpentine Plants, and the Waterishness of all Juyces, and the Acrimony of the Vesicatory. By the Eye we observe the Signatures of Plants; in which Nature has given us an Hint of enquiring farther into their Natures, for Remedies in particular Distempers; and therefore, the Character of some Diseases is fixt on the Plant: Pulmonaria has the Marks of corrupted Lungs, Scrophularia, Chelidonium minus, and Fabaria, have knobbed Roots like the Piles. Spots are observ'd in Aron, Image 99 (page 75) and Dragon-Leaves, like those in Scorbutick Persons. Other Plants resemble the External Cause of a Distemper; as the Stalks of Dragons do the Skin of a Serpent; the Roots of Doronicum, and the Tops of Echium, resemble a Scorpion; against whose Venom they are us'd. Where Distempers have no outward Figure, there the Plant bears the Figure of the Part affected. So Nutmegs, Walnuts, Poppy-heads, and Peony, have some Resemblance of the Head of Animals, and are useful in different Distempers of it. The Eye also observes the Likeness of the Yellow Colour in Saffron, Turmerick, Celandine-Roots, and the Gall of an Animal. The Likeness of slimy Mucilages to many Glandulous Humors, is obvious; and the Colour and Smell of �rine in Lixiviums, is manifest. I have already described the Similitude betwixt the Tastes of Medicines, and Animal Humors; by which the Friendly Specificks may be known. I have also given an Account of the different Smells of Plants, and the Vertues intimated by them. Image 100 (page 76)  I will now consider the different Modes of Tastes; from whence we learn what sort of Affections Plants will produce in our Bodies; and also those which are produc'd externally: For as the Tongue is affected by the Taste, so are the Parts and Humors of an Animal, by the same Plant, when us'd for a Medicine. But, besides these Vertues known by the Modes of Taste, other Vertues are proved by Experiments; which we could never have inferr'd to have belong'd to a particular Taste, by any Modes of it: And therefore, though we know the particular Tastes of Plants, and the Composition of them; yet we cannot know what Vertues may belong to them by that Taste, until we throughly have try'd and examin'd the Nature and Effects of each particular Taste; and also, what Tastes may produce in Composition, more than Simple Tastes. Acids taste Cool, Sowre, and Pungent, or Sharp, and a little Rough: From the Coolness on the Tongue we inferr, that Acids will cool the Blood, Choler, hot Salts, and the Stomach, and Thirst; and that outwardly they will repell and cool Inflammations. Image 101 (page 77)  From their Pungency we believe them Aperitive, Penetrating, and also cutting Phlegm. From their Roughness we conclude they may stop Loosnesses and Haemorrhages, as Astringents do, but more weakly. The Experiments which have further illustrated the Efficacy of Acids, are these. The Coagulation of Milk, Choler, and the Serum of the Blood, shews their cooling Vertue more efficaciously. Acids are contrary to Volatile Salts, and combine with them into a Mixt Salt; by which Acids are Diuretick. Acids joyn'd with Minerals, produce Vitriolate Tastes; and the same Taste observable in Scorbutick Spittings of Blood from the Gums: The Blood tastes like Vitriolum Martis, as I have often found ""t. A particular Acid"

TO keep the Reader from being at all surpriz'd at the Date of the Title-Page, I must inform him, that a good part of the ensuing Tracts were Printed off, and in my custody, the last year; and the rest had come out with them divers moneths ago, if the Noble Author had not been hinder'd from committing them to the Press by the desire and hope of being able in a short time to send them abroad more numerous, and by his being hinder'd to do so partly by Remove, partly by the want of some Papers that were odly lost or spoil'd, and partly by the sickness of himself, and divers of his near Image 4 (unnumbered page) Relations. And some of these Impediments do yet suppress what the Author intended should have made a part of the Book, which now he suffers to be publish'd without them, though divers of his Papers about some other particular Qualities have been written so long ago, as to have lain for many years neglected among other of his old Writings: Which that he may have both leasure and health to review, and fit for publication, is the ardent wish of the sincere Lovers of Real Knowledge, who have reason to look on it as no mean proof of his constant kindness to Experimental Philosophy, that in these Tracts he perseveres in his course of freely and candidly communicating his Experiments and Observations to the publick, notwithstanding the liberty that hath been too boldly taken to mention them as their own by some later Writers; as particularly by the Compiler of the Treatise, entitul'd Polygraphice, who in two Chapters hath allow'd himself to present his Reader with above Fifty Experiments, taken out of Unnumbered page our Authors Book of Colours, without owning any one of them to Him, or so much as naming him or his Book in either of those Chapters� nor, that I remember, in any of the others. Nor did I think this practice justified by the confession made in the Preface, importing, that the Compiler had taken the particulars he deliver'd from the Writings of others. For, this general and perfunctory acknowledgment neither doth right to particular Authors, nor, by naming them, enables the Reader to know, whether the things deliver'd come from persons fit to be credited or not: And therefore, since 'tis but too likely, that such Concealment of the Names, if not �surpation of the Labours of the Benefactors to Philosophy, will prove much more forbidding to many others to impart their Experiments, than as yet they have to our generous Author; it seems to be the Interest of the Commonwealth of Learning openly to discountenance so discouraging a practice, and to shew, that they do not think it fit that Possessors of useful pieces of Image 5 (unnumbered page) knowledge should be strongly tempted to envy them to the Publick, to the end onely that a few Compilers should not be put upon so reasonable and easie a work, as by a few words or names to shew themselves just, if not grateful. But not to keep the Reader any longer from the perusal of these Tracts themselves, I shall conclude with intimating onely, that what our Author saith in one of them concerning the Insufficiency of the Chymical Hypothesis for explaining the Effects of Nature, is not at all intended by him to derogate from the sober Professors of Chymistry, or to discourage them from useful Chymical Operations; forasmuch as I had the satisfaction, some years since, to see in the Authors hands a Discourse of his about the Usefulness of Chymistry for the Advancement of Natural Philosophy; with which also 'tis hoped he will e're long gratifie the Publick.   Page 1 ADVERTISEMENTS Relating to the following TREATISE. TO obviate some misapprehensions that may arise concerning the ensuing Notes about Particular Qualities, it may not be improper to adde something in this place to what has been said in anotherSee Tracts about Cosmical Qualities, &c. to which is prefixt an Introduction to the History of Particular Qualities; Printed at Oxford 1671. Paper in reference to those Notes, and consequently to premise to the particular Experiments some few general Advertisements about them. And I. we may consider, that there may be three differing ways of treating Historically of Particular Qualities. For either one may in a full and methodical History prosecute the Phaenomena; or one may make a Collection of various Experiments and Observations whence may be gathered divers Phaenomena to illustrate several, but not all of the Heads or Parts of such an ample or methodical History; or (in the third place) one may in a more Image 6 (page 6) confin'd way content ones self to deliver such Experiments and Observations of the Production, or the Destruction or Change of this or that Quality, as, being duly reason'd on, may suffice to shew wherein the nature of that Quality doth consist, especially in opposition to those erroneous conceits that have been entertained about it. Of the First of these three ways of treating of a Quality I pretend not to have given any compleat example; but you will find, that I have begun such Histories in my Specimens about Fluidity and Firmness, and in the Experiments, Observations, &c. that I have put together about Cold. The Second sort of Historical Writings I have given an Instance of in my Experiments about Colours; but in these ensuing Notes, the occasion I had to make them having obliged me chiefly to have an eye to the disproval of the errours of the Peripateticks and the Chymists about them, I hope I shall not be thought to have fallen very short in my Attempt, if I have (here and there) perform'd what may be required in the Third way of writing Historically of a Quality; my present Design being chiefly to give an Intelligent and Historical Account of the Possible Mechanical Origination, not of the various Page 7 Phaenomena of the particular Qualities succinctly mentioned in these Notes; though, my secondary end being to become a Benefactor to the History of Qualities by providing Materials for my self or better Architects, I have not scrupled to adde to those, that tend more directly to discover the Nature or Essence of the Quality treated of, and to derive it from Mechanical Principles, some others (which happen'd to come in my way) that acquaint us but with some of the less luciferous Phaenomena. II. That you may not mistake what is driven at in many of the Experiments and Reasonings deliver'd or propos'd in the ensuing Notes about Particular Qualities, I must desire you to take notice with me, what it is that I pretend to offer you some proofs of. For, if I took upon me to demonstrate, that the Qualities of bodies cannot proceed from (what the Schools call) Substantial Forms, or from any other Causes but Mechanical, it might be reasonably enough expected, that my Argument should directly exclude them all. But since, in my Explications of Qualities, I pretend only, that they may be explicated by Mechanical Principles, without enquiring, whether they are explicable by any other; that which I need to prove, is, Image 7 (page 8) not that Mechanical Principles are the necessary and onely things whereby Qualities may be explain'd, but that probably they will be found sufficient for their explication. And since these are confessedly more manifest and more intelligible than substantial Forms and other Scholastic Entities (if I may so call them) 'tis obvious, what the consequence will be of our not being oblig'd to have recourse to things, whose existence is very disputable, and their nature very obscure. There are several ways that may be employed, some on one occasion, and some on another, either more directly to reduce Qualities (as well as divers other things in nature) to Mechanical Principles; or, by shewing the insufficiency of the Peripatetic and Chymical Theories of Qualities, to recommend the Corpuscularian Doctrine of them. For further Illustration of this Point, I shall adde on this occasion, that there are three distinct sorts of Experiments (besides other proofs) that may be reasonably employ'd, (though they be not equally efficacious) when we treat of the Origine of Qualities. For some Instances may be brought to shew, that the propos'd Quality may be Mechanically introduc'd into a portion of matter, where it Page 9 was not before. Other Instances there may be to shew, that by the same means the Quality may be notably varied as to degrees, or other not essential Attributes. And by some Instances also it may appear, that the Quality is Mechanically expell'd from, or abolish'd in, a portion of matter that was endow'd with it before. Sometimes also by the same Operation the former quality is destroyed, and a new one is produc'd. And each of these kinds of Instances may be usefully employ'd in our Notes about Particular Qualities. For, as to the first of them, there will be scarce any difficulty. And as to the second, since the permanent Degrees as well as other Attributes of Qualities are said to flow from (and do indeed depend upon) the same Principles that the Quality it self does; if, especially in bodies inanimate, a change barely Mechanical does notably and permanently alter the degree or other considerable attribute; it will afford, though not a clear proof, yet a probable presumption, that the Principles whereon the Quality it self depends are Mechanical. And lastly, if, by a bare Mechanical change of the internal Disposition and structure of a body, a permanent Quality, confess'd to flow from its substantial Form or inward Principle, be abolish'd, Image 8 (page 10) and perhaps also immediately succeeded by a new Quality Mechanically producible; if, I say, this come to pass in a body Inanimate, especially if it be also, as to sense similar, such a Phaenomenon will not a little favour that Hypothesis which teaches, that these Qualities depend upon certain contextures and other Mechanical Affections of the small parts of the bodies, that are indowed with them, and consequently may be abolish'd when that necessary Modification is destroyed. This is thus briefly premis'd to shew the pertinency of alledging differing kinds of Experiments and Phaenomena in favour of the Corpuscular Hypothesis about Qualities. What has been thus laid down, may, I hope, facilitate and shorten most of the remaining work of this Preamble, which is to shew, though but very briefly, that there may be several ways, not impertinently employable to recommend the Corpuscularian Doctrine of Qualities. For first, it may sometimes be shewn, that a Substantial Form cannot be pretended to be the necessary Principle of this or that Quality; as will (for instance) hereafter be made manifest in the Asperity and Smoothness of bodies, and in the Magnetical Vertue residing in a piece of Iron that has been impregnated by a Loadstone. Page 11 'Tis true, that the force of such Instances is indirect, and that they do not expresly prove the Hypothesis in whose favour they are alledged; but yet they may do it good service by disproving the Grounds and Conclusions of the Adversaries, and so (by removing Prejudices,) making way for the better entertainment of the truth. Secondly, we may sometimes obtain the same or the like Quality by Artificial and sometimes even temporary Compositions, which, being but factitious bodies, are by Learned Adversaries confess'd not to have Substantial Forms, and can indeed reasonably be presum'd to have but resulting Temperaments: As will be hereafter exemplifi'd in the production of Green by compounding Blew and Yellow, and in the Electrical Faculty of Glass; and in the temporary whiteness produc'd by beating clear Oyl and fair Water into an Ointment, and by beating water into a froth, and, more permanently, in making Coral white by flawing it with heat; and in divers other Particulars, that will more properly be elsewhere mention'd. Thirdly then, in some cases the Quality propos'd may be either introduced; or vary'd, or distroy'd in an inanimate body, when no change appears to be made in the body, Image 9 (page 12) except what is Mechanical, and what might be produc'd in it, supposing such a parcel of matter were artificially fram'd and constituted as the body is, though without any Substantial Form, or other such like internal Principle. So when a piece of Glass, or of clarify'd Rosin, is, by being beaten to powder, deprived of its Transparency, and made white, there appears no change to be made in the pulveriz'd body, but a comminution of it into a multitude of Corpuscles, that by their number and the various scituations of their surfaces are fitted copiously to reflect the sincere Light several ways, or give some peculiar Modification to its Rayes; and hinder that free passage of the beams of Light, that is requisite to Transparency. Fourthly, as in the cases belonging to the foregoing number there appears not to intervene in the Patient or Subject of the change, any thing but a Mechanical alteration of the Mechanical Structure or Constitution; so in some other cases it appears not, that the Agent, whether natural or factitious, operates on the Patient otherwise than Mechanically, employing onely such a way of acting as may proceed from the Mechanisme of the matter, which it self consists of, and that of the Page 13 body it acts upon. As when Goldsmiths burnish a Plate or Vessel of Silver, that having been lately boil'd lookt white before, though they deprive it of the greatest part of its colour, and give it a new power of reflecting the beams of Light and visible Objects, in the manner proper to specular bodies; yet all this is done by the intervention of a burnishing Tool, which often is but a piece of Steel or Iron conveniently shap'd; and all that this Burnisher does, is but to depress the little prominencies of the Silver, and reduce them, and the little cavites of it, to one physically level or plain Superficies. And so when a Hammer striking often on a Nail, makes the head of it grow hot, the Hammer is but a purely Mechanical Agent, and works by local motion. And when by striking a lump of Glass, it breaks it into a multitude of small parts that compose a white powder, it acts as Mechanically in the production of that Whiteness as it does in driving in a Nail to the head. And so likewise, when the powder'd Glass or Colophony lately mention'd is, by the fire, from a white and opacous body, reduc'd into a colourless (or a reddish) and transparent one, it appears not, that the fire, though a natural Agent, need work otherwise than Image 10 (page 14) Mechanically, by colliquating the incoherent grains of powder into one mass; wherein, the ranks of pores not being broken and interrupted as before, the incident beams of Light are allow'd every way a free passage through them. Fifthly, the like Phaenomena to those of a Quality to be explicated, or at least as difficult in the same kind, may be produc'd in bodies and cases, wherein 'tis plain we need not recurre to Substantial Forms. Thus a varying Colour, like that which is admired in a Pigeons Neck, may be produc'd in changeable Taffety, by a particular way of ranging and connecting Silk of several Colours into one piece of Stuff. Thus we have known Opals casually imitated and almost excell'd by Glass, which luckily degenerated in the Furnace. And somewhat the like changeable and very delightful Colour I remember to have introduced into common Glass with Silver or with Gold and Mercury. So likewise meerly by blowing fine Crystal-Glass at the flame of a Lamp to a very extraordinary thinness, we have made it to exhibit, and that vividly, all the Colours (as they speak) of the Rainbow; and this power of pleasing by diversifying the Light, the Glass, if well preserved, may keep for a long time. Thus Page 15 also by barely beating Gold into such thin leaves as Artificers and Apothecaries are wont to employ, it will be brought to exhibite a green Colour, when you hold it against the Light, whether of the day, or of a good Candle; and this kind of Greenness as 'tis permanent in the foliated Gold, so I have found by trial, that if the Sun-beams, somewhat united by a Burning-glass, be trajected through the expanded Leaf, and cast upon a piece of white paper, they will appear there as if they had been tinged in their passage. Nay, and sometimes a flight and almost momentany Mechanical change will seem to over-rule Nature, and introduce into a body the quite opposite Quality to that she had given it: As when a piece of black Horn is, onely by being thinly scraped with the edge of a knife or a piece of glass, reduced to permanently white Shavings. And to these Instances o"" Colours"

THE following Treatise, being an Introduction to the Art of Physick, I have, in the first Part, collected from the best Institutions, the Fundamentals of Physick, and have spoken briefly of Elements, Temperaments, Qualities, Sexes, Ages, and the various Temperaments of them, and of native Heat, and of Humours, viz. Blood, Flegm, Choler, Melancholy, Chyle: Also of natural excrementitious Humours, as Milk, Seed, menstruous Blood, yellow Choler, Serum, the Humour of the Stomach, Spittle, pancreatic Juice, Lympha, and Slime of the Guts; also of Parts in general, of a Faculty in general, of Action in general, of the internal and external Senses, of animal Motion, of the Pulse, Circulation of the Blood, Respiration, Image 3 (unnumbered page)Chylification, Sanguification, the peristaltick Motion of the Guts, Generation, Nutrition, of things non-natural in general, as of Air, and the like. But I have treated more largely of Meat and Drink, because they are of great Importance with respect to the Preservation of Health. I have also treated briefly of Sleep and Watching, of Motion and Rest, and of the Non-naturals, and of things contrary to Nature, of Signs, a Crisis, and of Urine. And to conclude this Part, I have treated of Glisters, Vomits, Purges, Bleeding, Leeches, Baths, Frictions, Ligatures, actual and potential Cauteries, Cupping-Glasses, and Issues; of Physical Weights and Measures, and the way of composing the various Forms of Medicines. The second Part, which I call, Materia Medica contracted, was chiefly collected from Etmuller and Marggravius. Lastly, I have added, Marggrav's Shop-Compositions, and a Collection of such Chymical Medicines as I judg most useful. J. PECHEY. From the Angel and Crown in Basing-Lane, London, June 24, 1697.

Of Medicine in general. PHysick, both upon the account of its object, and the necessity of it, is a most Noble Art. It wholly consists of Practice; for all the parts of it are directed to Healing: And therefore it is an Art, and not a Science; the end whereof is Contemplation: And consequently, Treatises that are made up of Hypotheses, or Suppositions, belong rather to Phylosophy than Physick. Image 10 (page 2) But it must be acknowledged, that there are some Diseases incurable, therefore out of the reach of Physick; yet it is necessary to treat of them, that they may be known as such, and foretold, that the Art may not be disgraced. It's said to be Conjectural only, by reason of him that exerciseth it, who can only guess at Diseases and their Causes, the Quantity and Virtue of Medicines, and the particular Proprieties of the Body; for it has as much certainty in it as many other Arts; and to speak the Truth, what Certainty is there, besides the first Truths, and Matters of Faith. It is commonly divided into five parts, viz. Physiology, that Treats of Natural Things: Hygiene, that Treats of Things non-natural, or Things necessary for the preservation of Health; but yet sometimes hurting it: Pathology, that Treats of Things contrary to Nature: Semeiotice, that shews the Signs of Things contrary to Nature: Therapeutice, that Treats of the general way of Cure, by Chyrurgery, Pharmacy, and Diet. But Physiology does not properly belong to Physick, and therefore ought not to be accounted a part of it; yet because it is usually proposed in Treatises of this kind, I will briefly do so. Things that are called Natural are seven, viz. Elements, Temperaments, Humours, Spirits, Parts, Faculties, Actions; and among these, are to be reckoned some other things which are treated of in Physiology, as Age, Sex, and the like. Elements are the most Simple Bodies, of which all other Bodies are first composed, and at last dissolved. The union or conjunction of the Elements in the Body is called mixture; and a Body made up of the Elements, is called mixed. The Elements are Four, viz. Earth, Water, Air and Fire. The Chymists add Salt, Sulphur, and Page 3Mercury, tho' improperly; for in some Bodies, for instance, Gold, burnt Talc, Glass, you cannot find either of the three; and in other mixt Bodies you may find more, as in the Humane Blood, Flegm, Salt, Oyl, Spirit and Earth; and if we should allow that Salt, Sulphur and Mercury may be drawn from some Bodies by the force of the Fire, it does not therefore follow, that they were in them before as first Principles; for perhaps they were produced in them by the Fire: Moreover, they are not perfectly Simple Bodies. Temperament in general, is a convenient proportion of the Elements among themselves, or is a symetrical proportion of the Qualities. A Quality is a certain disposition of insensible Particles, constituting sensible Parts; it is divided into First and Second. These Four are called the first, Heat, Cold, Moisture, Dryness; and that which exceeds the rest, denominates the Temperament. The first Quality among Physicians is termed Actual and Potential; Actual, which is perceived immediately by touching, as Heat in Fire, Coldness in Water, and the like. It's said Potential, when it is not immediately perceived by touching, as Heat in Pepper, Coldness in Lettice. The second Qualities are Colours, Sounds, Smells, Tasts, Gravity, Levity, Hardness, Softness, Smoothness, Roughness, Rarity, Density, and the like. An equal Temperament with respect to weight, consists in an exact mixture of all the first Qualities. An equal Temperament with respect to Justice, as they term it, is improperly called equal; for it's such a proportion of the first Qualities as the Nature of the Mixture requires, whether they are in an equal degree or not. Temperament is divided into Partial and Total. A Partial Temperament is that which is allotted to Image 11 (page 4)every part; as the temperament of the Brain, Heart, or the like. A Temperament that is called Total is ascribed to the whole Mixture, and is made up of such as are partial, as the Temperament of this or that Man. Temperament is also divided into innate and acquired. The innate Temperament is that which naturally belongs to a Man; the acquired is that which comes in the course of years, by reason of things non-natural, or contrary to Nature. All the Parts of the Body, according to themselves are hot and moist; yet with respect one to another, some are said to be hot, cold, moist and dry. The Heart, Blood, Spirits, Arteries, Veins, Lungs, Spleen, Liver, are counted hot; but the Heart is reckoned the hottest. Parts that are counted Cold, are the Bones, Cartilages, Tendons, Membranes, Ligaments, Spinal Marrow, and the like. The moist parts, are the Blood and other Humours, the Brain, and Spinal Marrow. The dry parts are the Bones, the Cartilages, Tendons, Ligaments, Heart, Lungs, Nails, Hair. The signs of a hot and dry Temperament of the whole, are a quick and hard Pulse, a dry habit of the Body, a brown Complexion, crisped Hair, of a brown or black Colour; for Heat feeds on the moisture of the Body, melts the Fat, and drys up the Humours. The Appetite and Digestion are small, there is a proneness to Anger, the Sleep is short and disturbed by reason of the heat of the Spirits; Venery is excessive, by reason of the Acrimony of the Seed; the Wit is Sharp, and the Body Active, because the Spirits are pure. The Italians and Spaniards are so Constituted. The signs of an hot and moist Temperament, are a large Pulse, but not frequent nor hard; a Fat habit Page 5of the Body, but not very Fat; because that proceeds from Frigidity and Moisture. The Complexion is florid and clear; the Hairs are sometimes curled, and sometimes not, and not very Black; the Appetite and Digestion are pretty good; the Sleep moderate and quiet, the Mind chearful; and Venery moderate. The signs of a Cold and Moist Temperament are, a small and soft Pulse, a white and smooth Skin, a soft and fat habit of Body, the Hair Yellow, and most commonly strait, the Appetite great, and the Digestion good; the Sleep very much, a drowsie Disposition, Wit small, an unfitness for Motion, Venery small. And this is the Temperament of most of the Northern People. The signs of a Cold and Dry Temperament are, a small Pulse, and somewhat hard; the Skin somewhat rough, the habit of the Body dry, the Hair thin, Appetite and Digestion small, Sleep shorter than in the Cold and Moist Temperament, little or no inclination to Venery. But it is to be noted, that you must not expect all these signs precisely in these four Temperaments, yet there ought to be most of them; and according to the number of them, you must judge of the excess in this or that Quality.   CHAP. II. Of the Sexes, Ages, and the various Temperaments of them. ACcording to the diversity of Sex and Age, the Temperament is also divers. Sexes differ according to the different Conformation and Temper of the Genital Parts. Image 12 (page 6) Sex is twofold, Masculine and Feminine. The former is most commonly hotter than the latter; which appears caeteris paribus, by the Pulse, that are larger and more frequent, by the habit of the Body, which is dryer, by the greater firmness of the Parts, by the Actions that are stronger and more perfect, by a greater disposition to a Fever, and a less quantity of Crudities; all which, as they proceed from a greater heat, so they vindicate it. Nor does Womens growing sooner, contradict what has bin said, because this is rather to be ascribed to the softness and ductility of the Parts, than to Heat: Nor would it make any thing against us, if we should grant they have more Blood than Men; for if it should be so, it would not follow that they generate more Blood; but that they do not consume so much. They being more salacious, and more prone to Anger, proves nothing; for one may come from their Pride, and the other from the weakness of their Minds; tho' we confess that some Viragoes may be hotter than Men. Age is the various seasons of Humane Life, wherein some notable change is observed. They are eight: Infancy, which continues to the third year. Childhood, from the third to the tenth. Puberty, from the tenth to the eighteenth year. Adolescency, from the eightteenth to the twenty fifth. Juvenility, from the twenty fifth to the thirty fifth. Virility, from the thirty fifth to the fiftieth. Old Age, from the fiftieth to the sixty fifth: Decrepid Age takes up all the rest of the time of Life. The Causes of Ages is the divers proportion of the Native Heat, at this or that time of Life, by reason of natural things, or things preternatural; so that the Ages in all are not circumscribed within the said terms of years; but they happen in some sooner, in some later; and some grow Old sooner than others. Page 7 Infancy is the most Moist of all, which appears plainly from the flexibility and softness of the Members; all other Ages, the farther they recede from Infancy, the dryer they are. But it is not the hotest of all; for the greatest heat would not suit with moisture; for it would either dissipate it, or extinguish it. Heat therefore increases till Virility, and then it is at its height; for the habit of the Body, by continual action of the Heat, is dryed, and presses the mouths of the Arteries, and makes them narrower; so that on this account the thicker part of the Blood is kept from the Parts which it ought to moisten; the Serosities are not purged off, but are daily kept up more and more in the Vessels, they suppress the Fire of the Heart, and at last extinguish it. The abundance of this unconcocted Humidity is the cause of Hoariness in Old Men; and their Baldness arises from the defect of the matter of Hairs; which is a fat Vapour, or at least, because such a Vapour does not come to the Hairs, by reason of a constriction of the Pores. But in the mean while, we must not infer, that Old Men are moistest; for their Blood does not penetrate and moisten the parts of the Body, tho upon the account of the Excrements that are put off upon certain parts of the Body, as the Nostrils, Eyes, and the like, they may seem most moist. From what has bin said it appears, that the next cause of Death in Old Men, is too great a Serosity of the Blood; but the dryness of the Body is the remoter Cause, and want of Heat the most remote; and therefore Old Men are best preserved by hot and dry things, as with Wine, and the Spirits of it, and the like; which revive the languid Heat, and dry up the Serosities.   Image 13 (page 8) CHAP. III. Of the Native Heat. IT may not be incongruous to add something concerning the Natural Heat to the Temperaments; according to the variation whereof, the Temperament varies much. The Natural Heat is nothing else but a quick and confused Motion of a subtile Matter, or certain Fire that is not Lucid, such as we perceive in Lime when it is sprinkled with Water, in several Chymical Fermentations, in Horse-dung, and in Herbs heapt up together and putrifying; yet is it hot, and differs only from our common Fire in degree. This motion arises hence, viz. because a subtile Matter insinuating it self into the Blood, cannot move freely in it, and therefore is forced to exert its power upon the Particles of the Blood, and to agitate them confusedly; so that it has the same Causes with Fermentation, and therefore we may well think it proceeds from it. Fermentation is an intestine Motion among the heterogeneous Parts of any Body, whereby that in some sort, is rarified and fired. It is effected in this manner, viz. A subtile Matter passing through some humid and fluid Bodies, meets with rigid Particles which are not very flexible, which swim in them, and because they cannot accommodate themselves to the Pores, occasion a Confusion; so that then the subtile Matter insinuates it self in a large quantity to fill the Pores, and so it rarifies the said Bodies; as more Men, for instance, can be contained in a Room, when they are quiet and lie still, than when they move disorderly; this is every where seen in humid Bodies, Page 9as Wine that is quiet all the Winter, will Ferment so much in the Spring, as to break the Vessel if there be no Vent, the subtile Matter being put into a motion by the approach of the Sun. But all Rarefaction of a Liquor is not properly Fermentation, but only that which is from an intestine Principle, or an Heterogeneity of Parts, and a diversity of the Pores, by reason whereof the passage for the subtile Matter is rendered more difficult, and consequently there is no Fermentation in Water, or in another Liquor more homogeneous, rarifying over a Fire; for it boils up only by being forced by a great quantity of subtile Matter from abroad, and not from any internal Cause. The Natural Heat, or subtile Matter, resides in the Ventricles of the Heart, especially in the Left, and rarifies the Blood as it passes by. It is kept up by a subtile Matter, which is continually brought to the Heart, from the Nourishment, Chyle, and Blood. We are hotter in Summer than in Winter; for our Pulse are then quicker and stronger; our Thirst is greater, and we then more desire Cold Things, and Digest them without offence, and are injured by Hot Things, and are prone to Fevers; and we perceive no shaking or shivering after Meals, as in the Winter. We are Colder in the Winter, because a serous Humour abounds then in the Blood, by reason Transpiration is less, and the Fire of the Heart is lessen'd by the Cold Air that is breathed in; but the Digestion is best in Winter, and we grow fatter then, by reason of the moderate Heat; for great Heat dissolves Fat, and dissipates the Ferment of the Stomach; and therefore in Fevers, and in Summer, we grow Lean, and have but small Appetites. Moreover, in Sleep our inner-parts are not hotter than when we are awake, yea they are not so hot, as appears by the Pulse, that are then more languid Image 14 (page 10)and less, and by the paleness; and this is agreeable to Reason; for the Blood does not then pass so frequently through the Heart, and consequently does not heat so much; and our Sweating a Nights does not contradict what has bin said, for that proceeds chiefly from Vapours retain'd by the Coverings, and condensed upon the Body. The Natural Heat is sometimes suddainly raised, as by Anger, or Joy, the Animal Spirits on this account flowing oftner into the Fibres of the Heart, move the Blood oftner, and increase the Fire of the Heart: This Heat is also increased by the motion of the Body, and by the use of Spices and Wind. It is destroy'd chiefly three ways, viz. by suffocation, dissipation, and want of repair; it is suffocated by too much Blood; as a small Fire by too much Wood, or by the Viscosity of the Blood, or the Coagulation of it by Cold or Poison. It is dissipated by too great Labour, or violent Sweats. It cannot be repair'd when there is want of Meat and Drink, or when the Aliment is weak, or by reason of a compression of the Vessels, or the thickness or viscidity of the Blood. In Old Men the Natural Heat dies, partly because it is oppress'd with Serum, and partly because in a long tract of Time it is dissipated.   CHAP. IV. Of an Humour. AN Humour is a liquid Substance in the Body of an Animal, bred according to Nature, by Meat and Drink; it is twofold, Nutritious and Excrementitious. Page 11 Nutritious Humours, are Humours apt to be turned into our Substance. They are innumerable; but the chief of them are these four, viz. Blood strictly taken, Flegmatick Blood, or Flegm; Choleric Blood, or Choler; Melancholy Blood, or Melancholy. Blood strictly taken, is the redder and more temperate Portion of the Mass of Blood; they that have abundance of it are chearful, and comely. Flegm is the whiter and cruder Portion of the Mass of Blood, of a Cold and Moist Temperament. Those that abound with it, are Slow, Sleepy, Pale and Fat. Choler is the thinner Portion of the Mass of Blood, of an hot and dry Temperament: They that have it in abundance, are Angry, Agile, Witty and Lean. Melancholy is the earthy and gross Portion of the Mass of Blood, of a cold and dry Temperament. They that abound with this Humour, are Sad, Fearful, and Black. Chyle is a liquid Mass bred in the Stomach and Guts from Meat and Drink; I say in the Stomach and Bowels, because some Chylification is made in these, tho' chiefly in the Stomach; but we shall speak more particularly of Chylification among Natural Actions. The Chyle is expelled from the Stomach partly by the Muscles that contract the Belly, and partly by the impulse of the Liver; and partly by the Peristaltic motion of the annular Fibres of the Stomach, successively contracted from the upper Orifice to the lower. The Chyle being thrust from the Stomach into the Guts, is further elaborated there, by the ferment of the Stomach which it brings with it, and by the Bile and pancreatic Juice, which entring into the Duodenum, and mixt with the Chyle, are fermented together; and together with the Chyle, pass into the lacteal Veins, which are innumerable small Vessels, Image 15 (page 10) 1 page duplicate	 Page 11 1 page duplicate	 Image 16 (page 12)so very small that they can't be seen, unless they are full of Chyle; they come out of every part of the Intestines and Mesentery. Caspar Asellius found them out in the year 1622. in dissecting a live Dog well fed. Presently after their rise, they aim at the nearest part of the Mesentery, whereunto the intestine from which they arise is knit; then they go the readiest way to such glandules of the Mesentery as are nearest to them; but in their passage sometimes, many little Branches meeting, grow into one great Trunk, viz. before they insinuate themselves into the gland, to which we said they were going; but in their very entrance into the glands, or a little before, this Trunk separates again into new Branches, more, and smaller than the other, which are obliterated in the very substance of the gland: Out of the gland there spring again new capillary Veins, which by and by meeting together, make one Trunk again as before; which being carried towards the beginning of the Mesentery, in their march join to themselves, others of the same kind meeting them, and so grow larger and larger, and at last very many enter into the great or middle gland of the Mesentery, in the same manner they entred the smaller, and some pass over its Superficies, and by and by they all empty themselves into the common receptacle of the Chyle, that lies under the said gland. This receptacle is seated under the Celiac Artery, and emulgents at the Vertebrae of the Loins, whence there springs a Duct, that presently enters the Diaphragm, with the Arteria magna, where it begins to be call'd Ductus Thoracicus. This Duct having pass'd the Midriff, it marches further up under the great Artery, till about the fifth or sixth Vertebra of the Thorax, where it turns a little aside from the great Artery to the Left Hand, and so below the intercostal Arteries and Veins, under the pleura and gland thymus, it ascends to the Page 13left subclavian Vein, into whose lower side it opens, just there where the left jugular Vein enters into it on the upper side, so that their Mouths face one another; but it opens not into this Vein with any large Orifice, but by six or seven little ones, being all covered together in the interior Cavity of the Subclavia, with one broad Valve looking towards the Cava from the Shoulder, whereby here is granted to the Chyle and Lympha a free passage out of the Ductus Chyliferus into the Subclavia; but their return, or of Blood with them out of the Vein into the Duct is prevented. This Duct ending thus in the subclavian Vein, the Chyle that it conveys into it, passes with the Blood, returning by the Cava into the right Ventricle of the Heart. The Chyle in the Stomach and Guts keeps in some sort, the Colour of what is eaten: So Cows and Sheep, because they feed on Grass, have a greenish Chyle. The Chyle of a Man is most commonly of an Ash Colour; but in the lacteal Veins, and the Thoraic Duct, 'tis quite White. An excrementitious Humour, is an Humour that is not fit to be converted into our substance: 'Tis divided into Natural and Preternatural; the Preternatural belongs to Pathology. The Natural excrementitious Humour, is that which has not an inimical quality. Excrementitious Humours are partly generated in the Blood, because our Nourishment has some Particles which are apt to become Excrementitious, but partly because the Blood loses much of its subtile Parts, by being often rarified in the Heart, and by nourishing our Vital Fire; and on this account, many of its Parts are render'd unfit for use, and do hurt, unless they are eliminated from the Mass of Blood, for the Flegm stops the passages: The Earth, or the Caput mortuum, coagulates; the Water hinders the Image 17 (page 14)inflammability of the Blood; and the Sulphur by adustion, becomes bitter and acrid. Moreover, divers excrementitious Humours are evacuated in divers places; and meerly according to their diversity, as to magnitude or figure, in this or that emunctory, and in the particles of this or that Humour, without the help of any fictitious Faculty: And this will not seem strange to any one, who sees that meerly by a diversity of the Pores and Parts, a wholesom and unwholsome Herb grow near together in the same Ground; and one sort of Juice slows in the Tree, another in the Bark, and another in the Leaves and Fruits. A Natural excrementitious Humour, is divided into useful and unuseful; a Natural excrementitious Humour is useful, when of it self it is some way serviceable to the Body, as Milk, Seed, Menstruous Blood, the Mothers Blood, yellow Choler, Melancholy, Serum, the Humour of the Pericardium, the acid Humour of the Stomach, Spittle, Pancreatic Juice, Lympha, and the slime of the Guts. The Natural excrementitious Humour is unuseful, when of it self it is no way serviceable to the Body wherein it is bred; as Urine, Sweat, Tears, Snot, the Blood of a Woman in Labour, the Blood of the Hemorrhoids, and the Wax of the Ears. Milk is a portion of the Chyle, separated by the glands, into the milky Tubes, for the nourishment of the Infant. The milky Tubes are Vessels properly belonging to the Breasts, and they come from their innumerable Glands, and terminate in the Paps with many holes; they are incompassed here and there with Nervous Fibres from the small rope of the Arm-pit, that these being inslated, they may be contracted to press out the Milk. Page 15 The Matter of Milk is Chyle, and not Blood, as many heretofore have thought, and that it was turn'd White in the Breasts; but it does not stay there long enough to be elaborated; and beside, the Parts are not formed for such an use. Moreover, a piece of Succory eaten before, has bin drawn out with it, and also the Bran of Bread eaten before: A Purging Medicine taken by the Nurse, is presently mixt with the Milk, and Purges the Child; and sometimes when it does not the Nurse, Saffron and Burnt Wine, and other things taken by the Nurse, communicate the tast and smell to the Milk in the space of half an hour, or less; and the Nurse presently after drinking a large draught, finds a chillness and fullness in her Breasts; which could not be if Blood were the Matter of Milk: Besides, a Woman would consume away if Blood were the Matter of Milk; considering, that a Woman in Health affords daily a Quart of Milk. Moreover, Fat Women have more Milk than Lean, and yet the Lean Women have most Blood, and their sanguiferous Vessels are larger: But you will say, that Blood is sometimes sucked out of the Breasts, and that in Women that give Suck, the Veins of the Breasts are more Turgid than at other times; and therefore Blood is the Matter of Milk. To the first I answer, That Blood is not sucked without Violence; and therefore this does not prove that it is the Matter of Milk. Secondly, The greater distension of the Veins of the Breast prove nothing also, because this is to be imputed to the greater motion of the Blood upwards, by reason of the compression of the lower Arteries by the Womb. I suppose the Thoracic Duct is the passage of the Chyle to the Breasts, from whence some small branches are reflected about the Calvicles, towards the Breasts. Image 18 (page 16) Women with Child have Milk in their Breasts, and especially in a few days before Delivery, not because the menstruous Blood regurgitates from the Womb through the Epigastric Vessels to the Breasts, for these do not at all communicate one with another; and Circulation refutes this: Besides, some Virgins have Milk, yea Men and Children; and many Animals which have not the Courses; but the reason is, for that in Women with Child, the Child growing big, the Womb is wonderfully expanded, and so the sanguiferous Vessels of the lower Belly are press'd; and therefore the Blood regurgitates upwards, and thereby its quantity and heat, opens the Pores of the Glands of the Breasts, and causes the lacteal Tubes to expand more; and for the same reason, the receptacles of the Chyle are more pressed, and the Chyle is more forceably driven upwards, and so opens more the glands and passages of the Breasts, and the lacteal Tubes. The Milk after Delivery flows more freely; for the Chyle that used to be carried to the Womb for the Nourishment of the Child, regurgitates upwards, the passages of the Womb being stopt: Besides, the Infant sucks; and how much that conduces to the production of Milk, none will wonder that reads in History, that Milk has bin drawn to the Breasts of Virgins, by continual Suction alone. The Milk at length ceases, either because the Child is wean'd, or because the Nurse is with Child, and then the Chyle begins to return to the Womb, for nourishment of the Foetus; and continues this course till the Womb being more distended, towards the end of gravidation, presses the Vessels of the Chyle. The cause that Children newly born, Old Women, and Men, have Milk in their Breasts, are the largeness of the passages of the Breasts, the laxity of the Glands, and the abundance of Chyle. Page 17 Seed is a whitish Humour turgid with Spirits, bred in the Stones, and Prostatae, and further elaborated for Generation in the carrying Vessels, and the small Seminal Bladders. The Matter of it is Blood carried on both Sides, from the Trunk of the Aorta, in a strait Passage by the Arteries to the Stones, and there put off thro the small Glands that are only visible by a Microscope upon the tubulous Substance of the Stones; this is confirm'd by the artificial Division and Dispersion of the Arteries in the Stones, and Prostata, and by the Straitness of them, together with the Wreathing of the corresponding Veins, and the Multitude of Valves, for these are so framed, that the Blood may pass quicker to the Stones, than from them, and that the nobler Part of the Blood may the easier sweat throught to the tubulous Substance of the Stones from the small Glands and Arteries every where join'd to it, for the making of Seed. Moreover, it appears hence, viz. because those that are of a Sanguine Complexion abound most with Seed, But some will have the nervous Juice to be the Matter of it, for these Reasons, because they perceive many Nerves in the Testicles, and that the taking away of a great Quantity of Blood, does not so much weaken a Man, as the Loss of a little Seed, and that after Coition, the Head akes, and that such as are given to Venery, are subject to Distillations from the Brain on the Spinal Marrow. And lastly, because the Testicles are white, not red� To the first I answer, that the nervous Juice is either Animal Spirit condensated, or another Humour: But the Nature of a Spirit which hath Particles that quickly fly away, cannot condensate into a Seminal Humour, and the nervous Juice can be no other Humour, for if it were, it wou'd stop the Passage of the Nerves. To the second I answer, this is manifest to Sense, and they convey a great many Spirits, which ought to be in the Seed, without which Image 19 (page 18)the Blood could not pass through those innumerable and narrow Tubes which are in the Testicles, nor be changed into prolific Seed, which ought to be made by the various Motion of the Spirits, and the Particles of it, and the working of them among themselves. To the third, fourth, and fifth, I answer, that it may be easily understood that this happens only by the Loss of Animal Spirits; for the Testicles being emptied, the Nerves proportionably, at least those which are near, are also emptied, and then by Reason of the greater Facility of the Motion towards them, Spirits flow more abundantly into them, and so the other Parts, and also the Brain are robb'd, and upon this Account the Fibres are disordered, and the Brain becoming cold, condenses the Vapours, and puts them off on the Spine. To the sixth I answer, that all the Parts and the Testicles also are nourished with Blood, and yet all are somewhat white. Seed begins to be generated about Puberty, because the Heat of the Glands of the Testicles being then greater, opens more the Arteries and small Vessels, and drives the Blood better through them, and the Nerves are readier to carry Spirits. The Seed is of an Ashy Colour in the Tubes of the Testicles, but whiter in the Head of the Epydidimidis, it is made in the Testicles and Prostatae, and is conveyed by the carrying Vessels by a very small and winding Duct to the Seminal Bladders, wherein it is kept, and further elaborated, till by Titillation the Nerves and Fibres about the Sides of them, being much inflated, press out the Seed, which is then very turgid with Spirit, into the Urethra, through the Holes of the Gland that stops the Seminal Bladders. The Stones are the Shop of the Seed, and therefore Eunuchs have not Seed, but some Titillation they have, by reason of a certain Humour that drops from the Prostatae into the Urethra, but this is not true Page 19Seed. And yet Eunuchs may have Seed in the Seminal Vessels sufficient for Copulation once or twice, and may impregnate a Woman. Those which do not indulge themselves in Venery, and live chastely, do not generate much Seed, for the Passages are narrowed by degrees, and the Seminal Matter turns back, and nourishes and makes fat the Loins and other Parts. Women have prolifick Seed, if by that you understand the Eggs whereof their Testicles are full, which being made fruitful, and expanded by the Man's Seminal Air, break out of the Cups wherein they are chiefly contain'd, into the Fallopian Tubes, and from thence into the Cavity of the Womb. That Humour which Women emit in Copulation, is not true Seed, because that is ejected without, about the Clytoris and Orifice of the Privities, and never into the Womb; this is manifest in big-bellied Women, the Orifice of whose Womb is always close shut, and cover'd with a yellow Mucilage. And besides, many Women conceive, and yet, as they say, have not emitted that Humour: Moreover, it has seldom the Consistence of Seed, nor is it Spirituous, because Whores copulating often in a Day, are not weakened by the Excretion of it, nor is it elaborated as Seed, for it is not generated in the Organs of it, but in the Glands. The Furrows of the Womb emit this Humour, or certain Ducts opening into the Sheath from the Prostatae or other Glands of the Womb, by Reason of Titillation, and the Constriction of the Fibres of the Womb, which happens in Coition. And yet this Humour is profitable, because it perpetually moistens the Sheath, and perhaps it conduces to the Elevation of the Man's Seminal Spirit or Air from the Sheath to the Cavity of the Womb, and from thence to the Eggs to make them fruitful. Image 20 (page 20) Menstruous Blood, is Blood abounding in the Body, which is evacuated by the Womb Monthly. The chief Cause is the abounding of the Blood at a certain Time, Heat and the easie Dilatation of the Womb also help. That a Plenitude is the Cause may be proved, for that they that have most Blood, evacuate most this way, and then rustic Women, that consume much Blood by Labour, have little or no menstruous Flux, and those who have lost much Blood by Venefaction, have few or no Courses at all: Men also who do not abound with Blood, by Reason of Labour and more Heat, have no such Flux. But there are some Women who Monthly evacuate Blood by the Nostrils, Hemorrhoids, or other Parts. Those Women that are hot have the Courses sooner, but in a less Quantity, and not so long as those that are cold. Some say the Cause of the Courses is a certain Saline Ferment of the Womb, being gradually deposited on the Substance of it, whereby the Womb collecting much Fire in it self, is turgid, rarefied, and dilated, grows hot, and evacuates the more fluid Blood, until that Ferment is carried off, and this Ferment they say is manifest from those things which move the Courses, for they consist of much volatile Salt. According to these Causes the Courses begin to slow about the fourteenth Year, because the Body then having in a manner its due Magnitude, the Blood begins to abound, and to be luxuriant in the Womb and other Parts, and hence the Breasts grow big, the Womb is less wrinkled, and does not press its Arteries so much, and a greater Heat exagitates the Blood more violently, dilates the Arteries, and opens them. The Courses ordinarily stop about the fiftieth Year, partly by the Defect of Blood and Heat, and partly upon the Account of the Narrowness and Driness of its Passages. Page 21 The menstruous Blood is brought first to the Sheath of the Womb, and not to the Bottom of it, for it sometimes flows in Women with Child, and if it shou'd drop from the Bottom, it wou'd putrifie, and injure the Child and its Nourishment, and so occasion Abortion. The menstruous Blood does not stagnate in the Vessels of the Womb, but circulates as the other Bood does, for otherwise it wou'd become venomous, but it is thinner and hotter than the other Blood, and therefore being taken inwardly it forces the Courses. About the Time of the coming of the Courses, Pain and Tension and Heat are felt about the Spine and Hypogaster, because the Blood can't at first break through the Arteries. This menstruous Blood is Arterial, for only Arteries lead to the Womb; when it can't be expell'd by the Womb, it is sometimes ejected by the Lungs, Gums, Nostrils, or the like. It seldom slows in a Woman with Child, because it does not abound in them, partly because it is spent for the Increase of the Womb, and partly because Part of the Mothers Chyle goes to the Child. Yellow or natural excrementitious Choler is a yellow and bitter Humour, secreted from the Mass of Blood into the Gaul Bladder, or Porus Bilarius, it is separated by the Impulse of the Blood of the Vena porta, into the Glands of the Liver, which it passes through, by reason of the special Conformity of them, with its Particles, as to Magnitude and Figure, and it enters the Branches of the Gaul Bladder, and of the Porus bilarius, dispersed among the Branches of the Vena porta, which absorb the Choler from the Extremities and Pores of the said Gland. But Choler may come partly to the Gaul Bladder by the cystick Arteries, being strain'd through the small Glands placed betwixt the Tunics of the Bladder. From the Gaul Image 21 (page 22)Bladder and Porus Bilarius, 'tis driven by a Constriction of the Fibres, into the Ductus Cholidochus, inserted obliquely into the Duodenum. The Choler which comes from the Porus bilarius, is thicker, more feculent, and paler, than that which is in the Gaul Bladder, and the Choler in the Gaul Bladder; by reason of its Thinness, sweats through, and tinctures the neighbouring Parts. Particles of the Chyle and Blood that are Salinosulphureous, are the Matter of the Choler, being nearly joyn'd with the Serum, and by the further Coction in the Heart render'd acrid, and turn'd to Choler; which, by reason of their small Quantity, are not bitter, till they are separated, and for this reason fat things increase Choler, and such as are hottest are most choleric. The Use of it, according to the Opinion of some, is to dilute the Chyle, as well in the Intestines, that it may the easier pass the Mouths of the lacteal Veins, as in the thoracic Duct, and they say, that the thinner and sweeter Part of it accompanies and heats the Chyle, lest coming too cold to the Heart, it shou'd stop the Rarefaction in it: And they say, that the grosser Part of it is evacuated with the Excrements, which it tinges and dilutes, but it may be well doubted whether Choler can accompany the Chyle in the Thoracic Duct, and whether all of it shou'd not rather be expell'd with the Excrements by Stool, for the Chyle in the thoracic Duct, and in the other lacteal Vessels is sweet like Milk: And on the contrary, a great Quantity of Milk will grow bitter with a few Drops of Choler, yet it is certain that Choler does continually drop from the Ductus Cholidochus into the Duodenum. But it is supposed that the chief Use of Choler, is to ferment the Chyle that passes from the Stomach, the pancreatic Juice being mixt with it in the Duodenum, Page 23that the Dissolution of the Chyle, which was imperfect in the Stomach, may be perfected in the Intestines; and it appears to Sight, that Choler dropt upon Dough, ferments it: Moreover, it melts and cleanses Crudities from the Guts, it heats them when they are chill'd by things taken in, it drives away Putrefaction from this Sink of the Body, and kills Worms, and expells them; and is also the Cause of the peristaltic Motion, whereby the Chyle is moved through the Intestines, and the Excrements are evacuated, as it continually irritates and provokes the Spirits from the Brain to the Fibres of the Guts, as we see in divers other Cases, for the Intestines, Heart, Veins, Arteries, Urinary Bladder, Stomach, Gaul Bladder, the Membranes of the Brain, and the like, have a certain proper Perception, whereby their Fibres are successively stimulated to contract and dilate, and so we see the Guts of an Animal dissected, and yet warm, creep within themselves; and the Heart cut up, beats; and the Muscles of a dead Beast, touched with an acrid and pungent Liquor, contract. Natural excrementitious Melancholy, is that Part of the Humours that is so terrestrial, that it cannot nourish; it is commonly defined, a black and acid Humour, separated from the Blood in the Spleen, proper to contract the Stomach, and to excite Appetite; but there is no such black acid Humour in the Stomach, nor in the Spleen; and perhaps the Capillary Arteries can't admit of so gross an Humour; the Spleen of a living Dog has been cut out, and yet his Appetite has not been lessened, and he has grown fat: Moreover, the Spleen sends nothing to the Stomach, for this ought to be done by the short veiny Vessel, which is a Vein, viz. of the Spleen Vein; but the Valves hinder, as appears by Inflation; and it is repugnant to Circulation, for no Vein brings to any Part, except the Vena Porta, and the Vein of the Lungs. Image 22 (page 24) The Serum is the most watry Humour of the Blood, when it is separated, it has other Particles mixt with it, as saline, acid, and others, according to the Diversity whereof, it is called Lympha, Spittle, or is otherwise named, and so it is never pure. It serves as a Vehicle for the Blood and other Humours, to nourish the innermost Parts, by entring, expanding, and loosening the Pores. There is great Quantity of this Humour in the Body, by reason of the great Quantity of Liquids that we dayly take in. The Humour of the Pericardium, is a serous Humour contain'd in the Pericardium, the Matter of it is Serum, mixt sometimes with a little thin Blood that it brings with it, and is therefore somewhat like the Water, wherein Flesh has been washed, and sometimes it is like a Gelly, some nutritious Particles being mixt with it: From whence this Humour comes is disputed; some say it is a Vapour, which exhales from the Heart, and is cooled and condensed in the Pericardium. Some will have it come from the Glands of the Thymus that hang from the Throat to the Pericardium, but it comes both Ways, but especially by the Lymphatick Vessels; it does not come only from the Thymus, because the Thymus in Infants is proportionably the greatest, and in Progress of Years, is so lessened, that at the Time of Virility, and in the following Ages you can scarce find any thing besides Vessels and Nerves: The Use of this Humour is to cool and moisten the Heart, that it shou'd not be dry'd up by its continual Motion, it cools the Heart, as Water contain'd in a Pot does the Bottom of it, viz: by taking from it the Particles of Fire which easily pass through the strait Pores of it. As the Humour of the Pericardium is always renewed, so in like manner it is evaporated from the Pericardium, and is received into the Lungs, or Veins of the Throat, or Thymus. Page 25 Spittle is a serous Humour, that drops from the salivary Ducts, these Ducts are Vessels of their Kind, four of them are most noted, the two uppermost that take their Origine with various Branches from the parotid Glands, and at the Jaws run under the Skin with a manifest Orifice into the Mouth. The lowermost also proceed with divers Branches from maxillary Glands, whereof one that is greater, before it reaches the common Trunk, is carried under the digastric Muscle of the Jaws. The lower End on both sides under the Tip of the Tongue, near the Fore-Teeth, where are some Teats placed. The Matter of the Spittle is carried to these Glands by the Arteries: It distils, moreover, in all the Mouth, as from the Glands under the Tongue, and from the Almonds which have two clear Bladders placed near them, that receive the Serum, from the Glands, and pour it out into the Mouth: There is also, on both sides, a common large oval Sinus, that opens into the Mouth, which contains in its Fringe, two greater Sinus's, and several others, that are less, with other Glands, each whereof hath a small perforated Sinus in the Middle. By moistening the Tongue, Mouth, Palate, Oesophagus, and Aspera Arteria, it quenches Thirst, helps swallowing, and begins Chylification in the Mouth, for it participates of the Nature of the acid Humour of the Stomach; that is, it has some saline acid Particles incorporated with Serum, and therefore a Bolus of chewed Bread exposed to the Sun, turns to Chyle, and Pieces of Flesh sticking in the Teeth, grow white, yet Spittle alone is not sufficient for Chylification: It extracts a Tincture from Meats, and carries it to the Organ of tasting, and therefore without Spittle there wou'd be no Tast. The Spittle returns continually, with or without Chyle, to the Heart by the lacteal Veins. Image 23 (page 26) When we smell or see any thing that is pleasant, or greedily long for any thing, the Spittle waters the Mouth more plentifully, because the Nerves of the wandring Pair, do not only send Branches to the Ducts and salivary Glands, but also some to the olfactory and optick Nerves; upon which account a great Influx into these, affects also the Nerves of the wandring Pair, and so by a Contraction of the small Fibres, the Salivary Ducts are narrowed, and the Spittle is ejected. The rouling about of a Bullet, or the like, in the Mouth, quenches Thirst, because by moving the Tongue, we narrow the Ducts, and so press out the Spittle. Just as we are about to vomit, Spittle flows more abundantly from the Mouth, because the Stomach participates with the Maxillary Glands by the Branches of the Nerve of the sixth Pair, and its inner Tunick is continued to the Jaws and Palate, and so they are contracted by Sympathy, and cast forth their Humidity, and in the same manner vomiting is provoked by irritating the Membrane at the Beginning of the Oesophagus. The acid or digestive Humour of the Stomach, is an acid Humour, that distills continually from the Tunics of the Stomach; it may be proved there is such a thing, because 'tis often found in the Stomachs of Dogs that have been dissected, after they have fasted a while; and sometimes we belch it up in a Morning, though we are well, and after due Chylification, and the Teeth are often set on Edge in vomiting by this mixt with the Meat, and by taking Acids Chylification is further'd, and therefore there is an Acid in the Stomach, which is the Cause of Chylification. But you will say that I have only proved that there is an acid Juice in the Stomach, and not that it is natural; it may proceed from Chylification vitiated, as we Page 27often see it happens in a Morning after Surfeiting. Moreover, an Acid is the Cause of Obstructions and Coagulations in the Body, and it irritates the Nerves, and the like: And consequently 'tis not naturally in the Stomach. I answer, 'tis certain that some acid Humour must be generated in the Stomach, because there is scarce any Aliment that does not contain some Acid, and therefore the Generation of it is natural, though sometimes this Juice is too acid, or there is too great a Quantity of it, and then it much injures the Body: So Choler, though it be natural, if it be too much heighten'd, or abound too much, occasions Diseases. And 'tis probable that such a Juice sweats continually into the Intestines through their glandulous Tunic. The Matter of it is a serous Humour, mixt with acid Particles, but it is not natural excrementitious Melancholy, as was wont to be said; for it is thicker than that. Those acid Particles are made by the like in Aliments taken in, and therefore Acids eaten increase the Acid of the Stomach. The pancreatic Juice is a serous Humour that is poured out of the Pancreas into the Intestine. The Pancreas is a certain Body of many Glands, cover'd with a common membrane of Vessels and Nerves, the branches of them being fastened among themselves; it is transversly placed under the Stomach: One of the extremities of it is extended to the Spleen, the other is bound to the intestinum duodenum, and descends a little with it. The Pancreas has an excretory Vessel proper to it, consisting of many Branches, each whereof has annext to it, the Glands of the Pancreas; yea, it does in some sort receive them: It is commonly call'd the pancreatic Duct, and it is wont to be inserted in the same mouth with the ductus choliclochus, obliquely into the intestinum duodenum, or the beginning of the Jejunum. Image 24 (page 28) The Blood being carried by the Arteries, and force upon the Glands of the Pancreas, conveys the pancreatic Juice through the pores of them into the branches of the Duct; and from these branches it distills into the greater Duct, and thence into the Intestine, in a small quantity; for it can scarce be seen, when the Duct is bound in a living Dog. It has a sub-acid Tast, by reason its acid saline Particles are diluted with Serum; and when the Choler is poured on it, it occasions a Fermentation. The use of it is to ferment the Chyle with the Choler in the Intestine: Moreover, it attemperates the Choler, that it should not hurt the Intestine; and it dilutes the Chyle. Lympha is a lympid serous Humour, contain'd in the Lymphatic Vessels. These Lymphatic Vessels are very small and pellucid, and they arise almost from every part of the Body, and absorb the Liquor of them; and that they may pass the safer, they here and there encircle the greater Vessels (as may be seen in the Limbs and Vena Porta near the Liver) like Ivy. As far as we can learn by the Constitution of the Valves, and by Ligature and Inflation, the Lymphatic Vessels that are below the Diaphragm, chiesly end in the common receptacle of the Chyle, the rest above the Diaphragm, are inserted at the concourse of the Jugular with the Axillary, into the upper part of the thoracie Duct, and Pericardium; and there they discharge their Lympha by manifest passages, defended with a Valve; here and there they cannot be seen, because on the account of Tenuity, the parts under appear through those Vessels, and we can't easily distinguish them, especially if the parts are white; but sometimes the Lympha is a little red or yellowish, and then they appear the better, and also after the Death of a Creature; for then the Vessels are more distended, by reason the motion of the Lympha is slow. Page 29 The use of the Lympha is to dilute the Chyle in the Receptacle, that it may the easier ascend through the thoracic Duct; and in the Jugular Vein, it renders the venous Blood that is deprived of its own Serum more fluxile, that it may the easier rarifie in the Heart; and it restores the humour of the Pericardium. The slime of the Guts is a viscid and glutinous Matter that covers the Guts within; the Stomach has some of it, but it is most in the Guts. The Matter of it is a phlegmatic Humour, carried by the Arteries to the glandulous Tunick of the Intestines; and being separated through it from the Blood, sweats into the Cavity of the Intestines. The use of this Slime is to defend the Nervous Tunic against the acrimony and roughness of the Choler, and of things taken in; and probably because it partakes of Acidity it conduces to Chylification. When Choler, or a purging Medicine is very Acrid, the Slime is melted or rubb'd off, to the great prejudice of the Patient; for Gripes and the bloody Flux are occasion'd thereby. Sweat is a serous Humour breaking through the sudorisic Vessels of the Skin, in form of Water. These Vessels are small Tubes in the Pores running out to the Cuticle, and each of them has a Gland under, through which the Serum, the Matter of Sweat is separated, they may be seen with a Microscope. Sweat by reason of salt Particles mixt with it, is Salt. The efficient cause of natural Sweat is Heat, viz. Of the Sun, of the Fire, Exercise, Coverings, and the like, whereby the Blood is more agitated and diffused through the habit of the Body; and the mouths of the Arteries near the Skin are more opened, and the serous Particles that are more flexile, and that stick less to others, run out of them; and if there be any Humidity in the Skin, they carry it off with them through Image 25 (page 30)the Pores of the Skin; but because they do not pass free enough, and quick enough, many of their particles being heapt together, are condensed into drops for otherwise they would pass by insensible Transpiration, as always some thin part does in Sweating. From what has bin said, it appears that plenty of Serum, and a moderate apertion of the Pores, conduce much to Sweat; but that too great an apertion of the Pores, because it does not at all hinder the Flux of the Serum, conduces most to insensible Transpiration, and too great a Constriction of the Pores hinders Sweating; but when 'tis once begun, it much increases it: And hence Sweat occasion'd in Winter by Exercise, is much more than in Summer. We Sweat more sometimes after cleansing the Face, because the Pores are freed from the Sweat that obstructs them. Sweat is suppressed by sitting near the Fire, because the Pores are thereby enlarged, and the Vapours fly away insensibly; and this is also the reason why Sweat sooner goes off when we sit still in the Sun, than under the Shade of a Tree; and also why he Sweats more that runs in the Shade, than he that runs in the Sun. We Sweat most in the Arm-pits and Groins, because those parts being most cover'd, the Vapours are more retain'd. We Sweat when we Sleep, because then we are either oppressed with Clothes, or at least, cover'd with them all over; and because the animal Spirits in Sleep do not sufficiently flow to the outer Parts and Muscles, and so the Vapours stay about the Skin, or by reason of the covering do not sufficiently fly away. Smiths and Rustic People seldom Sweat, because by their Filth the Pores are shut. Our Hands and Feet Sweat most, because in them the Arteries are carried straiter to the Skin, and their Mouths are more open there, that the Blood may return to the Veins, and Page 31on this account the Serum is put off there more plentifully. It has bin observed, that a person Drinking plentifully of Spanish Wine, has render'd his Sweat like it; but this proceeded from too great a quantity, whereby the heat of the Heart being almost suffocated, cou'd scarce change it. Our blessed Saviour in the Garden Sweat Blood, partly out of Love to us, and his most holy Father; his Blood did so Ferment that it could not be contain'd in the Arteries, and partly by reason of Sorrow unto Death, there was so great Horrour and Collision of the Parts, that Blood was violently press'd out of the Pores. But ordinarily Blood does not Sweat out of the Pores, because it is too ramous; but yet sometimes naturally, some small particles of Blood do accompany Sweat, and then the Sweat discolours the Linen, especially in the Arm-pits. Urine is a serous Humour strain'd in the Reins, which comes with the Blood (which it diluted) to the Reins by the Arteries of the Kidnies, but is separated from it as superstuous, and that continually, as part of the Blood is continually driven to the Reins to nourish them. It is strein'd in the Reins in the following manner; the Blood mixt with the Serum forces upon the glandulous substance of the Reins, and by this impulse, presently some thin particles are separated through the Pores of it into many small Tubes, whereof chiefly consists the inner substance of the Reins; and from these ending for the most part in eight or nine papillary Caruncles, they pass into the Pelvis, and thence into the Ureters and Bladder; the rest which came to the Reins, returns partly to the Vena Cava by the emulgent Veins, and dilutes, and carries the Blood as before. Besides, the Serum of the Blood Choler is mixt with the Urine, and tinctures it of a yellowish Colour, and Image 26 (page 32)also other particles from the Mass of Blood: For itstance, some nutritive particles of Blood rubb'd off or melted, Sulphureous, Saline, fixed, incorporated with terrestrial Particles, and the like, which by washing the parts it carries off. Some say, that part of the potulent Matter, or of another Liquor taken in, is the Matter of Urine; and they say, it does not come by the Arteries, but by some nearer way: For instance, presently from the Stomach or Bowels, by some special Ducts running to the Ureters or Bladder, and they tely on these reasons, viz. We presently make Water after drinking, especially of the Spaw-Waters, and the Urine has sometimes the colour and tast of what we take in, These Reasons indeed are probable, but they do not prove the thing for which they are used; for first, such passages have not hitherto been found out by Anatomists; and the making of Water so soon after Drinking, may be understood without the supposition of such passages; and in this manner, because a potulent Liquor drank plentifully, presently increases the flux of the Scrum to the Reins, partly because flowing presently from the Stomach to the Intestines, and from thence to the lacteal Veins, it thrusts forwards the Chyle, previously existing as well in them as in the thoracic Duct, and so the Serum is increased in the Mass of Blood; partly because large Drinking distends the Stomach and Bowels, and so presses the sanguiferous Vessels of the Bowels, and so the Blood, with its Serum, abounds in other Vessels; and therefore to make free passage for it self, it puts off its Serum, which by reason of its tenuity, easily passes the Reins; and indeed, though the Drink must pass before it be evacuated through the Stomach, Guts, lacteal Veins, thoracic Duct, and other parts, that it may come with the Blood to the Reins, yet it may be easily understood how it comes to pass, that we make Page 33Water so soon after Drinking. For first, that which we void by Urine presently after Drinking, is not the Drink; for if it were, it wou'd retain the Smell and Tast, especially when some odoriferous and tincturing thing is taken in; and it wou'd appear crude and unconcocted, as that we evacuate by Urine the second or third time after Drinking. But that which was before in the Thoracic Duct, or in the Veins or Arteries is thrust forward by it: And then the potulent Matter runs its Course soon enough; and 'tis very probable that the Blood in any healthy Man, finishes its Course in a Quarter of an Hours time, so that 'tis no such strange thing that we make Water so soon after Drinking, yet 'tis not so very soon as is said, unless the Bladder were distended with Urine before. As to the Smell and Colour, which sometimes the Urine has from things that are taken in, as we see when Asparagus or Madder are eat, these are not also sufficient Proofs for particular Passages, for this may be because things taken in do not continue long enough in the Blood, so as to wholly put off their Qualities in it; and this is so much the more, by how much the said things that are odoriferous, and that give a Tincture, are more aperitive: Moreover, some Historians relate, that a Person, after drinking a large Quantity of Spanish Wine, has sweat it out in Colour and Tast as before, and therefore it may be as reasonably expected that we shou'd shew particular Passages in this Case, as for the Urine, when it has the Qualities of the Liquor taken in, and yet there are hitherto no such Passages found out for the Sweat. But I wou'd not be so understood, as that I wou'd wholly reject particular Passages, for that there are such is very plausible, and I hope they will be found out at one time or another, by the Industry of the modern Anatomists. Image 27 (page 34) The Urine falling continually from the Reins through the Ureters to the Bladder, is retain'd in it, until by the Quantity or Quality, it stimulates to Excretion. It is evacuated by a Contraction of the Muscles of the Belly, and of the Fibres of the Bladder, whilst they being irritated, the Spirits flow more plentifully into them; and how great the Contraction of the Bladder is, may be seen in the Dissection of a Beast; which, when it is vastly expanded, after Evacuation of the Urine, sinks into a very small Compass: Lest the Urine shou'd flow out when we are sleeping, or involuntarily, a great round Muscle is placed before the Neck of the Bladder, call'd Sphincter; such an one a is at the End of the right Gut, for retaining the Excrement; and therefore to make Water, we contract the Belly and Bladder so much, as to somewhat overcome the Action of the Sphincter, which is perpetua Contraction. The Urine cannot return again from the Bladder to the Ureters, because they are obliquely inserted within the Membranes of the Bladder, and so when it lyes up on them it shuts their Passages. In a Calf, and the like, all the time they are in the Womb, the Urine is evacuated through the upper Part of the Bladder, but not so in an Humane Foetus, which either voids it into the Womb, or it is kept it the Bladder all the time the Child is in the Womb. We make more Water in the Winter than in the Summer, and so being placed in cold Water, because by the Stoppage of the Pores insensible Transpiration is hindred, and the Serum is diverted to the inner Parts. Tears are a serous Humour, flowing from the Eye of those that weep: The Matter of them is a Vapour; and salt Serum, continually brought through the Arteries with the Blood, to the weeping Glands, to lubricate and moisten the Eye, and through them sequestered Page 35into the weeping Ducts, which are very numerous in the Eye-lids. Serum flowing in too great a Quantity to the Eye: Also Collyria sometimes running through the Nostrils and Palate, through the weeping Gland, placed in the greater Angle of the Eye, that is very spongy, and through three or four Holes of the Bone of the Nose, are tasted in the Mouth; through these Holes the Rayes of the Sun enter partly the Nostils, when looking on the Sun we sneeze. Our Eyes water upon the account of a Moat, Ash, Smoak, Onions, Garlic, and the like; because by reason of these, Pain being occasion'd in the Eye, there is a greater Flux of Blood than is usual, and a proportionable Separation of Serum; or because, by reiterated Contractions of the Belly, then intervening, the Bowels press more the Aorta, and the Blood, with its Serum, is more moved upwards, and for the same reason in other Pains; in Trumpeting, Coughing, sneezing, drinking, and the like, our Eyes water. In Sorrow Tears flow, partly because by reason of a lesser Influx of the Spirits, the Pores of the Eye fall down, and the Vapours gather together; partly, because now and then, by reason of interluding Love or Joy, without which there is no Sorrow, the Blood being driven generously through the Body, puts off its Serum more largely on the weeping Ducts. Snot is a clammy and viscid Humour sticking to the Nostrils; the Matter of it comes from the internal Arteries of the Nostrils; or it may be a flegmatic Humour pour'd out of the Arteries upon the Brain, and may pass from thence through the Os Cribrosum into the Nostrils, and grow thick there by the Cold, or by alternate Expiration and Inspiration of the Air, whereby its thin Particles are dry'd up; for the Mamillary Processes are hollow to the Ventricles that are Image 28 (page 36)before: And part of it may be also a Vapour condensed in the Nostrils; but it does not come, as is said, through the Hole of the Bone of the Skull to the Palate, for here are no Passages for it, but all the Humour coming from the Ventricles to the Infundibulum, and pituitary Gland, is refunded through the Membrane under the Gland that is pervious with many small Holes, into the jugular Veins that are placed on each side of the Cella turcica. If we expire, or inspire strongly, the Mouth being shut, the Snot is carried with the Air to the Nostrils from the Palate; and so on the contrary. The Blood of a Woman in Child-bed, is Blood whereby the Woman is purged in her lying in. Childbed is the Time from Delivery, to the Purification of the Woman. The Water of a Woman in Delivery, is that which flows from the Womb at the Time of Delivery: The Matter of it is the Urine, Sweat, and superfluous Chyle of the Child contain'd in the Amnion, it flows out when the Child, by kicking, breaks the Membranes, and sometimes a long while before the Child is born; but it is better not to break so, for by lubricating the Passages, it facilitates the Birth. The hemorrhoidal Blood is a Portion of Blood abounding, which is carried off by the hemorrhoidal Arteries, and it serves in Men as the Courses in Women. A Spirit is the thinnest and most agile Part of the Body; the Matter of it is the finest, that is, the most sulphureous Part of the Blood: That there is such a thing as Spirit, may be proved; because, if you bind or cut off the Nerve of any Part, so as that the Spirit can't come to it, the Motion and Sense of it presently perish. Spirit is commonly divided into animal, vital, and natural; but I suppose there is but one Spirit; which, Page 37because it performs animal Actions, is animal; which moves when it flows into the medullary Part of the Nerve, which serves for Motion; it gives Sense when it flows upon the Membrane which serves for Sense, and it is vital as it performs vital Actions, and natural as it performs natural Actions; and so the rest without any specific Distinction. Animal Spirit is generated in the Head only, by Separation from the Blood when it forces thro the Branches of the carotid Arteries, upon the external Substance of the Brain and Cerebellum, that is more lax than the rest; presently the finest Particles recede from it into the Pores of the Brain and Cerebellum. The Spirit makes its Excursions from the Brain three ways: First, By the Command of the Mind. Secondly, 'tis expell'd by the Contraction of the Heart, that forces the Blood upon the Brain and Cerebellum; and new Spirits being presently separated from it, force by the wole Diastole of the Brain, and partly by the Systole, the animal Spirits previously existing in the Brain, into the Beginning of the Nerves; and this Motion of the Spirits is moderate and slow, and thereby the Tension of all the Muscles is equal; and hence it is manifest, why by every Pulse there is a Concussion of the whole Body, tho this may also proceed from the Blood continually thrust into the Arteries. 'Tis manifest also, why one Arm being cut off, the other grows strong thereupon, and why to one of two antagonist Muscles the other is convulsively drawn, and which way it is drawn, it carries the Part with it: viz. because then the said Parts are puffed up and extended with a greater Quantity of Spirits. Thirdly, The Spirit flows from the Brain when any Part is irritated; for then, by the Motion of the small Fibres of the Nerves, the Pores in the Brain are opened; and so in Respiration, in the Motion of the Heart, in the peristaltic Motion, and the like; wherein Image 29 (page 38)there is a certain natural Irritation, and so it flows when some Member being tickled or irritated, is sometimes otherwise drawn, but then the Irritation is preternatural. But by reason of such an Apertion of the Pores of the Brain, this Efflux of Spirits is such, that it does not only fall upon the Nerves of the Part irritated, but also upon the neighbouring Nerves; and this is the chief Cause of Sympathy, which is observed in divers Parts; for Instance, betwixt the Reins and Stomach, by reason whereof, those being irritated, vomiting is occasion'd; and so betwixt the Colon and the Stomach, as when that is affected the Patient vomits. The Spirits serving involuntary Actions, come chiefly from the Cerebellum, and the medullary Furrows from the Cerebellum, to the Nerves of the wandring Pair, shew this; and this is the Reason why, in an Apoplexy, the Pulse and Respiration do not quite cease, which is partly performed by those Nerves. The Spirits, in their natural State, being about to cause Motion, are not fired like Gun-powder in the Brain, or exploded thence: For if so, Motion cou'd not be restrain'd at any Time when we wou'd. The Spirit conduces somewhat to the Nutrition of the Parts, by separating their Fibres, and the Sides of the Pores from one another, and so by making way for the Blood.   CHAP. V. Of Parts in general. A Part is a Body cohering to the Whole, fitted for the Function and Use of it; I do not add, joined by the common Life, as some do, that they may Page 39exclude the Hair, Nails, Humours, and Spirits, which are all truly Parts; for as to the Hairs and Nails, they shew Life as other Parts do which are nourished, and they grow with all Dimensions, according as other Parts do, by receiving Nourishment inwardly, and by applying it to Parts that are deficient, and not only by placing it at the Root, for the Nails have small Arteries, and the Hairs are hollow, and for the most part triangular, as the Microscope shews, and in the plica polonica they sweat out Blood: It matters not that the Hairs grow upon tabid People, and on such as are dead, for in them there is a Dissolution or Colliquation of the Body, which makes the Hairs grow most, by yielding an agreeable Nourishment, viz. a sat Vapour exhaling from the Body, as appears from the Inflammability, the fat Fume, and Odor of them; also from that oyly and clammy Matter that sticks to the Hairs, if they are not frequently cleans'd. Lastly, They are profitable; for, by keeping the Pores of the Skin open, they conduce to the Expulsion of a sooty Excrement, as when a Stick is fixt in the Earth, the Earth about it is dryer. On the Eye-lids, they defend the Eyes, and those on the Head defend it, and the like. The Nails are to strengthen the Fingers, and render them capable to apprehend small things. But the Humours and Spirits do not grow, do not live, nor increase vitally, but only by the Apposition of new Matter, as Rain-water is increased in a Tub, and yet notwithstanding the Humours are Parts; and indeed, the most noble and most necessary, as well as the watry Humour of the Eye, which almost all allow to be a Part, tho it is not nourished and grows. All the solid Parts are of themselves white, as appears by the washing and Maceration of them in Water, whereby they put off the Tincture of the Blood, with which they are all nourished. Image 30 (page 40) First, Parts are divided into fluid and solid; the fluid are the Blood and Spirits, the solid all that are distinct from them. Secondly, They are divided into organic, and inorganic. An organic Part is a Part which requires a special Conformation, for performing the Action it is peculiarly design'd, as the Eye, Ear, Nose, and the like. An inorganic Part is a Part which does not require a special Conformation for performing the Action it is peculiarly designed, as simple Flesh, a Membrane. I say, the Action for which it is peculiarly design'd, because, as to the common Actions, in all the Parts, for instance Nutrition, no determinate Conformation is required. Thirdly, A Part is divided into Principal and Ministring: The principal Part is that which bestows something on the whole Body, that is absolutely necessary to Life. The ministring Part is that which does not bestow any thing on the whole Body that is absolutely necessary to Life. The principal Parts (at least among the Solids, for among the Fluids, Blood and Spirits are such) are the Brain, which bestows Spirits on the whole Body, and the Heart, which bestows Blood on the whole Body; for if the Heart should not give Blood, the Brain would presently suffer an Eclipse of all its Actions, and other Parts could not live without this; and if the Brain should not supply the Heart with Spirits, whereby it is successively constringed, Death would soon follow. The other Parts minister, especially those which carry, for instance, the Veins, Arteries, and Nerves: The Stomach, Liver, Lungs, and Stones, are falsly accounted by some, principal Parts, for they do not supply any thing that is absolutely necessary to Life; for we live many Days fasting, or only with nourishing Glysters, and divers know how Page 41to stop their Breath a great while, and the Liver supplies no more than other Parts, and the Testicles, tho they make Life more perfect, yet are not absolutely necessary to Life, as is evident in Eunuchs and Geldings. Fourthly, A Part is wont to be divided by the Schools, into similar and dissimilar. A similar is such an one whereof all the Parts appear, at first View, of the same Substance. A dissimilar is such an one whereof all the Parts do not appear, at first View, of the same Substance. I say, at first View, because otherwise, many that are wont to be reckon'd similar, are not such, for there are very few wherein you shall not observe a diverse Substance. A Bone, a Cartilage, a Fibre, a Membrane, the Cuticle, Skin, Hair, Flesh, a Tendon, a Gland, Fat, a Nerve, an Artery, a Vein, lymphatic Vessels, the lacteal Veins, and the like, are counted similar Parts. Fifthly, a Part is divided into spermatic, sanguine, and mixt; a spermatic Part is wont to be defined a Part, whose Matter is wholly, in its first Formation, Seed. A sanguineous Part is a Part, whose Matter is wholly, in its first Formation, Blood. A mixt Part is a Part, which is made, in its first Formation, of an equal Portion of Blood and Seed. I say, in its first Formation, because it is certain, that in the adult they chiefly consist of Blood, wherewith they are all nourished. A Bone, a Cartilage, a Nerve, a Fibre, a Tendon, a Membrane, an Artery, a Vein, the Marrow of the Brain, the Hairs, Nails, and the like, are counted spermatic: Also the fourfold Flesh, viz. the Flesh of the Muscles, which is generated of Blood, lightly concreted, and is red and fibrous: The Flesh, or Parenchyma of the Viscera, which is the proper Substance of each of them, as of the Reins, Spleen, Liver, and Lungs; the Vessels whereof it strengthens, and fills up Image 31 (page 42)their void Spaces, the particular Flesh of every membranous Part, as that of the Stomach, Intestines, Womb, Bladder, and the like. Lastly, the glandulous Flesh, which constitutes the Glands. The Flesh is counted mixt, but whether all the Parts of it are such, so as that some of them are only compounded of Seed, and others only of Blood, and others of equal Parts of both, I much doubt. Sixthly, A Part is wont to be divided, from its Office, into animal, vital, and natural: An animal Part is a Part that is principally design'd for the performing animal Functions, such are the animal Spirit, the Brain, spinal Marrow, Nerves, Eye, Ear, Nose, Tongue, with the Palate, the membranous, and nervous Parts, and the like, which conduce to animal Actions. A vital Part is a Part principally contrived for vital Functions; such are the Heart and Lungs. A natural Part is a Part principally contrived for natural Functions; Such are the Stomach, Guts, Liver, Spleen, Pancreas, Genital Parts, and the like.   CHAP. VI. Of a Faculty in general, and of the Species of it. A Faculty in general, is an internal Principle that formally produces Actions. Three more general are commonly allowed, viz. The animal Faculty, the vital Faculty, and the natural Faculty; but I allow only two of them, viz. the animal Faculty, and the natural, as every Action that is not animal, is truly natural. An animal Faculty is a Faculty producing animal Actions: This is wont to be subdivided, as the animal Page 43Action, into the sensitive, appetitive, and motive Faculty; and the sensitive again into external and internal: But all these do not differ really among themselves, and a parte rei, are the very Soul, considered as the Efficient of this or that Operation. The natural Faculty is a Faculty producing natural Actions: It is as various as natural Actions are, and is a parte rei, Blood and Spirits, and other Dispositions of the Parts, as to Magnitude, Figure, and the like, as they produce natural Actions.   CHAP. VII. Of Action in general, and its Species, but especially of the internal and external Senses. ACtion in general is a certain Operation, which is produced in us, either by the Mind or Body: It is divided into animal and natural. An animal Action is an Action that is produced by the Soul, and is fivefold, viz. the Understanding, the Will, Sense, sensitive Appetite, and animal Motion. Sense is twofold, external and internal. Internal is threefold, viz. common Sense, Fancy, and Memory. External is fivefold, viz. Sight, Hearing, Tasting, Smelling, and Touching. All these animal Actions are not really distinguished from the Soul, nor consequently among themselves; for the Understanding is the Soul, as it independently, from the Body, produces certain Thoughts; and the Will is the Soul, as without Dependence on the Body, it exercises those Affections, which we call the Operations of Will; and the Sense is the Soul, as it knows some things by means of a corporeal Organ; and it is internal, if the Organ of it is the Brain, and external Image 32 (page 44)if any other Part be the Organ: It is Sight, if the Organ of it be the Eye; and Hearing, if the Organ of it be the Ear: It is the common Sense, as in the Brain, but especially in the middle Part of the Medulla oblongata, it perceives whatever moves the Organs of the external Senses; this is only conversant about things present. It is Fancy or Imagination, as it perceives sensible Objects at a Time wherein they are not perceived by the external Senses, and forms Images and Representations of them, otherwise called Phantasms. It is Memory, as by the Footsteps of the Spirits impressed upon the Brain, it is determined for Remembrance. Lastly, The sensitive Appetite is the Soul, as upon occasion of a certain Motion of the animal Spirits in the Brain, it is disposed to have these Affections we call Passions, for instance, Love, Desire, Hope, Fear, Hatred, and the like: The Action also, whereby the Soul moves the Spirits, is really the Soul it self.   CHAP. VIII. Of animal Motion, and of the Species of natural Action. ANimal motion is a motion performed by the Will, whereby the animal Spirits which always run about the Brain are in readiness for an influx, and presently flow into the beginnings of the Nerves, and there protrude the Spirits previously existing to the Muscle, which blow up the Fibres of it, and so make it shorter and more compact; and so the Member into which it is inserted is moved. Natural Actions are various: The chief are the motion of the Heart, the Pulse, the Circulation of the Blood, Respiration, Hunger, and Thirst, Chylification, Sanguification, Page 45the peristaltic Motion, Nutrition, Accretion, and Generation. The motion of the Heart is Muscular; for it is constringed on every part by the duct of the Fibres, it is lessened and grows hard in its motion, in the same manner other Muscles do. It is two-fold, viz. Dilatation or Diastole, in respect of which the Heart is meerly passive; and Contraction or Systole, which is the action of the Heart. Both the Auricles of the Heart together, as the Ventricles of it, have their Systole and Diastole; but the Systole of them is the Diastole of the Ventricles; and so on the contrary. The Diastole of the Auricles does not so much depend on the rarefaction of the Blood, as the quantity of it; for the Blood is forced into them by great Veins. The Diastole was before the Systole, or otherwise there would have been no Systole; and it partly depends upon the quantity of the Blood, and partly upon the fermentation and rarefaction of it by some subtile matter in the Heart, whereby the sides of the Heart are expanded. The Systole of the Heart is made by the influx of the Animal Spirits. The Pulse is an alternate dilatation and constriction of the Artery, by reason of the Bloods being forced into the Arteries. There are at least two Thousand Pulses in an hours time, in every healthy Man, as any one may find by numbering them; but they are much altered by the Passions of the Mind: They are quick in People that are angry, and in those that are chearful; and when we are labouring and running: They are slower in such as are sorrowful fearful, and the like. In Children the Pulse is quick, because the Heart is tender, and soon irritated, and their Arteries are easily dilated, and their Blood is thin, and soon rarifies. The Circulation of the Blood is a motion whereby the Blood continually flows thro' the Arteries from the Heart, and returns to it again by the Veins. This Image 33 (page 46)Circulation of the Blood is so obvious, that none needs doubt of it; for in bleeding in the Arm, a Quart of Blood, yea, the whole Mass may be drawn away, and it cannot be supposed that so much Blood was contained in the Arm. Circulation also is manifest from the Valves of the Veins, which are so disposed as to remit the Blood to the Heart, but not on the contrary. The manner of Circulation is as follows; the Blood is carried from the Vena cava, ascending and descending, to the right Auricle of the Heart, and thence to the right Ventricle of the Heart, and after it has been rarified in this Ventricle, it is conveyed into the Artery of the Lungs, and from thence into the Vein of the Lungs, and the left Auricle of the Heart, and so into the left Ventricle of the Heart, and then, after another Rarefaction of it there, it is driven into the Arteria Aorta ascending, and descending, and dispersed thro' the whole Body; and from thence again it is carried as before, thro' the corresponding Branches of the Vena cava, into the right Auricle of the Heart immediately, by Inosculation of the Branches, and Transudation from the Artery, into the adjoyning Vein, or mediately thro the middle Flesh, betwixt the veiny and arterial Branches, and thro' the Sinus's and their Branches in the Brain, where the Blood is absorbed from the Carotide and vertebral Arteries; and from these it is carried to the Juguiars. It is manifest that the Blood circulates thro' the Flesh, because, when it is pressed, it grows white, the Blood then flying away; but when that returns, it looks red as before. Moreover, in blushing, the Face looks red, the Blood flying to it. The Blood enters the Flesh by the fine simple and porous Tunics of the capillary Arteries, or thro' the Extremities of them. In a Foetus the Blood is otherwise circulated; namely, in part, from the Vena cava, thro' the foramen Page 47ovale, it passes into the Vein of the Lungs, nor does all pass thro' the right Ventricle of the Heart, but enters from the Artery of the Lungs into the Aorta, a membranaceous Tube being stretched from that to this, and so it does not pass again thro' the left Ventricle of the Heart. Another part goes the ordinary way. This other Motion of the Blood is rather in a Foetus than those that are born; in whom, after some Days, the said Passages are shut. The End of Circulation is the Nutrition of the Parts, the heating of the Body, and the Generation of the vital and animal Spirits, and to preserve the Blood from Coagulation. A certain Time cannot be set for the Circulation of the Blood, for it is less in hot People than in cold; because in these, by reason of a quicker Rarefaction of the Blood, the Heart is sooner irritated to constriction, whereby the Blood is driven out. The Time is also less in such as are in Motion, than in those that are quiet; because in such, by a Contraction of the Muscles, the Vessels are, by turns, more straitned, and the Blood flows quicker. Lower thinks the Blood circulates in an Hour. The Quickness of the Circulation of the Blood appears hence, viz. if one of the Carotide Arteries be only cut, all the Blood will flow out in the 12th. Part of an Hour, and if so, how soon would it run out if the Aorta were cut? Respiration is a Motion, whereby the Air is alternately drawn into the Lungs, and expelled out: It consists of Inspiration and Expiration. Inspiration is partly made by the Dilatation of the Breast, and partly by the elastick Force of the Air, and partly by the Pressure which it has from the Weight of the incumbent Atmosphere. The Breast is dilated chiefly by the internal and external intercostal Muscles. Expiration is made by the Constriction of the Breast and Lungs, also by the Heat and Rarefaction of the Air in the Lungs. Image 34 (page 48) Respiration is a spontaneous Action, because it is perform'd when we know nothing of it, but it is it some sort voluntary, because we can quicken or retard it as we will. The chief End of Respiration is Voice; to perform which there is need of Air: Besides, by this means some fuliginous and adust Particles are carried off. Those whose Lungs do not move freely, as crooked People, and the like, are subject to Consumptions; because their Lungs not being sufficiently dilated and contracted, cannot well free themselves from the fuliginous Vapours of the Blood, and other acrid and gross Particles, upon which account they are subject to Obstructions, and at length to Corruption. Divers can continue under Water a notable while without breathing, because they know how to fill themselves with Air before, and because they are less hot; but some say that they have a way of putting their Hands to their Mouth, and so to separate the Air from the Water. Hysteric Women are said to live a long while without breathing, yet I suppose they do breath, tho the Standers by do not perceive it, or at least, the Air passes of its own accord, into their Lungs, and out again, and this perhaps may suffice for them. The Motion of the Brain is the constant Motion of it made alternately by the Systole and Diastole, according to its Substance, and independent from the Meninges. Hunger is a troublesome Sense of Vellication in the Stomach, whereby we are disposed to crave for some solid thing to take it off. This Vellication proceeds from an Acid in the Stomach. We are more hungry in the Winter than in the Summer; because then the Ferment of the Stomach is more acrid, and, by reason of less Transpiration, more plentiful. Page 49 That an Acid is the Cause of Hunger is proved, because Acids increase it, and restore it when it is lost, and those things take it away, which destroy or attemperate an Acid; for instance, Crabs-eyes, Hartshorn calcined, Pear's, fat things, Spirit of Wine, and the like: If Hunger be continued long, it at length lessens of its own accord, because the Acid is dried up, or overwhelmed by other Humours drawn from the Stomach. Some think that Hunger is occasioned by Suction, whereby the Veins suck from the Liver, the Liver from the Guts, the Guts from the Stomach; but this is so vain, that it is scarce worth refuting, for there is no Suction in the Parts, much less such a continual one. Thirst is a troublesome Sense of Vellication in the Mouth and Jaws, whereby we are disposed to crave for some liquid thing to take it off; the Cause is Siccity, or a salt Humour or Vapour. We sometimes put off Thirst by holding in our Mouths a leaden Bullet, or the like, not because Humidity flows from these, but because, by the Motion of them and the Tongue, the salivary Ducts are more opened, and the Spittle flows out. Liquid things take off Thirst, by moistening and diluting the saline Particles. Spirit of Wine quenches the Thirst of Travellers at the Beginning, by opening the salivary Ducts, and by helping the Propulsion of Moisture, but it afterwards increases it. Chilification is the Conversion of Meat and Drink into Chile; it is chiefly made in the Stomach and Guts, but it begins in the Mouth. The efficient Cause of Chilification is partly Spittle, but especially some acid Humour. It is made in the following manner: Hard Meat is first chewed by the Teeth, and often turned about in the Mouth by the Motion of the Tongue, and by the Jaws and Lips, Image 35 (page 50)and is moistened with Spittle, and then is conveyed to the Stomach, partly by the Weight of it, and partly by the Contraction of the annular Fibres of the Oefophagus. If the Meat is solid, it is slowly dissolved in the Stomach; but if it is liquid, it is soon digested. The Stomach presently embraces the Meat on every side with its Fibres, and both its Orifices, at least the upper, is somewhat contracted, but both of them are somewhat shut, even when the Stomach is empty, lest any thing should regurgitate from the Guts to the Mouth, or the indigested Meat should fall into the Guts. This Closure is made by many carnous and nervous Fibres, wherewith both Orifices are composed in the manner of a nervous and carnous Ring, the Meat being included in the Stomach, is impregnated with Spittle, and the acid Humour that sweats out of the Sides of the Stomach, and sometime after it is bedewed with the Spittle and an acid Humour, it becomes spongy and porous in the Stomach, because now its Parts are fermented by subtle Matter; afterwards it appears torn into small Pieces, and at length the whole is reduced to the Consistence of Cream, and then Chylification is finished in the Stomach: But all Meat, and every Part of it does not turn to Chyle in the Stomach altogether: but the softer and finer, a little and well chewed is turned to Chyle soonest, Caeteris paribus; and therefore that which is eaten first may not be first digested, because it may be grosser and more viscid. Things boyled, Caeteris paribus, are sooner digested than rosted things, and such things as are not smoaked, sooner than such as are: Milk or Broath is digested in the Space of an Hour, and in a great measure distributed: Bread is pretty soon dissolved, so are Pot-herbs and Pulse; but Fish and Flesh require longer Time: That Meat which is dissolved, does not stay in the Stomach till all be so, but that which is first dissolved is first conveyed to the lower Orifice, and transmitted thro' Page 51it. That this is so, the opening of many Dogs after eating, makes appear, and we judge that it is so in Men; but seeing Chylification is so various it cannot be limited to a certain Time, for some Peoples Stomachs are so strong, that the Chyle is perfected in in three, four, or five Hours at most; whereas on the contrary, the Stomach of some is so weak, that eight, ten, or thirteen Hours are required to perfect Chylification: But generally speaking, seven Hours are sufficient: But the certain Sign of Chylification is the craving after more Meat. A further Chylification and Fermentation are made in the Guts; for first, the Chyle carries to the Guts from the Stomach, the digestive Humour well mixed with it, and new Spittle, and an acid Humour, continually slow to the Stomach, and so a new ferment of it is continually generated, and passes from the Stomach to the Chyle expelled; yea, it is probable, that some acid Humour continually flows from the Meseraick Arteries, as in the Stomach, upon all the Guts that are near it. Digestion is better made in the Night when we sleep than in the Day when we are awake, at least the Assumption being equal, and other things alike; for in Sleep, the Blood and Spirits, being not so much carried to the external Parts of the Body, the Stomach receives more Acid and Heat, and is the more nearly contracted, and so the better embraces the Meat; and consequently the Supper, which is contrary to Custom now adays, ought to be a fuller Meal than the Dinner; and tho' the Time betwixt Dinner and Supper, is less than betwixt the Supper and the next Days Dinner, yet you must know, that that which is eaten at a large Dinner, is often not fully digested before Supper, and so the Stomach has a double Task. Chylification is also better in Winter than in Summer, and therefore we are sooner hungry in Winter, Image 36 (page 52)we eat more, and grow fat; and this Reason confirms, because in Winter the Acid of the Stomach being less resolved, abounds more. Sanguification is the Conversion of Chyle into Blood; this is done in the whole Body, but especially in the Heart, and in the left Ventricle of it, wherein the Particles of Chyle are much rarified and agitated with the Particles of the Blood. The Cause of Sanguification is our Heat or natural Fire, which remaining after the foregoing Fermentation of the Blood in the Heart, insinuates it self presently into the Pores of the other Blood coming into the Heart, mixed with the Chyle, in the Passage whereof, when it meets with some Particles that disagree with it, Fermentation arises among the Particles of the Chyle, and with the Blood in the Heart and Arteries, whereby they are lessened by degrees, rendred flexible, and disposed to Redness. That Heat is the Cause of Redness, and consequently, the Author of Sanguification, none will deny, who sees Quinces, that before were white, Beer, and other things, to grow red by boyling, and that some chymical Liquors poured upon one another ferment and become red. But there are some, notwithstanding, will not have Sanguification to be made by any Fermentation in the Heart, denying that the Blood is so rarified and agitated in the Heart by a subtle Matter, for these Reasons; First, because in this case so great a Quantity of Blood would fall upon the Ventricles of the Heart, as would endanger the breaking of them. Secondly, Because the Blood does not stay a sufficient Time in the Heart for such a Rarefaction, and if it were put upon a Fire, it would not rarifie so soon. Thirdly, that the Heart being pricked, the Blood comes out frothy. To the first I answer, that so much Blood does not enter into the Ventricles, as to fill them with its Quantity; for the Auricles, which Page 53are as it were the Measures of the Ventricles, are not so great; besides, the fleshy Walls of them have their Expansibility, to which, when they are extended, the Heart is irritated, and presently contracts, and so there is no Danger of a Rupture. To the second I answer, that it ought not to continue long, because the Blood is in a manner previously endued with sufficient Heat, as we see Milk rarified, being removed from the Fire, subsides a little, and being put on again, presently rarifies more; and the reason why Blood does not rarifie so soon on the Fire as in the Heart, is because the subtle Matter, whereby it is very apt to rarifie, is lost, when the Blood is drawn out. To the third I answer, that this may be, because so soon as it comes out of the Heart, much of the subtle Matter flies away; and therefore, upon the whole, we suppose, that Sanguification is perfected in us by Fermentation. The peristaltick Motion of the Guts is a Motion whereby the Stomach and Guts are continually and successively straightened from the Beginning to the End, and creep amongst themselves like Worms. This is proved by our constantly seeing it in the Dissection of living Animals. Perhaps some will say, that this is a Convulsion and preternatural, but I think this ought not to be suspected, because it also appears in a Dog, a very small Apertion of the Belly being only made, which may be done by less Pain than will cause a Convulsion, especially if the Dog be young. Besides, those annular and carnous Fibres in the Tunicks of the Intestines, that have so many Nerves, shew the same; also the Protrusion of the Chyle and Faeces thro' the Guts, which would be otherwise very difficult, by reason of so many Turnings and Windings, and so be the Cause of Putrefaction, and slow Nutrition. Image 37 (page 54) This Motion is made by a successive Inflation, and Contraction of the annular Fibres, by the animal Spirits, and also by the Retraction of the right Fibres. Nutrition is the Conversion of the Aliment into the Substance of the living Body, whereby the living Body, according to all its integral Parts, keeps proportionably the same Quantity; and therefore the Restauration ought to be precisely as much, as the Diminution is. Nutrition is necessary to all Animals, not only in respect of the Augmentation of their Parts, while they are little Embryo's, but also in respect of their Conservation after, during Life; because their Bodies being in a natural Consumption, or Exhaustion, would inevitably be soon resolved into their first Elements, unless the Providence of Nature had ordained a continual Renovation or Reparation of Parts, by Substitution, and Assimulation of fresh Matter in the room of those Particles dispersed and consumed. The efficient Cause of the perpetual Consumption of our Bodies, seems to be what all Philosophers unanimously hold it to be, the vital Heat of the Blood, therein first kindled, by the plastick Spirit continually renewed by the vital Spirit, and by the Arteries diffused to all Parts of the Body, that they may thereby be warmed, cherished, and enlivened. This vital Heat continually glowing within us, and principally in the Ventricles of the Heart, consisting in a certain Motion of the various Particles of the Blood, and in some Degree, analogous to Fire or Flame, I cannot conceive how it is possible for it to subsist or continue, for so much as one Moment of Time, unless it be maintained by convenient Fuel, which is thereby uncessantly fed upon, and by degrees consumed, for it is of the Nature of all Fire, how gentle, or mild soever, to generate and conserve it self, only by preying upon, and destroying the Matter wherein it is generated. Page 55This vital Heat therefore, without Intermission, agitating, dissolving, and consuming the minute and most easily exsoluble Particles of the Body, must be the efficient Cause of the perpetual Consumption of our Bodies; so that in truth we have one and the same Cause both of our Life, and of our Death; and to speak more properly, our very Life is nothing but a continual Death, and we live because we die; for we live so long, as while this internal vestal Heat is kept glowing in the Blood, and when it ceases to glow, either for want of convenient Sustenance, or by violent Suffocation, the Life is instantly extinguished. The Matter consumed, I humbly conceive to be, for the greatest part, the fluid Parts of the Body, chiefly the Blood and Spirits which are most easily exsoluble, and somewhat, tho' but little of the Substance also of the solid Parts; for Experience teaches, that divers Animals, Bears, Dormice, Swallows, and the like, sleep the whole Winter, without receiving any Supply of Aliment, and yet have all the solid Parts of their Bodies as large and firm, when they awake again in the Spring, as when they first betook themselves to their Dens and Dormitories, and the reason hereof seems to be this, that their vital Heat being all that time calm and gentle, consumes their Blood and Spirits but slowly, and very little of their solid Parts, as a Lamp burns long, when the Oyl that seeds it is much, and the Flame but little and calm. We have Examples also of Leucophlegmatic Virgins; who, from a gradual Decay of Appetite, have fallen at length into an absolute Aversion from all Food, and endured long Abstinence without either Miracle or Imposture, and yet notwithstanding, have not been emaciated in Proportion to the Time of their fasting; whence it is probable, that in our Bodies there is not so rapid and profuse an Expence, or Exhaustion of the Substance of the solid Parts, as heretofore many learned Image 38 (page 56)Physicians have imagined to be made by the Activity of the vital Heat. It is difficult, if not impossible, to make an accurate Computation of the dayly Expences of this vital Heat; for so great is the Difference among Men, in respect of Temperament, Diet, Age, Exercise, the Season of the Year, and various other Circumstances, that a definite Calculation cannot be made of this Dispense, no not in those who keep to the strictest Rules of an ascetic Life, weighing themselves and their Meat and Drink, as Cornaro is repored to have done dayly. We may indeed conjecture, from the static Experiments of Sanctorius, that the Expence is great, for instance, if fourty Pounds of Meat and Drink be supposed sufficient to maintain a Man of middle Stature, sober and of good Health, for ten Days, and about twenty Pounds be assigned to the Excrements voided by Stool and Urine in that Time, the other twenty Pounds may be reasonably ascribed to insensible Transpiration; but still this is meer Conjecture. As to the Restauration, the efficient Principle is certainly the very same with the generant or formative; because Generation cannot be effected without Augmentation, and Augmentation is Nutrition: And I conceive, that Life consists in, and depends upon a continual Generation of the vital Spirits out of the most subtle, active, and volatile Parts of the Blood, and that Nutrition consists in Reparation of what is consumed by Apposition and Assimulation of consimular and congenerous Matter. The material or constituent Principle I take to be a certain mild, sweet, and balsamic Liquor, analogous to the White of an Egg, and they are mistaken, who think that the Parts of the Body, being in Substance diverse, the Parts of the Aliment also ought to be equally diverse, as if Nutrition were really nothing but Selection, and simular Attraction of convenient Aliment, and that there were not Page 57required in every single Part, a Concoction, Assimulation, Apposition, and Transmutation of one Matter common to all; for first, it is a difficult Question, whether there be in Nature any such thing as Attraction or not, and to prove simular Attraction is yet more difficult, so that the very Foundation of this Opinion is meerly precarious. Moreover, it is evident, that the Aliment common to all the Parts, is simular, not heterogeneous, it being the proper Work of the plastic Power still remaining in every Animal, as to form all the various Parts out of the same homogeneous Matter at first, so to augment and repair them all during Life, out of like Matter, by transforming that into the Substance of every Part, which is indeed potentially all Parts, but actually none, as out of the same Rain-Water all sorts of Plants receive their Nourishment. As to the manner how this homogeneous Matter is by the plastic Power accommodated to the Refection of all the various Parts of the Body; most probable it is, that this admirable Work is gradually done by Distribution, Apposition, Affixion, or Agglutination, and Assimulation, or Transmutation; all which Acts must be successively performed, before the Operation can be compleat; for the Succus nutritius being prepared first in the Stomach and Guts, and then in other Parts, to that end ordained, must be distributed, brought home, and apponed to all Parts, that need Refection; then from Contiguity by Apposition, it must be advanced to Continuity by Affiction or Agglutination, and in fine, made of the same Substance with each Part by Assimulation or Transmutation, which is the Perfection, or ultimate Term of Nutrition. Generation is a Production of Nature, whereby one living Creature is formed in the Similitude of another. Generation is performed in the following manner, the virile Seed is injected into the Sheath of the Womb, Image 39 (page 58)and from thence is elevated a certain seminal Air or Spirit, which flies thro' the inner Mouth of the Womb, to the Bottom of it, and thence to the Fallopian Tubes, and so to the Testicles or Ovaria of the Woman. Some think that the most spirituous Portion of the Seed is imbibed by the Substance of the Womb, and so conveyed with the Blood, to the Ovaria, to fecundate them: But our way is the easier and shorter, at the same time the Woman, by reason of Pleasure and Titulation, is wont to emit a certain serous Humour, which may conduce to Conception, tho' it be not Seed, by diluting and rarifying the virile Seed, and by rendring the Separation of the seminal Spirit more easie, and by elevating it to the Ovaria, and so the seminal Air being raised from the virile Seed, that which is gross remains in the Sheath, is dissipated and slides out; and that we are generated by this seminal Air, and not by gross Seed, may be proved by Superfoetation, or new Conception in those that are with Child; for in such the Mouth of the Womb is close shut, so that nothing but a Spirit can pass. Moreover, this may be proved by some that generate, tho by reason of the Brevity and Debility of the Penis, never cast their Seed into the Bottom of the Womb, which certainly cou'd not be, if the Air alone of it were not sufficient for Generation; and do we not see that a Cock generates without the Ejection of Seed, and meerly, as I may say, by touching the Fundament of the Hen with a moistened Penis, and yet this Place is far distant from the Ovaria in a Hen; what therefore can conduce to the breeding of Eggs, may consequentto the Generation of Men? This seminal Air therefore being conveyed from the Bottom of the Womb thro' the Fallopian Tubes, into the Ovaria, there insinuates it self into one Egg or more, as they are nearer to its Entrance, or more disposed to receive and nourish it; and hence it is, why all the Eggs are not fecundated Page 59at once, and ordinarily but a few; and why not always at the first Congress. The Eggs are best fecundated, when a Woman is nearest the Time of her Courses, by reason of the greater Porosity of her Womb and Testicles, whereby the seminal Air is the easier received into the Eggs. The Eggs are contained in membranous Cups like Acorns, and indeed very loosly, so that they may be expelled out of them by the Breath only. The fecundated Egg being turgid and rarified by the seminal Spirit, can no longer contain it self in its Cup, but falls from it of its own accord into the Fallopian Tube, and from thence, by a successive Constriction of all the Fibres, it is forced into the Bottom of the Womb.   CHAP. IX. Of things nonnatural in general. THings nonnatural are things necessary for the Preservation of Health, but hurt it when ill applyed; such are the ambient Air, Meat and Drink, Sleep and Watching, Motion and Rest, things to be evacuated and retained. These things indifferently do good or Hurt, as they are well or ill applyed: But we must understand, that what is good for one, may be hurtful for another, according to the Nature and Custom in divers People, whereunto much is to be attributed in the Use of nonnatural things; yea, the same thing may do good at one time, and hurt at another. We do not consider Air here simply and by it self, but as it encompasses us, that is, as it has various Corpuscles mixed with it, and as it can affect us with them: But it generally affects our Bodies, either extrinsically, that is, by insinuating it self into the Pores Image 40 (page 60)of the Skin, or intrinsically being breathed in; and either way variously, as it is by it self diverse, or by being mixed with other things, so if there is much Water mixed with it, it may moisten us much, and if it be very subtle, it may heat us much, and if it be mixed with narcotic things, as in some places it is, it may make us drowsy, yea, induce a deadly Sleep: If it be infected with a pestilential Contagion, or with any other ill thing, it may occasion the Plague, or some other Disease. It is disputed by some, whether Air or Aliment affects us most; but because the manner of both is diverse, it cannot be so exactly judged of, yet it is certain, we are much affected by both, and indeed more contitinually by the Air, than Aliment; for we can scarce continue a Moment without Air, for unless it attemperate the Heat of the Blood, it will be soon choaked; but we are more sensibly and vehemently affected with Aliment, by reason of the Grossness and Density of it. If you ask what Air is most proper for the Preservation of Health, I say, a pure and limpid Air, that is ventilated with wholesome Winds, and free from nasty Exhalations, from Carcases. and Sinks, and the like; and such an one I judge proper for any healthy Man: But when any Quality exceeds its contrary, it requires an Air that is excessive in the contrary, so a hot Air is proper for a Man that is very cold, and cold Air for one that is very hot, and for Diversity of Ages, Diversity of Air is proper, for with them the Temperament is changed, and therefore with the virile Age, which is most temperate and perfect, a temperate Air best agrees. To the Air are to be reduced Winds, Regions, and Stats, for by these the State of the Air is much changed. The Wind is nothing else than the Air, togegether with Exhalations and Vapours adhering to it, agitated about the Earth, the Wind is useful in moving Page 61the Air about, and thereby preserving it from Putrefaction, and it dissipates Filth that is mixed with the Air. Sailers reckon twenty four Winds, some twelve, others 16; but the chief of them are those four which are called Cardinal, namely, the North, which is cold and dry, the South, which is hot and moist, the East, which is hot and dry, the West, which is cold and moist. The South Wind is the most unwholesome, because it occasions a Dullness of the Senses, and burthens all the Actions and Parts. The North is also bad, next to that the West, but the best of all is the East, especially breathing in a Morning, for then it is purer, because it breaths from a Place where the Sun is. The West is also good, if it blow in the Evening. A Region is a Part of Earth, where there is a great Difference in the first Qualities, by reason of a more right or oblique Motion of the Sun-beams. Regions are chiefly five, viz. the Aequinoctial placed under the Zodiack, the North lying in a Space betwixt the Circle of Cancer and the Arctick Pole, the Meridian in the Space betwixt Capricorn and the Antarctick Pole, the Oriental and the Occidental.   CHAP. X. Of Meat and Drink. MEat is a solid and gross Aliment, that chiefly takes off Hunger; it is said chiefly, because the thinner Part of it may quench Thirst, as thick Drink may appease Hunger. How great the Necessity of both is, and how easily we are hurt by them, every one knows. Image 41 (page 62) All Aliment is either taken from Plants or Animals, but that nourishes less than this, because this has a Matter more agreeable to ours; namely, of almost the same Aliment and Chyle, and more agreeable to our Parts and Pores; and therefore easier adheres to them. Minerals do not nourish, because they have Parts too much disagreeable to ours, and cannot adhere to them, by reason of their Rigidity; but indeed, Chymists say, that aurum potabile protracts Life; but if this be true, it does it upon another account, and not by nonrishing; namely, by strengthening the Blood, and discussing its superfluous Humidity, and by raising the languid Heat in old Men. Some Meat is of good Juice, that is, nourishes much; some of ill Juice; some is easily digested, some more difficultly; and some is easily corrupted in the Stomach, other not, and of those which are easily digested, and of those which are not easily digested, some are of good Juice, some not: All Meat that soon dissolves, soon nourishes; but all of it does not nourish much, because it may be of an improper Juice; for such things as nourish much, ought to participate of Grosness and Viscosity, which, Caeteris paribus, are slower dissolved. Meat of the best Juice, of easie Digestion, and of the fewest Excrements, is best, and the contrary worst. Bread is made of various Corn, but the best of good Wheat well fermented before, whereof the finest is called White-bread, made of the finest Meal, the purest, softest, and lightest, and freed from all the Bran, and this is most nourishing. The next Degree is not free from all the Bran, but only from the grosser. Houshold Bread has all the Bran and Flower mixed together confusedly. There is also a sort of Bread that is courser, which consists more of Bran than of Flower, and this nourishes laest. Among all these Kinds, Page 63the Houshold-bread is the most wholesome; because, by reason of the Bran joined with it, it does not obstruct so much, and loosens the Belly, and moderately nourishes; but the finest, and the next Sort, cause Obstructions by their Viscidity, the coursest nourishes least, but more or less, according to the Bran: This is most used by poor People, and so is Rye-bread, which is harder, black, and offends the Stomach. Of the Flesh of four-footed Beasts, Veal is the best, next to that Mutton and Kid; of Fowl, Chicken, Capons, Pidgeons, Patridges; of Sea Fish, Cod-fish; of River Fish, a Pearch, a Gudgeon, a Pike. Of those things that come from Animals, Eggs and Milk are the best; of Fruits, Raisins and Figs: But these that are said to be the best and most healthful, are not good for every body, nor does any agree with every body; but every one must find out what best agrees with him: For those that have a good Stomach, or labour much, as Country-men, Soldiers, and Sailers, Beef and Pork is best, because they want a solid and gross Blood, which nourishes much, and does not so soon wast. Fish are suspected by many, but undeservedly; for they make good Blood of a moderate Consistence, and are easily digested. The manner in eating ought to be such, that the gross ought to be eat first; for though I suppose that there is a Confusion of all things taken into the Stomach, and that the Order of Assumption does not continue long, yet the grosser being taken first, may be sooner worked upon by the Acid of the Stomach. We ought to eat when we are hungry, and when the Stomach is empty; but some are hungry when their Stomachs are full, by reason of too great Quantity of the Acid, and in this Case the Hunger must not be taken off by Meats, because it is not natural. I cannot say in general how often we ought to eat in a Day, for such as are cholerick may eat three or Image 42 (page 64)four times a Day moderately; such as are phlegmatic may eat once a Day, because they bear Hunger better, and do not consume so much Blood. Such as are melancholy may eat twice or thrice a Day. We ought to eat so much at a time as will take off Hunger without burthening the Stomach, or so much as the Stomach can concoct without leaving Crudities behind it; the Quantity of the Meat is to be varied according to the Constitution, Strength, and Age; so one Quantity is proper for Youth, another for Age, another for a weak Man, another for a strong Man, another for a healthy Man, another for a sick Man, another for a cholerick Man, another for a flegmatic Man, and such a Quantity for one that exercises his Body, and less for one that exercises his Mind: But it is better to eat somewhat too much than too little; and therefore it is better to indulge the Appetite somewhat, for so the Stomach will be accustomed to bear sometimes small Excesses, and to concoct something more. And as the Quantity of Meats ought to be adapted to the Constitutions, so the Quality ought to be so too, according to the Diversity of Tempers, Age, Time, and Custom; so those that are hot and dry ought to use cooling and moistening Diet, so Children require more tender Diet than Youths or Men, and a cooler Diet ought to be used in Summer than in Winter. Meats boyled sooner turn to Chyle than rosted Meat; but rosted Meat nourishes more, because it more abounds with nutritive Juice, as may be seen by cutting it with a Knife; for the hard Crust without keeps in the Gravey, which is dispersed in the Broath of boyled Meat; therefore rosted Meat is most proper for Labourers, and boyled Meat for those that live a sedentary Life. Drink is a thin and liquid Aliment, chiefly used to quench Thirst. The chiefest kind of Drinks are Water, Wine, and Beer. It is disputed concerning Water, Page 65whether it nourishes; but I say it nourishes; for it is not a simple Element, and many Men live pretty well that drink only Water, and seem to be refreshed by it; and we see that Water alone nourishes a long while, and that Fish increase, being kept in Troughs; and so Plants and Fruits are nourished by Water. There are many Species of Water, there is Rain-water, Well-water, Fountain-water, Lake-water, Snow-water, and Ice-water. The best Water is that which is limpid and Sweet, or rather without any Taste or Colour, so that the Goodness of Water is to be judged of by the Absence of Colour, Taste, and Smell. Some think that the lightest Water is best, but this is not to be judged of by the Scale; for often ill Water weighs less than good; but the meaning is, it sits lighter upon the Stomach and Bowels. Fountain-water is the best, if it be strained thro' good Earth; next to it Rain-water, which is lighter, thinner, and clearer, but is worse, by reason of diverse Vapours and Exhalations, which are mixed with it. Well-water is very unwholesome, because it is counted to stagnate, and is not agitated by the Rayes of the Sun, and if the Well be covered, it is much worse That which is taken out of the midst of a River is better, if it be clear, and if the Stream be rapid. The Water of a Lake is very ill, by reason of the Stagnation. Worst of all is Ice or Snow-Water; for it is very impure and crude. In short, the best is the pure, clear, and subtle Water; which being set on the Fire, soon heats, and taken thence, is soon cool. Let the Fountain be situate towards the East, and run to the North. The Water which runs on pure Earth is better than such as runs upon Stones. It is good for hot, fat, and fleshy Men, and mixed with Wine for such as use much Labour and Exercise: And tho' it does not nourish much, yet it refreshes, and is a Vehicle for the Food; it excites Appetite, and Image 43 (page 66)opportunely given in burning Fevers, it does good; for it is very contrary to the Nature of a Fever, for it refreshes and moistens the Body; but it is bad for such as have weak Stomachs, and that are troubled with Convulsions. Ill Water is corrected by beaten Pepper, or with Anise-seeds, and for sick Men boyl therewith Cinnamon, and the like. Honey-Water or Metheglin has great Vertues, it takes away Thirst, cures cold Infirmities of the Brain, Nerves, and Joints. It is good against Coughs, cuts and expells gross Flegm, moves the Body, and purges the Passages of the Urine. Wine is expressed from the Grape. There are various Differences of it according to the Colour, Smell, Grossness, Tenuity, and Age. Wine is hot and dry; the best Wine is that which tastes rough, and sweetish. Sweet Wine nourishes much, is a Friend to the Breast, but soon increases Choler: Rough Wine, on the contrary, is injurious to the Breast, and binds much: Fragrant Wine refreshes the Spirits much, but afterwards it disorders the Head. Yellow Wine is hotter than white; it is aperitive, and forces Urine. Red Wine strengthens the Stomach, and other Parts, and makes laudable Blood; but if it be gross, it breeds gross Blood, nourishes more, and causes Obstructions. That which is thin is more aperitive than that which is gross, it sooner passes, and does not nourish so much. New Wine is not so hot as old, but generates Wind, unless it loosen the Belly. Old Wine disturbs the Head: Rhenish Wine, by reason of its great Tenuity and Crudity, stirs up the Humours into a Flux, and separates them from the Mass, and occasions the Gout. Of all the Liquors we drink, Wine may justly claim the Superiority; for it is more wholesome, and by reason of its subtle and penetrating Substance, it mixes better with the Mass than Water and other Drinks: Besides, it is very pleasant and grateful to the Pallate, it restores the radical Moisture, and chears the Heart, and is Page 67the most certain Prop and Maintainance of our Life; and therefore our Fore-fathers called the Vine Vitis, quasi vita, as if it were the Tree of Life: But the Use thereof is to be regulated by these 12 following Instructions; 1st. When the Wine is strong and full of Spirit, we must always mix Water therewith; 2dly. Never drink Wine after Dinner nor Supper, till the Concoction of the Food be ended; for then it helps Nourishment, penetrating more easily the Body; whereas at first it will hinder Digestion. 3dly. You must have a care that you do not drink Wine cooled with Snow or Ice-Water, for it is very pernicious to the Brain, Sinews, Breast, Stomach, Kidneys, and Bladder. 4thly. You must avoid drinking Wine fasting, because it troubles the Understanding, occasions the Cramp, and is exceeding hurtful to the Brain and Nerves. 5thly. It is not convenient to drink a large Quantity of thin Wine after moist Fruit. 6thly. If at the same Table both strong and small Wine are used, begin with the small, reserving the strong for the last, which comforts the Mouth of the Stomach, and helps Digestion. 7thly. By how much the Food is more cold and gross, by so much the more need is there of strong Wine: But when the Food is more subtle, hot, and digestable, let the Wine be weak; and therefore such as feed on Beef and Fish are to drink stronger Wine than such as feed on Pullets, and the like. 8thly. Such as use much Wine, ought not to eat much, for Wine serves instead of Meat and Drink; and therefore Nature cannot easily digest them both. 9thly. Wine that is weaken'd with Water is wholesomer than that which is naturally weak; for the later more easily putrifies. 10thly. Such as have a weak Brain and hot Stomach, and dwell in sultry Countries, ought to drink a little Wine, mixing Water therewith: But if cold, more Wine and less Water will not be amiss. 11thly. You must observe the Season Image 44 (page 68)of the Year, for in Winter drink very sparingly, but strong Wine; in Summer more largely, but small and mixed with Water. 12thly. You must consider the Age, for as Wine is very bad for Children, so it is most proper for old Men, seeing that it qualifies and allays their cold Complexion; and therefore Plato denies Wine to Children, gives young Men leave to drink it moderately, and allows old Men a more plentiful Use thereof, saying, that young Men, before they are twenty two Years old ought not to drink any Wine, because that will add Fire to their Fire. Good Wine ought to be clean, pure, and clear; it must be of an excellent Odour, for such Wines increase the subtle Spirits, nourish excellently, and breed good Blood; it must taste pleasantly, but most not be sharp nor sweet; for if sweet, it inflames, obstructs, and fills the Head; if sharp or sowre, it hurts the Nerves and Stomach, and begets Crudities. Wine, if used discreetly and moderately, does communicate innumerable Benefits, both to Body and Mind; for as to the Mind, it is rendered more secure and calm, the Spirits are strengthened, and dilate themselves, Joy and Gladness are augmented, sad and unpleasant Thoughts are banished; it clears the Understanding, excites the Wit, takes away Melancholy, incourages the Spirits, and enlivens them; it is very nourishing, resists Putrefaction, helps Digestion, and breeds good Blood, cuts Flegm, expels Wind, provokes Sleep, excites Appetite, fattens healthy Men, opens Obstructions, concocts crude Humours, and is the Theriaca magna of the Ancients. New Wine is of difficult Digestion, offends the Bowels, causes Wind and the Bloody Flux. Old Wine is hot and dry, and the older it is, the more Heat it acquires. The best is odoriferous and full of Spirits: It is naught for Copulation, because it dries up the Seed. It is naught for young Men and Page 69cholerick Persons; but good for old Men, especially in the Winter. Beer and Ale are common and familiar Drinks in England, and no doubt it is profitable and wholesome, as Experience shews: But the different Preparations, or Brewing thereof, make no small Difference in the Drink. The Difference of Waters also, whereof it is made, is greatly to be considered; therefore, according to their Natures, you must judge of the Drink; also the Difference of the Corn or Grain is to be considered; as Drinks made of Wheat-malt nourish most. Some People mix Wheat and Barly together: Others mix some Oats with Barly for Malt: Generally in Ale are used no Hops, or less Hops than in Beer; therefore Ale is more nourishing, and loosens the Belly. Cider is a cold Liquor, it is very pleasant indeed, but is windy; it is said to be good for the Scurvy. Because Meat and Drink are of so great Importance with respect to the Preservation of Health, and Cure of Diseases, as well as for Sustenance, I shall here particularly, tho briefly, discourse of the various Sorts of Meats, Fruits, and Herbs, which are generally used for Diet. Beans Cleanse and fatten, but are windy, therefore occasion Cholick Pains, and disturb the Head. The French is the best and least windy. Pease are not so windy as Beans, Green Pease are very pleasant to the Tast, provoke Appetite, are good for Coughs and an Asthma; but they are injurious to many, by reason of their Windiness. Rice binds the Body, cures Fluxes, Pains in the Stomach, and Griping in the Guts, but being used too long, causes Obstructions and Wind. Asparagus is quickly boyled, nourishes more than all other Herbs, is good for the Stomach, purges the Breast, provokes Urine, and cleanses the Kidneys from Gravel. Image 45 (page 70) Capers excite Appetite, remove Obstructions of the Liver and Spleen, kill Worms, and are good for phlegmatic and melancholy People. Artichokes are pleasant to the Taste, provoke Urine, and make it stink, as Asparagus does; but they are windy, and injure the Head and Stomach. Cabbage loosens the Belly, is good for Stoppage of Urine and other Obstructions: but it is windy, and causes a stinking Breath, and increases Melancholy. Sampier beink pickled, preserves the Stomach, and is good for the Reins. Lettice is easily digested, breeds Milk, and provokes Sleep. Parsly provokes Urine, the Courses, cleanses the Reins, and removes Obstructions and Wind, but is bad for the Head and Eye-sight. Garlick is good against Poison, the Worms, provokes Urine, and is good for a Dropsie and Shortness of Breath; but is injurious to the Head and Eyesight. Carrots breed Milk, provoke the Courses and Urine, and open Obstructions; but they are windy. Onions increase Appetite, attenuate the Humours, make a good Colour, and increase Seed; but they are bad for the Head and Eyes. Parsnips provoke the Courses and Urine, and remove Obstructions; but they are windy, provoke Venery, occasion the Itch, and breed bad Blood. Leeks provoke Urine and the Courses, and expel Wind, they are good for the Lungs and Stomach, but they offend the Head. Radishes provoke Urine, expel Gravel, and increase Milk; but they cause stinking Belshes and Wind. Quinces help Digestion, stop Fluxes and vomiting, and strengthen the Stomach. Apples comfort the Heart, open the Breast, and are pectoral. Page 71 Pears provoke Appetite, and strengthen the Stomach, and loosen the Belly: But Bergamots are the most wholesome, but being eaten before Meals they breed Wind and occasion the Cholick. Oranges that are sweet, eaten before Meals, are good for the Stomach. Sowre Oranges quench the Thirst, and excite Appetite; but sowre, or Sevil Oranges bind the Body, cool the Stomach, and contract the Breast, and the sweet increase Choler. Lemons excite Appetite, stop vomiting, cut gross Humours, are good in malignant Fevers, and kill Worms. An Ounce of the Juice drank in Wine expells Gravel: But they cool the Stomach, occasion the Cholick, and cause Leanness, and breed melancholy Humours. Filberts eaten at the Beginning of Dinner are good against Gravel; but they are hardly digested, cause Wind, and Pains in the Head. Walnuts fasten loose Teeth, they preserve against Poison and the Plague; but they must be eaten at Break-fast, and are good after Fish; they kill Worms, and being preserved, they loosen the Belly, and are pectoral: But they hurt the Throat, cause Coughs, when they are dry, and cause the Head-ach. The Shade of a Nut-Tree is very injurious; for it sends out ill Vapours that offend the Head. Apricocks quench Thirst, excite Appetite, and provoke Urine; the Kernels kill Worms, and are excellent for the Heart-burning; but they cause Fluxes of the Belly, and putrifie quickly, and breed gross and viscous Flegm. Peaches are good for the Stomach, and loosen the Belly. The best are those that are odoriferous, wellcoloured, and fully ripe, so that they come clear from the Stone; they must be eaten before Dinner, and good Wine must be drank after them; but they soon corrupt, occasion Wind and ill Humours. Image 46 (page 72) Olives cleanse the Stomach from Flegm, and excite Appetite, and stop vomiting, the Pickle is good to wash the Mouth; for it fastens loose Teeth, and strengthens the Gums. Plums purge Choler, extinguish Heat, take away Thirst in severish People, but they injure a cold and weak Stomach, are bad for flegmatick Persons, and such as are troubled with the Cholick. Cucumbers are very cooling and refreshing in the Summer, they provoke Urine, and are good for the Reins and Bladder, and a hot Stomach; but they are apt to corrupt, and to breed ill Humours, if they are not quickly concocted by the Stomach. Strawberries extinguish Heat, take away Thirst, provoke Urine and the Appetite: But they soon corrupt in the Stomach, and are very injurious to paralytic People, to such as are troubled with Convulsions, and those that eat many of them are often seized with malignant Fevers. Melons are very refreshing, they cleanse the Body, provoke Urine, quench Thirst, and excite Appetite, and are excellent for the Gravel and Stone: But they occasion Wind and Gripes, and being corrupted, malignant Fevers. Flesh is more nourishing than all other Food, for it is easily turned into Blood, and affords great Nourishment. You must always take notice, that Flesh, Herbs, Fruits and Corn are to be chosen in high Places, such as are refreshed with wholesome Winds, and recreated with the warm Beams of the Sun, where there are no Ponds, Lakes, and standing Waters; for in such Places they are quickly corrupted. The Flesh of all those Creatures which live in Fens and standing Pools are to be avoided, as Ducks and Geese. The Flesh of Creatures too old are naught, hard, dry, sinewy, and of small Nourishment, and hard to be digested; and on the contrary, such as are too young Page 73overabound with Moisture, and are full of Superfluities, tho' easily concocted in the Stomach. Salted Flesh occasions gross and melancholy Humours, and bad Juice; for it dries much, and nourishes little. Fat Meat is easily digested, but breeds many Superfluities, and therefore is of small Nourishment; it takes away the Appetite, and hinders Digestion. The leaner nourishes better, and generates fewer Superfluities; and therefore the midling betwixt both is most wholesome. The Flesh of Birds is lighter, dryer, and easier digested than that of four-footed Beasts, and therefore more agreeable to those that exercise the Mind more than the Body, for they are digested more easily, and breed Blood that is clear, clean, and full of Spirits, and fit for the Exercise of the Mind. The Flesh of wild Creatures, and such as frequent the Woods is better than that of tame, and the Blood which is bred by eating them, will have fewer Superfluities, by reason of much running and Exercise, which they are accustomed to; and because they live in a more dry Air, especially such as frequent the Mountains, and their Flesh will keep longer uncorrupted; for they have less Fat; and therefore generate fewer Superfluities, nourish better, and breed a more sound Blood; but tame Creatures are more moist than wild, by reason of their little Motion, and the Moistness of the Air they live in. In moist Times and Complexions, the Flesh that inclines to Dryness is most proper; and so on the contrary. The Flesh of gelded Creatures is best, because it is most temperate; for it is more hot than the Female, and colder than the Male. The Flesh of black Creatures is lighter and sweeter than that of white. Image 47 (page 74) The Flesh that sticks to the Bone is of best Nourishment; and Flesh of the right Side is better than that of the left, and the fore Part is to be preferred to the hinder; because the fore Part is hotter and of easier Digestion, but the hinder Part is more cold and more gross; the Flesh near the Heart is better than that which is farther off; for being strengthened by the Heat of the Heart, it is more fit to nourish. That Flesh which is dry must be boyled, the moist roasted. The Flesh which is roasted is fatter, of greater Nourishment, tho' more hard of Digestion than boyled, which tho' of less, yet is of better Nourishment; and therefore more wholesome. At Dinner boyled Meats are best, at Supper roasted. Fryed and broyled Meats generate nauseous Humours and Crudities in the Stomach, and are of difficult Digestion, tho very nourishing. Lamb breeds good Nourishment, is easie to be digested, and is good against melancholy Humours, and is proper in hot weather and in hot Countries. Beef affords great Nourishment to those that labour much, and breeds much Blood. Veal nourishes much, and generates good Blood, and is easily digested. Kid is an excellent Nourishment, and very easie to be digested. Deer are of great and good Nourishment, and are good against the Palsie and Cholick, and make such lean as are too fat. Mutton breeds good Blood, makes good Nourishment, and is easily digested. Brawn made of the Flesh of tame young Bores is a delicate Meat, having not so much excrementitious Moisture, as Bacon or Pork, but the hard or horny Part is difficultly concocted. Page 75 Rabits are a good Nourishment, they consume the superfluous Moisture, and Flegm in the Stomach. The Flesh is whiter, and not so dry as that of a Hare; and therefore nourishes better, and is easier digested. Young Hares are very sweet and pleasant to the Stomach, they are good for such as are too fat, and cause a good Colour and Beauty in the Face. The Blood of a Hare fryed and eaten is good against the Bloodyflux, inward Imposthumes, and the Gravel in the Kidneys. The Brains of a roasted Hare cures the trembling of the Members, and facilitates the Breeding of Teeth in Children. Bacon and Pork yield a good Nourishment, but is injurious to such as live easie; they cause the Gout, especially the Flesh of a sucking Pig, and it causes the Cholick, and the Stone in the Kidneys. Amongst the Parts of Birds and Beasts, some are better than others; for all the Extremities, as the Head, the Neck, the Feet, the Tail, in respect of the rest, are hard, of little and gross Nourishment, and hard to be digested: But better and more savory are the Parts about the Wings, Back, and Breast. Butter is good for the Lungs, and nourishes well. Cheese that is new, fattens, tastes pleasantly, and is not injurious to the Stomach. Cream Cheese is most wholesome; but it must be eaten the same Day it is made in. Cheese is only to be eaten to shut up and close the Mouth of the Stomach, and we must beware we eat not too much of it, especially of old Cheese; for it occasions Thirst, inflames the Blood, and causes the Stone. Milk is good for the hectic Fever, takes off the Heat of Urine, cures Coughs, and opens the Breast, but it is naught for those that are troubled with the Cholick, and the Stone. Whey is good for such as are of a hot Constitution, it quenches Thirst, and provokes Sleep. Image 48 (page 76) The different Nature of Birds is discerned by the Time, the Age, the Food, the Place, and the Air; because at such Time as Birds couple, as well domestick as wild Fowl, they thereby grow lean, and feed little. Some Birds are best in the Summer, at which time they eat Corn; others in Autumn, because they eat Grapes, Figs, Apples, Berries, and the like. Other Birds are best in the Winter, as Thrushes, Blackbirds, wild Geese, Cranes, and all water Fowl. Some live on VVorms; but most eat Corn, as Pidgeons, Doves, and the like: In short, some are nourished on Land, others in Rivers, some in Lakes, and others in Sea, and a great many Birds feed on Herbs; and it is observable, that the Flesh of wild Fowl has always the Taste of such things as the Birds feed on, as of Ants, VVorms, Fish, Slime, and Mud. Mountain Fowl are always to be preferred before the rest; besides gelding or cutting a Fowl makes it fat and sweet, as appears in the Flesh of Capons. The Flesh of young Birds is always better than that of old. A Duck is the hottest of all tame Fowl; the VVings and Liver are the best; but of hard Digestion and gross Nourishment; but is good in cold weather for hot Stomachs, and such as labour much. Capon nourishes better than all other Fowl, and generates good Blood. Pidgeons afford good Nourishment, breed excellent Blood, and are good for old and flegmatic Men. They strengthen the Legs, and cure the Palsy; but they are not good for hot Constitutions. Pheasants are very agreeable to humane Nature, comfort and strengthen the Stomach, yield great Nourishment, and fatten exceedingly. Hens nourish the Body wonderfully, are easily digested, and breed good Blood: But old Hens are of hard Digestion. The Flesh of a Cock is dryer, hot, and sulphureous. Page 77 Turky is a good Nourishment, the Flesh is whitest and best, and excells all others in VVholesomness; for it is easily digested, and breeds good Blood. I arks, if they are fat, nourish well, and are easily digested, they are best in Autumn, and in VVinter. Blackbirds nourish sufficiently, when they are fat and young; but they are of hard Digestion. Geese; the best Parts of them are the VVings and Liver; the Flesh of young Geese affordeth good Nourishment, and fattens those that are lean. If you feed Geese with Milk, their Liver is much more pleasant, and digests and nourishes well enough; but their Flesh is of hard Digestion. Plovers are an excellent and wholesome Food, and afford good Nourishment; only they are of a melancholy Juice. Eggs of a fat Hen fed with Corn, and trod by the Cock, and fresh laid, are the best; next to these is a Pheasants Egg; but those of a Goose or Duck are naught, because they have a strong Smell, and are of hard Digestion; and therefore a young Hens Egg is beyond all. Let it be small, long, and fresh. Eggs are of a copious Nourishment, they are good for old Men, excite Venery, and open the Breast. Potched are best. Young Sparrows afford good Nourishment, excite Venery. Mountain Sparrows have a wonderful Vertue against the Stone in the Kidneys and Bladder; but are of difficult Digestion, and cause Melancholy. Peacocks; the best are bred in good Air, young and tender, they nourish enough, but are of hard and slow Digestion, and breed melancholy Blood. Partridges breed good and slender Nourishment, and easily digest, they fatten and dry up the Moisture of the Stomach, and contribute much to the Preservation of the Health, and the Flesh is better than that of a Hen. It is said, they cure the Pox and the Falling Image 49 (page 78)Sickness, being eaten a whole Year together; but old Partridges are of a very hard Substance, and of a very bad Taste, and injure Melancholy People, and bind the Body. Stares nourish well, and as they say, cure the Pox, continuing to eat every Day throughout the Year, one Stare and no more. But old Stares are of hard Digestion. Quails are good for melancholy Men, are very nourishing and pleasaing to the Taste: But some say, they cause Fevers, the Cramp, and Falling Sickness, wherewith they say this Bird is troubled. Thrushes nourish very well, and are easily digested, the Mountain Thrushes are the best. Turtles nourish excellently, and are easily digested; they strengthen the Stomach, and quicken the VVit; roasted with Cloves and Juice of Oranges are very good in the Bloody Flux, and for all other Fluxes. Fish, in respect of Flesh, are of less Nourishment, are gross, flegmatic, cold, and full of Superfluities. The old nourish more than the young, and those that live amongst Stones and Rocks are the best. Fish are of hard Digestion, and the sign of their Indigestion is Thirst; seeing they all cause Thirst if they remain long in the Stomach; nay, sometimes they corrupt. Concerning Fish, you may observe these following Rules: 1st. That all Fish should be eaten hot. 2dly. You must eat less of Fish than of Flesh. 3dly. You must not eat them too often. 4thly. You must not eat Fish after great Labour and Exercise; for then they easily corrupt; nor must they be eaten after other other Food. 5thly. Fish and Milk are not proper together, nor are Eggs to be used with it. 6thly. Great and slimy Fish pickled are better than fresh. 7thly. You must observe, that the clearer and deeper the VVater is, the better are the Fish that are nourished therein. 8thly. Sea Fish are wholesomer than freshwater Page 79Fish, hotter, and not so moist, and their Nourishment comes near that of Flesh. 9thly. Amongst the Sea and River Fish, those are best which live in rocky Places, next to these in sandy Places, in sweet, clear, and running VVater, where there is no Filth: But those Fish are naught which live in Pools, Lakes, Marshes, and in any still and muddy Water. 10thly. Amongst all the Fish both in Sea and Rivers, those which are not too big are the best, and which have not a hard and dry Flesh, that taste and smell well, are crisp and tender, and have many Fins and Scales. 11thly. Fish are cold and moist; and therefore naught for cold Constitutions, but good for cholerick Men. 12thly. The best way of dressing Fish is to broyl it, to boyl it is the next way, to fry it is the worst. Eels are of a delicate Taste and good Nourishment, but offend the Stomach, and are of hard Digestion, and being used too often, breed the Stone in the Kidnies and Bladder, and occasion the Gout and Convulsions. In short, whoever eats much of them indangers his Life. Carps are the most noble of all Fish, and of a very pleasant and grateful Taste, and nourish well, in what manner soever they are eaten. Crabs are good for consumptive People, they nourish very much, provoke Urine, and cleanse the Kidneys; but they are of hard Digestion. Lampreys are of excellent Nourishment, excite Venery, and are of a most delicious Taste; but they are of hard Digestion, bad for gouty People, and for such as are troubled with Convulsions. Pikes nourish very much; but are of hard Digestion. Oysters provoke Appetite, and they are a very proper Diet in many Cases. Sturgeon nourishes well, and excites Venery; but is of hard Digestion. Of the Spawn or Row of this Fish Salted Image 50 (page 80)is made Cavyare, which provokes Appetite, and makes the Drink relish. Lobsters fatten and nourish much, and their Broth cures Shortness of Breath; but they are cold and flegmatic, and of a hard Digestion. Sprats being boyled as soon as they are taken, yield good Nourishment and taste pleasantly; but they occasion VVind. Tench are very nourishing, but of hard Digestion. Salmon is pleasant to the Palate, easily digested, and affords good Juice. Soles, Plaice, and Turbet are highly commended amongst Sea Fish; for they have a delicate Flesh, they yield good Nourishment, are not easily corrupted, and are easily digested. Gudgeons are the best of all small Fish, wholesome Aliment, easily digested, and may be safely given to sick Persons. Pearch have soft, moist, and tender Flesh, but they nourish little, and are full of excrementitious Juice. Cod-fish, if fresh, is of good Juice, and easily concocted; but when it is dry, it is of hard Digestion, and of gross Nourishment. Barbels: The little ones are better than the great, and such as are caught in stony Places, and not in muddy Ponds; they are very pleasant to the Palate; but their Flesh is hard and not easily digested. Trouts: The biggest are best, and such as are bred in sweet VVaters. The River Trout nourishes well, good for young and cholerick, but naught for decrepid and flegmatick Men. Vinegar: The best is that which is made of the best VVine. It is cutting, digestive, and openining. It is very good to extinguish the Heat of Choler and Thirst. It strengthens the Gums, excites the Appetite, removes Obstructions, helps Digestion, and is good for Page 81hot and moist Stomachs, and resists Putrefaction; therefore is good in the Plague time: But it breeds melancholy Humours, injures the Nerves, makes lean, offends the Breast, and being used too much, makes Men look old and withered. Honey is abstersive and opening, provokes Urine, and cleanses its Passages. It is good for old and flegmatick Men of a cold Constitution, and is pectoral. Democritus being asked how a Man might keep himself in Health; Answered, by Oyl without, and Honey within. It heats the Stomach, moves the Body, resists Corruption, and turns to good Blood; but it occasions VVind and the Gripes. Oyl of Olives is very sweet, and agreeable to Nature. VVhen it is two Years old it is best, it ought to be made of ripe Olives. Oyl of sweet Almonds is next to it in Goodness. Oyl fattens, and a good Quantity of it is excellent to bring up Poyson by Vomit; but if it be eaten too often, it lessens the Appetite. Salt, of all Sawces, is best; without which no Food is good. It is put into Victuals for three Reasons: 1st. That thereby the Food may descend easier into the Stomach. 2dly. To make it more savoury. 3dly. Because it resists Putrefaction; consuming, by its Dryness, that Moisture, whereby Putrefaction might have been occasioned. It excites the Appetite, and digestive Faculty, and prevents nauseating. It dissolves, attenuates, and dries up the superfluous Moisture, provokes the Bowels to evacuate the Excrements, and is therefore used in Glisters and Suppositories; but things too much salted generate Melancholy and Vapours, breed ill Nourishment, dry up the Blood, cause Scabbiness and Itch, Ring-worms, and other such Humours and Breakings out in the Face and Body, and stops the Passages of the Urine.   Image 51 (page 82) CHAP. XI. Of Sleep and Watching. SLeep is the Cessation of the external Senses from Operation; the Cause of Sleep is the Remission and Subsidence of the Fibres, wherewith the Brain is chiefly formed, so that the Motions imprinted upon the Organs of the five external Senses cannot be duly propagated to the Seat of the Soul, and be known there, as we see that a Motion upon a slack String of a Violin is not so readily promoted, as when it is wond up hard. The said Remission of the Fibres in the Brain arises from a Defect or Dullness, so that the animal Spirits do not sufficiently expand those Tubes; and so after Labour we are inclined to Sleep, by reason of a Defect of the Spirits. In like manner, after the taking of Opium or other Narcoticks, we are disposed to sleep, because they seize the Spirits by their volatile Oleosity. Lastly, we are inclined to sleep after eating or drinking; because then the Humidity of the Brain relaxes the Fibres, and perhaps, because the Vapours somewhat hinder the Spirits: But some, when they drink much, cannot sleep; because the Spirits are thereby heated and inraged. All Creatures, by long Fatigues and VVatchings, waste and consume themselves; and therefore stand in need of Rest and Sleep, the Advantage and Good whereof is, that it reheats and corroborates the Members, concocts the Humours, augments the natural Heat, fattens the Body, heals the Infirmities of the Mind, and mitigates and allays Troubles and Sorrows: For whilst we sleep, the Faculties of the Mind repose themselves. Sleep also facilitates the Digestion of the Food which lies in the Stomach, and not only Page 83concocts it there, but also distributes it thro' the Parts of the Body; for the natural Heat concenters in the inward Parts, whereby the Food is better concocted. Lastly, Sleep removes all Lassitude and VVeariness, caused by overmuch watching; and therefore it is called a Rest from all Labour. But we must avoid long and superfluous Sleep, which is no less pernicious than the other is good; for it chills the Body, weakens the natural Heat, and breeds flegmatic Humours, whence afterwards proceeds much Sloath and Laziness, and sends many Vapours to the Head, which are oftentimes the immediate Cause of Rheums and Catarrhs, and is very destructive to gross and fat Bodies. In brief, it is neither good for the Body nor the Mind, nor for Business. He who sleeps too much is but half a Man, Sleep rendring him in all Points like a dead Man except his Digestion of the Food; for he neither sees, hears, speaks, or understands, and is absolutely deprived of all Reason; which, for the Time, is a perfect Death. Superfluous Sleep moreover, both in sound and firm Bodies generates Shortness of Breath, and is a constant Forerunner, and Preparative to an Apoplexy, Lethargy, Palsy, and Numness, and it hinders the seasonable Evacuation of the Excrements, causing them to remain longer in the Vessels and Guts. Sleep ought to be taken at such a Time as the Stomach is free from all smoaky Food, the Vapours whereof arriving at the Brain, are congealed and made heavy, and then falling down, they obstruct the Members. But on the contrary, too much watching, and want of Sleep generate over much Heat in the Brain, cause Anguish of Mind, and a bad Digestion; for by watching, the natural Heat is weakened, which occasions Crudities. Sleep is good for flegmatic Persons; because it concocts the crude Humours, whence afterwards is generated Image 52 (page 84)good Blood, whereby a Man becomes more warm, the natural Heat being increased by the Plenty of Blood. Sleep moreover is very useful in choleric Persons, both to quiet the Mind, and to correct the Constitution of the Body: But it is most of all requisite in melancholy Men; for by Sleep they acquire a competent Stock of Heat and Moisture, things very contrary to their Constitution. Sleep, in the Day time, and after Dinner, is not to be allow'd, unless a Man has accustomed himself to it, or has not rested well the Night before, or perceives a kind of Lassitude or VVeariness thro' all his Limbs; in these Cases he may sleep after Dinner, especially if his Stomach be weak and cannot digest the Food: But post-meridian Sleep ought to be taken in a Chair, and not to be above an Hour long. In long Days Sleep may be taken in a Chair, if the Strength be decayed. Some indeed forbid sleeping adays, especially after Dinner: But I think it is not injurious; for so the Spirits, weakened by Labour and Cares, are refreshed; and I cannot indeed see why it is worse than nocturnal Sleep, only it hinders Sleep anights, and makes the Nights seem long and tedious. The ordinary Time for Sleep is seven Hours; for that Time seems sufficient for perfecting Digestion, and refreshing the Spirits: But some require more Sleep, some less; so Children require more, and old People, choleric, and dry; because it moistens and restores the Spirits: But fat and flegmatic People should not sleep much. Such as labour much ought to sleep long. It signifies little on what side you lye at first going to sleep. It is injurious to sleep with an empty Stomach. Sleeping on the Back hurts the Reins, and hinders Breathing, and furthers Diseases of the Nerves. The Signs of sufficient Sleep are a Lightness and Agility, which spreads its self over all the Body, and chiefly the Brain, whereas Heaviness of the Body, and Page 85unsavoury Belchings, signifie that more Sleep is required. To conclude, moderate Sleep restores the animal Faculties, helps concoction of the Victuals, and crude Humours, causes a Forgetfulness of Labour, and of all sorrowful Thoughts, mitigates the Grief of the Mind, moistens all the Members of the Body, restores all the wasted Faculties, augments the natural Heat, increases radical Moisture, clarisies and strengthens the Sight, takes away Weariness, refreshing the tired Body, and stops Fluxes and Rheums: But if immoderate, it makes the Head heavy, troubles the Mind, weakens the Memory, and all the animal Faculties, makes the Body cold, multiplies Flegm, extinguishes the natural Heat, induces a nauseating, makes the Face pale, and is hurtful to all slegmatic Diseases. Waking is an Intension, or rather an Extension of the Soul and Faculties thereof, to all the Parts of the Body; which, when it is moderate, stirs up and excites all the Senses, disposes and orders the vital Faculties to their Operations, expelling and driving forth all the superfluous Humours from the Body; but if immoderate and excessive, it generates Diseases of the Head, corrupts the Temperature of the Brain, causes Madness, kindles the Humours, excites sharp and acrimonious Infirmities, makes Men look pale and lean, and weakens the concoctive Faculty, dissolves the Spirits, fills the Head with Vapours, makes the Eyes hollow, increases Heat, causes Crudities in the Stomach; therefore let Sleep and Waking be always moderate, and if a Man cannot sleep, let him take at least some Repose with his Eyes shut, which in some sort may supply the place of Sleep. Image 53 (page 84) 1 page duplicate	 Page 85 1 page duplicate	   Image 54 (page 86) CHAP. XII. Of Motion and Rest. MOtion is here Labour and Exercise, as walking, playing at Ball, running, riding; they excite natural Heat, and consume all the Crudities of the Body. Some Exercises are strong and wearisome, and others moderate and gentle; the temperate Exercise is that which contributes much to the Health; for it corroborates the natural Health, wastes the Superfluities, enlivens Youth, chears old Age, and hinders Fullness, fortifies the Senses, renders the Body light and agile, strengthens the Nerves and all the Joints; for by Exercise all the Parts become more robust; it consolidates the Members, helps Digestion, keeps the Passages of the Body clear and open, so that the smoaky Vapours of the Spirits may find a better and more free Issue. The gentle Exercises are fishing, fowling, and such like Divertisements, which clear the Mind: And, as moderate and temperate Exercise does wonderfully contribute to Health, so overmuch Idleness is very pernicious. Frictions are also exceeding useful; for they hinder the Humours from falling into the Joints, and being used in the right Time, that is, when the Superfluities shall be evaporated from the inward Parts, they help Digestion, recreate the Body, and open the Pores, whereby the moist Humours, and Vapours of the Body obtain an easier Passage; also draw the Blood to the outward Parts, and confirm the natural Heat. Exercise is to be used so long as the Body can bear it, without growing too weary, that is, till you wax hot, Page 87having a fresh Colour, and begin to sweat, which, as soon as you perceive, change your Cloaths, and dry well all the Members, and put on other Cloaths, and if it be necessary, lye a little in Bed and rest your self, till you shall be refreshed, and recover new Strength. Shooting with a Bow is counted a proper Exercise for the Breast and Lungs; bowling for the Back and Reins: But riding on Horeback is the best Exercise of all, and may serve instead of all. The Time for Exercise is before Meals, having first evacuated the Excrements of the Belly and Bladder; for it is usually very bad and destructive to exercise the Body presently after Meals, and this is the Source of divers Infirmities; but Labourers and Country People, by continual Custom, labour without Injury, as soon as the Meat is out of their Mouths. After violent Exercise, one ought to beware of catching cold; for the Motion and Exercise having opened the Pores of the Body, the cold easily enters therein, bringing along with it Catarrhs, and diverse other Infirmities. Friction or rubbing is to be used in the Morning, after having been at Stool, which must be performed on the extream Parts of the Body; begin at the Knees, and proceed to the Feet, then the Thighs, then from upper Ribs to the lower, then from the Shoulders down the Back, and lastly, from the Arms to the Hands. You must use a Napkin or Towel, gently rubbing your Body, till the Skin wax something red. In old Men the Motion of the superiour Members, as the Arms and the Shoulders, is most necessary, because it diverts and prohibits the Humours from falling into the lower Parts. It is proper for every Person to pull off his Shoes and Stockings himself, without the Help of a Servant; for this is some sort of Exercise, and stirs up the Heat and Spirits. By the by, the binding the Stockings Image 55 (page 88)hard with Garters causes several Pains, and hinders the Heat, Blood, and Spirits from circulating and descending into the Joints, upon which account they are weakened, and apt to receive divers Distempers. In the Morning, as soon as you are up, rub well your Head, and comb it with an Ivory Comb, from the Forehead upwards to the Crown, then with a rough Cloath or Sponge rub your Head,; for hereby the Superfluities which are lodg'd there will be expelled, and the Spirits rarified, and the Passages of the Head opened, and the Memory and other Faculties of the Mind corroborated, and the Sight strengthened. It is also good to shave the Beard often, because it chears the Man; so does the washing of the Face and Hands; the Eyes are also to be washed with fresh Water, and the putting the Eyes into cool fresh Water, open, wonderfully clears and purifies the Sight; afterwards dry them very well with a clean Towel. Take care also that your Teeth be very clean, which for want of well rubbing and cleansing, causes a naughty and stinking Breath, and the Filth of the Teeth mixed with the Food, breeds Corruption, and renders it putrified: Besides, rotten Teeth send to the Brain an infectious Vapour. It is good sometimes to wash the Mouth with Wine. No Exercise is proper after Dinner, but a quiet Composure and Stillness of the Body is most requisite, especially for an Hour after Dinner, after which a little walking is not amiss to digest and jog down the Victuals to the Bottom of the Stomach. Lastly, Those Exercises are best which are performed in the open Air, rather than in Houses, in the Sun rather than in the Shade. Those that by some Accident or other cannot walk, let them ride, or be carried in a Horse-litter, so that they may in some manner exercise themselves before Meals; for by Idleness, and over much Rest, all the Page 89Faculties of Body and Mind are enervated, and Crudities, Obstructions, and infinite Numbers of Diseases are occasioned; and Idleness is reckoned the chief Cause of cold Diseases, it makes Men negligent, sloathful, ignorant, and makes the Body fat, lazy, weak, and causes a pale Complexion, extinguishes the natural Heat, increases Flegm, and fills the Body with Superfluities; it occasions the Gout, Catarrhs, Obstructions, and the falling Sickness; therefore when at any time you are necessitated to be in Idleness, or by some Business or Incumbrance are forced to abstain from all manner of Exercise, you must, instead thereof, observe a slender Diet, and use that Food which is of most easie Digestion, and Broaths, which, without any Trouble or Difficulty, are digested and distributed thro' all the Body, and cause a Slipperyness of the Belly. Superfluous Rest being therefore so very injurious, and Sloath and Laziness the Cause of so many grievous Diseases, as we see those in Prisons always fall into Diseases, it behoves us to use moderate Exercise, whereby Superfluities may be removed, the Causes of so many Diseases. Moreover, we ought not to neglect the Exercise of the Mind, for as the Body with Exercise is rendred strong and robust, so the Mind is nourished by Studies, and acquires fresh Vigour; and many, by a continual Exercise of the Mind, have freed their Bodies from great Diseases. The Exercises of the Mind are Speculation, singing with musical Instruments, the Study of History, Divinity, and the like; for these things delighting the Mind, feed it in such sort that all the Virtues become more strong, and better enabled to resist and overcome Infirmities; and these Exercises performed at due Times, that is, after a perfect Concoction of your Victuals, both nourish and corroborate the Mind, and render the Memory quick and lasting. But if these Exercises of the Mind are Image 56 (page 90)used out of season, they hinder Digestion, and heap up and contract many Superfluities, and occasion various Obstructions, and putrid Fevers. To conclude, Hippocrates affirms, that moderate Exercise is above all things most necessary for flegmatick People, and for such as are of a cold and moist Constitution, and that for hot and cholerick Persons, Rest is very fit and commodious. Moreover, all learned Physicians agree, that both Exercise and Rest, if moderate, are a special means to preserve Health, and prolong Life.   CHAP. XIII. Of things to be evacuated. THings to be evacuated and retained are the Excrements of the Belly, Urine, insensible Transpiration, the Courses, and the Seed; for these evacuated in due Time, and in due Quantity, conduce much to the Preservation of Health, otherwise they injure the Health. The Excrements of the Belly not evacuated in due Time, occasion cholic Pains, and cause stinking Vapours in the Stomach and Mouth. These Excrements, in their natural Estate, are somewhat soft, and stick together, the Colour is brownish, and they do not stink very much. The Urine, when it is right, is of a yellow Colour, of a moderate Thickness, with or without a Sediment. When there is a Sediment it is white, light, and equal, and the Quantity is equal to the Liquors taken in. When it is retained too long, either by the Fault of the Reins, or of the Bladder, or because the Matter of it is not sufficiently separated, it occasions a Dropsy, Fainting, sleepy Diseases, a Palsy, and the like.

Whilst Randolph and Cowley lie embalmed in their own native Wax, how is the Name and Memory of Cleveland equally prophaned by those that usurp, and those that blaspheme it? By those that are ambitious to lay their Cuckows Eggs in his Nest, and those that think to raise up Phenixes of Wit by firing his spicy Bed about him? We know you have not without passionate Resentments beheld the Prostitution of his Name in some late Editions vended under it, wherein his Orations are murthered over and over in barbarous Latine, and a more barbarous Translation: and wherein is scarce one or other Poem of his own to commute for all the rest. At least every Curiasier of his hath a fulsom Dragooner behind him, and Venus is again unequally yoaked with a sooty Anvile-beater. Cleveland thus revived, dieth another Death. Unnumbered page You cannot but have beheld with like zealous Indignation, how enviously our late Mushrom-wits look up at him, because he overdroppeth them, and snarl at his Brightness as Dogs at the Moon.

Right Reverend Father in God, YOVR Lordship hath often times call'd upon me to goe out and shew the people their Transgressions, and the House of Iacob their sinnes. Next to my owne conscience I confesse my selfe bound to give your Lordship satisfaction. Image 3 (unnumbered page) To fall foule upon the degenerous and intractable nature of this people cannot answer you, for it doth not me. I doe not say I am not eloquent, and therefore that you would send by the hand of Him whom you should send. When I am indeed able for these things, I doubt not to have Him with my mouth, because I meane to leave all my selfe out. There was never more provocations for all men to speake then now, when all the mischeife that other ages did but imagine are practiced by a Law, and in the meane time the dumbe Asses are taught to forbid the madnesse of the Prophets. The Harvest is confessedly Great, but then the Labourers are not few. And if while so many are thus excellently imployed about the rest of the Building, some one or other doe as well as he can towards the making good of the Ground worke, I thinke he may be let alone at least.

The course I have runne here is Labour too, and in the same Vineyard. And I trust my selfe for this, that my accounts will be as well pass't above, if I reckon upon these paines, the pretence whereof though not so popular, yet is as substantially proficient towards the maine Aedification. I have principally endeavoured to redeeme my Reader from that slavery, by which I have so long sate downe my selfe, in not printing (so neare as I could I have not) the same things over againe. I am sure I have set downe nothing but what I beleive, if more sometimes then I well understood, I have company enough, and the acknowledgement of an errour is more ease to me, then the committing of it was. Why I should make these Addresses to your Image 4 (unnumbered page) Lordship there is all the reason in the world; what have I but what I have received from you? and that which is, would be Nothing of it selfe. Rayes of incidency contract no warmth upon the Earth, unlesse reflected backe upon their originall Sun. My Lord, As once the Sonnes of the Prophets said unto the Man of God, Behold now the place where we dwell is too streight for us. We are humbly expecting the last course of that Iudgement which began at the House of God.

Betwixt your Highness and the Parlament, I, purpose not to cherish that Dissent, Which lately was begun; nor do intend That, which may justly you, or them, offend; But rather, to unite you so together, That, Disadvantage, may befall to neither By what, your Adversaries hope to finde Effected; (if, you have a changing minde) And, upon hope whereof, they did prepare To act, according as resolv'd you were.   I am not for my self, yet, grown so wise That, when at hazzard, Publick safety lies, I can be silent; though I both disease My self; and others, oftentimes, displease, By my expressions, who, have pow'r and will, To mischieve me, who, purpose them no ill: For, though a well approved Author sayes, To please great men, it merits not least praise; I think, he merits more, who speaks in season, Truths, warranted by conscionable Reason, (Although on him, a Prince's wrath it brings) Then, if he flatter'd Parlaments and Kings.

For, though we know there is in every thing, But one Essential Truth; yet, thence may spring Such various Illustrations, as perchance, The certainty thereof, may much advance, When it appears, they, did the same Truths own, Whose judgments, to each other were unknown: For, when there is thereof no mediation But, as their spirits have communication, It doth assure, it flow'd from Providence, And, not from any carnal influence.

THE Work I have undertaken, is so difficult and obnoxious to Doubt and Error, so slippery and obscure, that it must be confest, by any Man of a solid Judgment, that I have been bold, to make an Adventure upon such a Subject: But the Genius of it being so generally acknowledg'd, it will admit of much Candour and Alleviation, from all Men of an honest Principle, and sober Understanding. 'Tis true, I have scaled the Mountains, and scrabbled above the Clouds, and open'd a little the Curtains that hid and separated the Secrets of Heaven from Common View; and sometimes, likewise, have dived into the profoundest Secrets and Depths of Nature, and at a distance look'd into the Divine Councels, and made Enquiry into the Affairs of the other World; but with so much Modesty, and so little Pragmaticalness, that it will not be easie for any, but a man of a contentious Spirit, to find out Matter to accuse me of. If there be any that will take upon him to be my Adversary, I challenge him to outvy me; and if he can (as I question not but he may) find out new Matter, and a better Method, I shall thank and commend him for his Industry. But if Men can only pick out a single Paragraph, or particular Circumstance, and nibble at it with their Teeth, and bawl loud with their Tongues, and proceed no further; 'tis a poor Game for a Man of good Sence to play at. But I hope this Book will not meet with any Reader of this Tribe: But if it do, I desire and entreat him to go on with my Observations to the end, and put all the  in non-Latin alphabet 	, and strange Appearances of Providence, Nature, and Art, into one Text, and meditate seriously upon them, and try to solve all the Difficulties of them, and give us one more System of Philosophy, that may give a full Satisfaction to Humane Reason, in these Things to the World's end.

Concionari t�m Faeminis qu�m Viris licitum. That Women ought to preach as well as Men.  IT were a hard Chapter to impose Silence on Women; or to say more plainly, 'twere madness to think they can be Pythagoreans, unless Pythagora's Soul by his way of Transmigration could creep into, and masculate their Female Bodies. Nay, it might be thought repugnant to Reason also, to suppose that Woman, who are flesh and Blood, as Men are, should be as mute as Fishes. Aesops demure Cat transformed into a Woman, so soon as a Mouse appeared, forgot her new Nature, and instantly meawed: so let but a Question be started in the Parliament of Women, and 'tis an even lay, they'l all be Speakers. Well then, that they may make use of their Tongues, the most agil and best member they have, and for that very purpose given them, must be by all allowed fit, since they never took Hippocrates his Oath, nor Image 6 (page 2) indeed could ever any yet oblige them Silence. For if the Tongue be the proper Instrument of Rhetorick to exhort and work upon the He�rts and Ears of any Auditory, why not the Tongue of a Woman, who is the perfection of Mankinde; whose majestick Eyes command Attention, whose smiling attractive looks win and charm the Affections; whose smooth and stately Foreheads seem to awe men into obedience; whose Lips (which are the doors of Eloquence) breathe nothing but Harmony: and in fine, whose Angelick Faces, speak both Peace, Hope, Joy, and Happiness, even when they themselves are most silent? But you'l object, that though the power of their Rhetorical and Harmonious Countenances is really effective to dehort or animate, disswade or captivate their attentive Auditors, and draw all their eyes and hearts together, as it were, into a purse-net, yet are they scarce fit to meddle in Sacred affairs, or of capacity enough to preach, expound, and set forth the deep mysteries of Divinity You'l farther object perhaps, that they are ignorant, by reason they have not studied or seen the Academies, nor conversed so much with learned men, whose rational Discourses might have better instructed them. To this I answer, They are of the long Robe also, and spend most of their time in dressing their Heads especially, and that there are few wise Women, Page 3 but do converse with men, and that frequently; either by traversing Cases of Conscience when that pricks them, or opening the case when full of intricacy, or by displaying the Body of Divinity, in orderly spreading the Limbs, and dividing each part of the Text, and handling each natural member thereof with as much dexterity and cunning as can be desired. As for Controversies, who more versed in them then they? For Schooling, School-Points, and moot questions, who more studied in them then they? And as for Degrees, though they commence not from, or amongst the Muses, who are all Female too) yet in all publick places, who minde, study or take them more, or who observe more their degrees of gradual preheminence? Nay, as some of the Disciples vainly questioned amongst themselves, who should be greatest in Heaven? So no doubt but they believe or hope at least, that their Heralds will marshal and place them according to their Husbands ranks and qualities in the other world also: That they are honourable and worthy of their degrees is undeniable; onely whether they have arrived to a competent degree of Learning, is the Dispute now in question And I pray who need doubt it? their first Mother Eve did eat of the Tree of Knowledge, and that same Knowledge hath been as it were ex�traduce, derived from her, attributed to, and propagated Image 7 (page 4) in that cunning Sex particularly ever since. Indeed in this learned Age who is ignorant? Where so many Teachers are, who can want knowledge? When Lay-men do preach, why not Lay-women? when blue Aprons can hold forth, why ought not the white Aprons, those gentle flags of Peace and Innocency be set up and displayed? Examine their occult qualities, and you will soon acknowledge, that who ever bears the Bell away, yet they will ever carry the Clapper, which speaks for their interiour parts, and ever proclaims them most worthy. Weigh but their deep knowledge in Naturals, their profound experience in Physick and Metaphysicks, and set Sololomon aside, (who got his wisest knowledge too, as may be presumed, by his frequent converse with that Sex) you shall finde more wit and cunning in some Women, then you shall perceive in most Men. For observe it, besides him, and those few that came out of the East, how few wise men are recorded in the Scriptures? But for wise and holy Women, how many? Again, if Witches (who are generally reputed wise Women) may fill up the number, (though Holy Writ mentions but one famous, that of Endor) yet with how many such Sages doth this latter and wiser Age swarm, even to amazement? And in holy Story how many Prophetesses were there? I dare say, far exceeding the number of Page 5 the Prophets, the small ones and all put together. But what need I look so far back? Though Epiphanius upbraided Marcion, that he suffered Women to baptize; and though he derided the Romanists that they made Women Bishops, yet have we not had Pope Ioan of Mentz sitting supream in the Apostolick Chair, poizing the Crosier with as much infallible judgement, uncontroulable reason, and with as much gravity and cunning experience as other Spinsters do handle their Distaff? The pregnant Church then big with miracles, implored the aid and Midwifery of a Woman-Bishop; and may she not now again grown big with another Tympany of Heresie, relie on the skill of another Iuno Lucina? How diligent were these famous Empresses Eudoxia and Pulcheria courted and sollicited by the Pope for the establishment of Easter? How did Pelagius strive by his frequent Letters to win the Empress to his side? How considerable were Women then in Church-affairs? And as Iulia in publique Coins had the honour to be stiled the Mother of the Army, of the Gods, the Senate, and her Countrey; So why may not the learned Women of this age (if they but live unmarried, without a head, like Queen Elizabeth) hope in time again to become heads themselves, and Nursing-mothers of the Church? For tell me, where should Learning reside but Image 8 (page 6) in such compt and ornate heads? Where should the Kernel of Knowledge dwell, but in such sage and polite Shells? Where should the saltness of Wit that seasons our souls borrow that sarcasmatical tartness they have, but from their powdred Locks, ingenuous Tiara's, and gay Embelishments? And though I will not use this as an Argument further, then as daily experience proves it in the negative; yet we may generally observe, that there are not so many natural Fools of that Sex, as of the other, though it be termed the weakest. All Anatomists have observed, that Cor in homine, Lingua in Faemina, is ultimum moriens; the Heart of a Man, and the Tongue of a Woman hath the last motion: which vigorous life in that nervous member doth sufficiently demonstrate, that Nature, who made nothing in vain, did intend that the Womans Tongue should not be idle, but be ever imployed for the benefit of Mankinde, as from whom we do all indeed first learn our Mother Tongue, For since Truth it self goes naked, where should she be found but amongst Women, who in imitation of her go almost naked also; and keep their Pulpits ready both for Lay and Clergy-men to preach in. To conclude then, Speak they may, and teach too, but that ought to be the Catechism to their Children at home; they may do neither in the Page 7 Church: and do things decently and orderly they ought, as that they may best do in their Closets and Dairies.   Paradoxical Assertion 2.   Plures sunt Mundi. That there are more Worlds then one.  A Sophister amongst other Theses, maintained this, Non esse nisi unicum mundum, which position his opponent sophistically confuted out of our Saviours words in St. Luke, where the ten Lepers being cleansed, and but one returning, Christ expostulates after this manner, Nonne decem facti sunt mundi? If therefore, said the Argumentator, it be true which Christ hath averred; then is the Position false, and there are ten Worlds. The ingenious Moderator instantly confuted this fallacious Argument out of the Context, where Christ addes, Sed novem, ubi sunt? Non est inventus nisi his unus. Where are the nine? There is none found save this one. The re-party was as smart and quick-witted, as the other fallax was idle and frivolous. But I shall not need to bring such vain impertinent arguments Image 9 (page 8) into the field to maintain this Problem, since upon very good grounds and reasons I shall evidence that there is, another World, to wit, in the Moon, and shall make that World appear as clear as the Sun it self to any man of Reason and Judgement; that is not Moon-blind, or pertinaciously obstinate. Let not any man therefore conclude me Lunatick or mad in asserting this Novel, before he hath weighed my Arguments in the equal scales of an unprejudicate understanding. For let the indifferent and unbyassed Observatour look but into the bottom of this Well, where this truth hath lain so long hid, and he shall clearly see in the serenity thereof, if not another world besides this one reflected; yet at least a World of Reason, by the help of which Reason, he shall draw out thence many more Worlds then this Orbicular Globe of Water and Earth which we tread on. Well may I therefore conclude that great Victor of the World, Alexander, most ignorant, (though Aristotle was his Tutor) as well as most unhappy and miserable, in wishing there were more Worlds to conquer, who never knew or dreamt of any other World, save this he lived in. And in truth so may I conclude of all other prophane Worldlings, like unto him, who fix and set up their Herculean Pillars here, supposing a Page 9 Ne plus ultra here on earth. For had that mighty Nimrod of Kingdoms lived but till now in this Speculative Age, I should not onely have convinc'd him of this Plurality of Worlds; but by Demonstration, and that without the help of Galilaeo's Prospectives, have shew'd him one more in the Moon, besides this, or that other hereafter. Origen was of opinion, there should be more worlds successively one after another; fearing, saith Bodin, God should be idle: or as Plato suggests, lest Mankinde being destroyed, God should want Praise and Sacrifice. Ridiculous Conceits! 'Tis a plurality of Worlds at present I contend for. Every Childe can see the Man in the Moon; and shall not Men of riper Judgement and clearer Eye-sight see and conceive more men there, and believe also that it is habitable? Do not those dusky Spots there plainly represented, perfectly resemble the Earth, whilst the white and brighter parts there are the Sea, as Plutarch, Thales, and Pythagoras affirm? How manifestly doth a Melancholy Astrologer discover Hills and Dales there, and the like Promontories and Concavities? If the Sun then be the Centre of the World, the Earth a Planet moved about the Sun, the Planets inhabited, each having his particular fixt Centre, and they all dancing in a Celestial Chorus and Harmony about the Sun: If they be of that infinite Image 10 (page 10) vastness and distance one from another, as that our World to one there should appear but as Punctum indivisibile, small in respect: as all our Copernical Heaven-Lopers and Neoterick Astrologers affirm, as knowingly, as if they had used Icaromenipus his wings in Lucian, to have flown thither, and seen what was done in Heaven. Why may there not be then infinite Worlds? Why may not an Infinite Cause (as God is) cause and produce Infinite Effects? Iob insinuates as much; Who shaketh the Earth out of her place. Well may we then admit of Brunus infinite Worlds and Suns; of Keplar's Lunar Geography; and believe with Campanella, Galilaeus, Origanus, &c. that the Earth hath motion, is a Planet, and shines like the Moon, to these Lunar Inhabitants. Is not the World then in the Moon's face, as plain as the Nose in a mans face?Credat Iudeas Appella. Besides, Is there not a World of Knavery, Bribery, Simony, Falshood, Deceit? &c And is not man himself another Microcosm, the exact Epitome of the Greater contracted into a lesser form? Since then every man is a World, and in that little World are concentred a world of Fancies, Imaginations, Thoughts, &c. then certainly we may conclude, that there are a World of Worlds, besides this one material Orb of Air, Earth, and Water which we breathe in.   Page 11 Paradoxical Assertion 3�   Plures tollit Medicina, qu�m attollit. That Physical Purgations kill more men then they cure.  A New Physician had need of a new Churchyard: I dispute not who kills safest, the Galenist, or the Paracelsian. 'Tis all one whether a man dye by a Steletto or by a broad Sword. Yet I say, no doubt but God hath appointed the Means as well as the Cure, though but few know the right Cause. For the Lord hath created Medicines of the Earth, and he that is wise will not abhor them. I honour the Physician with the honour due unto him, for, in the sight of great men he shall be had in admiration. But you'l reply, What shall become of Poor men that cannot entertain them? Marry at that distance, best; admire their Confidence onely, and have least to do with them; for such onely are Healthiest and Happiest. Where do they live longer, then in the Orcades, Forest of Arden, Norway� &c, or Sounder, then there where the name of Physick is not once heard of? Quot Themison aegros Autumno occideret uno? Nay, they are rewarded too for their murthers: Image 11 (page 12) they are the Common Executioners: their Art (if one) is but Conjectural, full of Imposture, the Devil Apollo the Inventor of it: and if success follow, it is by Chance, not their Cunning: or Nature had done it without them. Many Diseases they cannot cure at all, as the Stone, Apoplexy, Strangury, Gout, &c. Tollere nodosam nescit medicina podagram. What wise man then, like the tender Lady or rich stall-fed Citizen, would be so jealous of his Health, that if his Finger or Head but ake, or a Stitch vex his Side, will straight consult the Physician, aggravate his slender Malady, make himself sick with Conceit, as his Doctor with impertinency, stir up a silent Disease with frequent Purgations, purge his Soul out of his Body, and kill himself, in fine, in right earnest? What is this but to provoke Nature, stir a Jakes, trouble the Humor, and not to discuss it; or at least make a strong Body weaker, as by often brushing fine Cloth is worn thin; to play with Death, or rather to fight with it; to tempt God, and to tire out our frail bodies with Physick, when Nature alone is the best, safest, and wisest Physician. A Iove principium. Prayer and a bunch of Figs, and that but outwardly applied, prolonged Hezekiah's life fifteen years. With this Pan-pharmacon alone, Luke the Evangelist cured all Diseases. And though our Saviour would work by means, Page 13 and cure the Blind man with Clay and Spittle; yet how often was his onely Fiat, or, Be thou whole, the Restorative? No matter then whether Hippocrates or Paracelsus administer, Paul or Apollo, it is God that gives the increase of Health the Blessing. As Paracelsus therefore adscribes Hippocrates fortunate Cures, not to his Skill so much, as to the peoples strong Conceit of his Worth and Skill: so am I perswaded that many Patients, through the strong Fancy they have of the Doctor, (let the Remedy be never so ordinary) and by Gods help together, recover. The Physicians modesty with the Patients patience work it out sooner, then the desperate practices of Mountebank Quacking Harpies, who to get a Fee will purge the Purse to be sure, and prescribe Death to the next comer; or, like Tinkers, stope one hole, and make two for it. Change of Air (which alone cures rotten sheep) or Linen do refresh, and often change the sick from the worse to the better. Miser� vivit, qui Medic� vivit. A man had as good be buried alive, as observe the strict nice Rules of our severe Lessians and Galenists. The Physician here is the onely Disease, or worse. Their Method is a Torture. First, Phlebotomy. A preparative Clyster. Then a Purge, Vomit, Phlebotomy and Clyster repeated. And then a Purge, a Purge, a Purge, till nothing is left Image 12 (page 14) either in Purse or Body, This causeth that Cacochymia they observe in the enervated body. And then indeed Remedium omnium malorum, Death follows, the certain Cure of all Diseases. In the cure of an Ague, the very shame of all Physicians, what can Aesculapius prescribe better then Exercise and Sweating, which a laboring man cannot avoid? What cures a Surfet, Quartan� &c. like fasting? For the small Pox, a careful Nurse to keep the Patient in, and to drive them out, is best: Experience tells us, they onely dye that tamper; for where one miscarries of it in the Countrey, twenty dyes of it in the City, though visited by the whole Colledge. I approve not of Magical Charms, Exorcisms, Holy Water neither, that's to drive out one Devil with another worse. Nor of the Turks obstinacy, to neglect the Means, because their Dayes are numbred. No, every man is a Fool or Physician to himself at least, and best knows the Regiment of his own Health, and what is most hurtful. Let him but shun that, and use but these three, Prayer, Fasting, and Patience, and the Cure is done: and never Purge but in cases of great necessity.   Page 15 Paradoxical Assertion 4.   Nulla est in Conjugali Coitu Voluptas. That there is no pleasure in the Coition with a Mans own Wife.  IN defending this seeming Paradox, I shall not assert any Opinion Heterodox to Theological Truth, or Logical Reason. I approve not of a plurality of Wives with the Turks now, or none at all with the Benedictin Monks, or Jewish Esseni, who both supererogate in a fruitless Chastity. I commend not the Irish Divorcement once in use, who like the Syracusian in a tempest, when the ship was to be exonerated of the weightiest things, threw his Wife first over-board; take any occasion to put away their Wives. I shall not excuse Adultery upon our Saviours milde reprehension of the Woman in the Gospel; nor argue with our Profaner Wits, who because they are inhibited lying with another mans wife, conclude it lawful thence for a man to lie with his own mans wife. No: Odi prophanum vulgus & arceo. I hate being evil for company; or by such an ingenuous fallax, like that old Sophister Satan, to cozen my self and others with such Jesuitical Sophisms into direct Image 13 (page 16) Atheism. I shall neither with the C""&thari condemn second Marriages"

THe Books of this Learned and much esteemed Anthony Le Grand, now to be published in English, are the Institution of PHILOSOPHY, the History of NATURE, and a Discourse of BRUTES: Which said Books have been so well received by the Learned, that several Impressions have been made and vended here in England, and in Forein Countries. And now to this Great Work, the said Author for the publick Good has made such large Additions, as well as Alterations therein, that nothing material is wanting to make it an entire Body of Philosophy, and is rendred so facile as to be of use and delight to the meanest Capacities. And for the making this Work the more acceptable to the Curious, it shall be Illustrated with about 100 Sculptures dispersed through the Work, to such Chapters as best admit thereof; all designed and drawn Historically by good Artists. And besides the said Ornamental Sculptures, there are great variey of Schemes for the Explanation of the Philosophical Parts that require the same. This Work, as aforesaid, is divided into Three Books: The first treats of the Institutions in 10 Sections or Parts; First, Of Logick, divided into 23 Chapters. Secondly, Natural Theology, or Metaphysicks, in 16 Chapters. Thirdly, Daemology and Created Spirits, in 11 Chapters. Fourthly, Of Natural Philosophy in general, and of Bodies, in 25 Chapters. Fifthly of Special Natural Philosophy of the World and Heaven, in 23 Chapters. Sixthly, Of the four great Bodies, viz. the Earth, Water, Air and Fire, in 23 Chapters. Seventhly, Of Living Creatures in general, as Fourfooted Beasts, Creeping things, Birds, Fish and Insects, and in particular of Plants, in 23 Chapters. Eighthly, Of Man, as it respects his Body, in 23 Chapters. Ninthly, Of Man, as to his Mind, Affections or Passions of the Soul, in 14 Chapters. And, Tenthly, Of Ethicks or Moral Philosophy, treating of the right ordering of a Mans life, &c. in 37 Chapters. The second Book, viz. the History of NATURE, in 9 Parts, which illustrates the first Book of the Institutes, and consists of great variety of Experiments, relating to the several Parts thereof, and explained by the same Principles. The third Book is the Tract or Discourse of Brutes, giving a Mechanical Account of their Operations. The French for some years past have Printed their Books in their own Language, which has been a very great improvement to real Learning and Knowledge, even in the Female Sex, to their great commendation, and much to the Honour of the Nation; which Reasons may be sufficient for the Printing this Work in our Native Tongue. And as this Work can't but be acknowledged by all, to be of great use for the advancement of real Learning, as well as Entertaining and Pleasant, so 'tis hoped Encouragement will not be wanting chearfully to embolden the Undertaker, Richard Blome, to finish the same; wherefore he humbly tenders these Proposals.  The PROPOSALS. 1. Those that please, for the Advancement of so good a Work, to Subscribe and pay to the said Richard Blome, or his lawful Assigns, by Writing under his Hand and Seal, Fifty Shillings, shall have one of the said Books in Sheets; Twenty Shillings to be paid the said Richard Blome, when about half the Book is printed, if so required by the said Richard Blome, upon the delivery of a Receipt under the Hand and Seal of the said Richard Blome, and the remainder to be paid on delivery thereof in Sheets. And such as are curious in their Books, may have them of a finer sort of Paper gracefully Ruled and carefully Bound, or the Sculptures illustrated in Colours, paying the Charges thereof. II. Such as for the further Encouragement of this Work, will be greater Benefactors, shall according to their generosity have one or more of the said Books, as aforesaid, with a Memorial of their Arms and Titles (so as allowed by the Heralds) Engraven either at the beginning of the Book, or to a Sculpture as Patron thereof, to remain to future Ages, as Promoters to so good a Work; and if to a Sculpture, then at the beginning of the Book also. And it is desired that the Mony so subscribed above 50 s. the price of the Book, be advanced to the said Richard Blome, for and towards the said Charges of the Arms and Sculpture, for which a Receipt shall be given by the said Richard Blome, under his Hand and Seal. III. Such as procure Subscriptions for Six of the said Books, shall upon the payment of the Mony due for the same, have one of the said Books in Sheets presented them gratis.  Altho' the Subject of this Work is very useful and delightful, and performed by so good an Author, and Illustrated with such great variety of Sculptures, all done by the said Author's Directions, suitable to the Subjects, and that the Book is set at so low a rate; yet considering the badness of the Times, and the great Charge in Printing, there will be but a very small Impression made, which will be Printed by Michaelmass Term, 1693. Subscriptions being a voluntary Act and Encouragement, if performed, 'tis desired that none Subscribe, but such as will readily recieve their Books, and pay the Mony according to the Proposals by them Contracted for. For Advancement of the said Work, I promise to receive of the said Richard Blome, his Executors or Assigns, One of the Books, and pay the Sum of  _____  according to the Proposal; Witness my Hand this  _____  day of  _____  Anno Domini 169 _____   Image 2 (unnumbered page) An Account of the said WORK. ANd forasmuch as PHILOSOPHY, the Subject of this Work is of so copious an extent, comprehending the Nature, &c. of all Things that the Mind of Man is capable of knowing: Therefore for the better satisfying of such as desire to be Subscribers, 'tis thought convenient to give a short Account of the principal Heads therein Treated of.

WITH A Recipe at the end, how to recover a Bishop if hee were lost.   LONDON, Printed in the yeare 1641.    Image 2 (unnumbered page) Page 1 THE TRUE CHARACTER OF AN Untrue Bishop. With a Recipe at the end, how to recover a Bishop if hee were lost. IF you aske me of what calling hee is, I answer, I know not; for sometimes I find him in Tribunali, in a Court of justice; sometimes in suggesto, in a Pulpit: In the first, so much against Gods will, in the second, so much against his owne will, that as hee hath not a right to the one, hee prizeth not a right to the other. And what can I call this man? 2 If you demand of what Religion hee is; I know not. Hee doth protest hee is not a Papist, and I would willingly beleeve him; yet hee persecutes Protestants, and so I must necessarily doubt him. Hee is to me like the Pictures, which by severall lights, hold forth a severall representation: On the one side you see a pleasant Angel, on the other side a grim Satyr. 3 Hee alwayes either acteth or commandeth contradictions: Image 3 (page 2)For hee calls a Puritan an hypocrite, because hee useth long prayers; and yet placeth all his religion in a daily Service of two houres long. 4 Hee disclaimes Popery, and yet challengeth his function by succession from the Pope, who lineally descends from Peter; though (like the Pope) hee succeeds Peter in nothing but denying his Master. 5 Hee cryeth, No Bishop, no King; thereby professing Episcopacy the chiefe hand-maid of Monarchy; and yet exerciseth, contrary to law, regall jurisdiction in his owne name, and his own Courts. Is not this slily to supplant Monarchy? 6 Hee is a true patterne of Judas, who of all the Apostles is stiled a Bishop; for hee cryeth, Haile Master, King of the Jewes, and then kisseth him with a treacherous designe. Just as an Elephant, who croucheth to his Master, till the youthfull blood doth begin, ebullire, to boyle in his veins, and then hee tramples upon him. 7 Hee saith that Miracles are ceased long agoe, though hee worketh miracles every day: For hee maintaineth universall grace, and yet forbiddeth preaching, the meanes of grace. 8 Hee institutes (quo jure I know not) Saints dayes, or holy dayes, and yet will not permit any holinesse that day, either in our generall or particular calling: For work, men may not; and heare Sermons they cannot, there being none. 9 Hee exceedingly magnifieth that sweet and holy prayer, that prayer which is most full of strength and affection, which is the patterne of prayer, the Lords prayer; and yet maketh this the meanes whereby hee would take away all use of prayer, while he wrappeth up all in that, and makes that a pillar to uphold his No-prayer, his Bidding-prayer. 10 Hee feareth and shunneth Crosses as much as another man, and yet maketh the Crosse a maine (medium) means of all his devotions. Page 3 11 Hee contends with the two Witnesses, Reve. 11.10. as the Magicians of Egypt did with Moses and Aaron, who should be most powerfull in Miracles: They, during the time of their prophecy, shut up heaven that it raine not; Hee, during the time of his dominion, commands the malignant Intelligences, that plagues, murrains, famines, new diseases fall downe no lesse frequently, than haile, raine, or snow. 12 And as hee worketh miracles, so miracles are wrought upon him; for hee is all this while, Talp� cacior, blinder than a Mole, and seeth not, that all his efforts are but that rage which the Prince of the ayre must expresse, as his time hasteneth, are but the Bishop his last thrusts: For Romes Civill and Ecclesiasticall tyranny, with all the dependances thereof, are falling, like a milstone into the sea; God being now ready to poure, or in pouring out the fifth viall. But all this hee seeth not, else (as Solomon saith, Goe to the Ant thou sluggard) hee would learn even with Rats and Mice, to withdraw from the tottering house of this his Hierarchy, unwarranted in Scripture. Hee hath eyes and seeth not, eares and heareth not, and so is it with all those that listen to him. But light is comming, and (which is the greatest miracle of all) they who are the maine enimies, shall be chiefe authours of a most glorious Reformation, and that by opposing it. 13 Hee thought with his Predecessor, the Pope, not to have left Lay men other helps in Divinity than Imagery, calling Images Lay mens bookes. But Lay men have of late so outstript him in that study, that all Episcopall Theologie concentred in one, will bee but the Image of the true Divinity, which may bee found amongst Lay men. Witnesse those mighty Comments made by some worthy members, of the most honourable assembly of the house of Commons, upon those Monstrous, Babilonish, Menstruous Cannons of theirs, which have nothing good in them but this, that by their eminency in their kind, they have not left posterity a possibility of exceeding them. 14 He, by his consecration, makes holy that which God hath made common; as Bells, Bel ropes, Candles, Corporalls and Altars: Orpheus could advance from vegetative to sensitive; for Image 4 (page 4)plants and trees were ravished by the sweet and charming touch of his instrument; But a Bishop can doe more: That which is common, hee maketh holy. 15 Hee againe can abase that which God hath exalted: For by execration hee doth anathematize the soules of most pretious Saints. By his consecration hee doth advance: By his execration hee doth abase: And who may controle him? Divisum imperium cum Jove Papa tenet. The Pope reignes as God. 16 Hee puts holinesse into the stones of the Temple, and it is hee that rendreth unholy, that maketh stony his owne heart and the hearts of his followers, which men call the visible Temples of the holy Ghost: Witnesse his many Sparrowish, Wren-like wanton extravagances which wee meet with from men of that coat in our Committees, and have knowne complained of in the high Commission. Divisum imperium cum Jove Prasul habet. The Bishop reignes as God. 17 Hee is learned in almost all arts and sciences: Hee is an excellent judiciall Astrologer; for whereas Picus Mirandula, Julius Caesar, Cornelius � Lapide, cum multis aliis, deny any certaine knowledge of our condition by the influence of celestiall bodies, hee saith boldly and truly, Let him bee but under the gracious aspect of Charles his Waine, and hee is confident all will doe well. 18 He is no lesse skilfull in the Metaphysicks, for whilst hee hold unitie,""hese words"

Image 2 (unnumbered page) Unnumbered page A BRIEFE DIScourse, touching the happy vnion of the Kingdomes of England, and Scotland. DEDICATED IN PRIuate to his MAIESTIE. I DOE not finde it straunge (excellent King,) that when Heraclitus, hee that was surnamed the obscure, had set foorth a certaine booke, which is not now extant: many men tooke it for a discourse Image 3 (unnumbered page) of Nature, and many others tooke it for a Treatise of Policie, and matter of estate. For, there is a great affinitie and consent, betweene the rules of Nature, and the true rules of Policie: The one being nothing els but an order in the gouernement of the world, and the other an order, in the gouernment of an estate. And therefore, the education and erudition of the Kings of Persia, was in a science, which was termed by a name, then of great reuerence, but now degenerate and taken in ill part. For, the Persian Magicke, which was the secret literature of their Kings, was an obseruation of the contemplation of Nature, and an application thereof to a sense politicke �	 taking the fundamentall Unnumbered page lawes of Nature, with the branches and passages of them, as an originall, and first modell, whence to take and describe a copie and imitation for gouernement. After this manner, the foresaid Instructors fet before their Kings, the examples of the celestiall bodies, the Sunne, the Moone, and the rest, which haue great glorie and veneration, but no rest or intermission, beeing in a perpetuall office of motion, for the cherishing, in turne, and in course, of inferiour bodyes. Expressing likewise, the true manner of the motions of gouernement, which though they ought to bee swifte and rapide in respect of occasion and dispatche, Image 4 (unnumbered page) yet are they to be constant and regular, without wauering or confusion. So did they represent vnto them, how that the Heauens do not inritch themselues by the Earth, and the Seas, nor keepe no dead stocke or vntouched treasure, of that they drawe to them from belowe, but whatsoeuer moysture they doe leuie and take from both the elements in vapours, they doe spend and turne backe againe in showers, onely houlding and storing them vp for a time, to the end to issue and distribute them in season. But chiefely they did expresse and expound vnto them, that fundamentall lawe of Nature, whereby all things doe subsist and are Unnumbered page preserued: which is, that euery thing in nature, although it hath his priuate and particular affection and appetite, and doth follow and pursue the same in small moments, and when it is deliuered and freed from more generall and common respects: yet neuerthelesse, when there is question or cause, for the sustaining of the more generall, they forsake their owne particularities and proprieties, and attend and conspire to vphold the publike. So, we see the Yron in small quantitie will ascend and approach to the Load-stone, vpon a particular Sympathie. But, if it bee any quantitie of moment, it leaues his appetite of amity with the Load-stone, and like a good Patriott, falleth Image 5 (unnumbered page) to the earth, which is the place and region, of massy bodies. So againe, the water, and other like bodies, doe fall towardes the center of the earth: which is, as was saide, their region or Country. And yet, we see nothing more vsuall, in all water-workes and Ingens, then that the water (rather then to suffer any distraction, or disunion in Nature,) will ascend: forsaking the loue to his owne region or Country, and applying it selfe to the body next adioyning. But, it were too large a digression, to proceede to more examples of this kinde. Your Maiesty your selfe, did fall vppon a passage of this Nature, in your gratious speech of thankes vnto Unnumbered page your Councell. When acknowledging Princely, their vigilancye and well deseruinges, it pleased you to note, that it was a successe and euent aboue the course of Nature, to haue so great a change, with so great a quiet: forasmuch as suddayne and great mutations, as well in state as in Nature, are rarely without violence and perturbation. So as still I conclude, there is, as was saide, a congruity betweene the principles of Nature, and and of Pollicie. And, least that Instance may seeme to appone to this assertion, I may, euen in that perticular, with your Maiesties fauour, offer vnto you a Type or Patern in Nature much resembling this present euet in your state: Image 6 (unnumbered page) namely earthquakes, which many of them, bring euer much terror and wonder, but no actuall hurt; the earth trembling for a moment, and sodainely stablishing in perfect quiet, as it was before. This knowledge then, of making the gouernment of the world, a mirror for the gouernement of a state, beeing a wisedome almost lost (whereof the reason I take to be, because of the difficulty, for one man to imbrace both Philosophies;) I haue thought good to make some proofe, (as farre as my weakenesse, and the straights of time will suffer,) to reuiue in the handling of one particular wherewith now I most humbly present your Maiesty. For, surely, as hath beene said, it is a forme of Unnumbered page discourse, anciently vsed towardes Kings. And, to what King, should it be more proper then to a King, that is studious to conioyne contemplatiue virtue and actiue virtue together. Your Maiesty is the first King, which hath had the honour, to be Lapis angularis, to vnite these two mighty and warlike nations of England and Scotland, vnder one Soueraignety and Monarchy. It dooth not appeare by the recordes and memories, of any true history, nor scarcly by the fiction and pleasure of any fabulous narration, or tradition: that euer, of any antiquity, this Iland of great Brittaine was vnited vnder one King, before this day. And yet, there be no Mountaines or races Image 7 (unnumbered page) of hils, there be no seas, or great riuers, there is no diuersity of toung or language, that hath inuited or prouoked this ancient separation, or diuorce. The lot of Spaine was, to haue the seuerall Kingdomes of that continent (Portugal onely except,) to be vnited in an age, not long past: and, now in our age, that of Portugal also, which was the last that held out, to bee incorporate with the rest. The lot of France hath beene, much about the same time likewise, to haue reannexed vnto that crowne, the seuerall Duchies and portions, that were in former times dismembred. The lotte of this Iland, is the last reserued for your Maiesties happye times, by the Unnumbered page speciall prouidence and fauour of God: who hath brought your Maiesty to this happy coniunction, with great consent of harts, and in the strength of your yeares, and in the maturity of your experience. It resteth therefore, but that, (as I promised) I set before your Maiesties Princelye consideration, the grounds of Nature, touching the Vnion and commixture of bodies; & the correspondence which they haue with the groundes of Pollicie, in the coniunction of states and kingdomes. First therefore that Position, vis vnita fortior, beeing one of the common notions of the minde, needeth not much to be induced or illustrate. We see the Sunne (when he enters, & while he continues Image 8 (unnumbered page) vnder the signe of Leo) causeth more vehement heates, then when he is in Cancer: what time his beames are neuerthelesse, more perpendicular. The reason whereof, in great part, hath beene truely ascribed, to the coniunction and Corradiation in that place of heauen, of the Sunne, with the foure Starres of the first magnitude, Syrius, Canicula, Cor Leonis, & Cauda Leonis. So, the Moone likewise, by ancient tradition, while she is in the same signe of Leo, is saide to be at the heart, or, to respect the hart. Which is not for any affinity, which that place in heauen can haue, with that part of mans body: But onely, because the Moone is then (by reason of the coniunction Unnumbered page and neerenesse with the starres aforenamed) in greatest strength of influence: and so worketh vppon that part, in inferiour bodyes, which is most vitall and principall. So, wee see waters and liquors, in small quantity, do easily purrifie and corrupt: but, in large quantity, subsist long, by reason of the strength, they receiue, by Vnion. So, in Earthquakes, the more generall doe little hurt, by reason of the vnited weight, that they offer to subuert: but, narrow and particular Earthquakes, haue many times ouerturned whole townes and Citties. Image 9 (unnumbered page)So then, this point touching the force of Vnion is euident. And therefore it is more fitte to speake of the manner of Vnion. Wherein againe, it will not be pertinent, to handle one kinde of Vnion, which is Vnion, by victory: when one body, doth meerely subdue another, and conuerteth the same into his owne Nature, extinguishing and expulsing, what part so euer of it, it cannot ouercome. As, when the fire conuerteth the Wood into fire, purging awaye the Smoake and the Ashes, as vnapt matter to inflame. Or, when the bodye of a liuing creature dooth conuert Unnumbered page and assimilate foode and nourishment: purging and expelling whatsoeuer it cannot conuerte. For, these representations doe aunswere in matter of Pollicie, to Vnion of Countreyes by conquest: where the conquering State dooth extinguish, extirpate and expulse any parte of the estate conquered, which it findeth so contrarye, as it cannot alter and conuerte it. And therefore leauing violent Vnions: wee will consider onelye of naturall Vnions. The difference is excellent, which the best obseruers in Nature doe take, Image 10 (unnumbered page) betweene Compositio and Miltio; putting together and mingling. The one beeing but a coniunction of bodyes in place, the other in quality, and consent: the one, the mother of sedition and alteration, the other of peace and continuance: The one rather a confusion, then an Vnion, the other properly a Vnion. Therefore we see those bodies which they call Imperfect� miltio, last not, but are speedily dissolued. For, take for example, Snow or froth, which are Compositions of ayre and water: in them you may behold, how easily they seuer and dissolue, the water closing Unnumbered page togeather, and excluding the ayre. So, those three bodies, which the Alchymists doe so much celebrate, as the three principles of things, that is to say, Earth, Water and Oyle, (which it pleaseth them to terme Salt, Mercury and Sulphur:) wee see, if they bee vnited onely by composition, or putting togeather, how weakely and rudely they doe incorporate. For, water and earth, make but an vnperfect slime, and, if they be forced togeather by agitation, yet, vpon a little setling, the earth resides in the bottome. So, water and Oyle, though by agitation it be beaten Image 11 (unnumbered page) into an Oyntment. Yet, after a little setling, the Oyle will floate vppon the toppe. So as, such vnperfect minglinges, continue no longer, then they are forced: and still in the ende, the worthiest getteth aboue. But, otherwise it is, of perfect mixture. For, wee see those three bodies, of Earth, Water and Oyle; when they are ioyned in a regetable or Minerall, they are so vnited, as without great subtiltie of Arte, and force of extraction, they cannot Unnumbered page bee seperated and reduced into the same simple bodyes againe. So as, the difference betweene Compositio and Mistio, cleerelye set downe is this: That Compositio, is the ioyning or putting togeather of bodyes, without a new Forme: and Mistio, is the ioyning or putting togeather of bodies, vnder a new Forme. For, the new Forme, is Commune Vinculum: and without that, the oulde Formes, will be at striefe and discorde. Image 12 (unnumbered page)Now, to reflect this light of Nature, vpon matter of estate: there hath beene put in practise in gouernment, these two seuerall kindes of pollicie, in vniting & conioyning of states & kingdomes. The one to retaine the auncient formes still seuered, and onely conioyned in Soueraingtie; the other, to superinduce a new forme agreeable and conuenient to the entire estate. The former of these hath beene more vsuall, and is more easie: but the latter, is more happy. For, if a man doe attentiuely reuolue histories of all nations, and iudge truly therevpon: hee will make this conclusion, that there were neuer Unnumbered page any State that were good commixtures, but the Romaines: which because it was the best state in the worlde, and is the best example of this pointe, wee will chiefely insist therevpon. In the Antiquities of Rome, Virgill brings in Iupiter, by way of Oracle or perdiction, speaking of the mixture of the Troyans and the Italians: Sermonem ausonij patrium, moresque tenebunt. Vtque est, nomen erit: comisti corpore tantum Subsident Teucri, morem, ritusque sacrorum Adijciam, faciamque omnes vno ore Latinos. Image 13 (unnumbered page)Hine genus Ausomo mistum quod sanguine surget, Supr� homines, supr� ire deos pietate videbis Wherein Iupiter maketh a kinde of partition or distribution, that Italy should giue the language and the lawes; Troye should giue a mixture of men, and some religious rites, and both people should meete in one name of Latines. Soone after the foundation of the Citie of Rome, the people of the Romaines and the Sabines mingled vppon equall termes. Wherin the interchange went so euen, that (as Liui noteth) the one nation gaue the name to the place, and the other Unnumbered page to the people. For, Rome continued the name: but, the people were called Quirites, which was the Sabine worde deriued of Cures, the countrie of Tacitus. But, that which is chiefly to be noted, in the whole continuance of the Romaine gouernment, they were so liberall of their naturallizations, as in effect, they made perpetuall mixtures. For their manner was, to graunt the same, not onely to particular persons, but to Families and linages: and not onely so, but to whole Citties and Countries. So as, in the end it came to passe, that Rome was Communis patria, as some Image 14 (unnumbered page) of the Ciuilians call it. So, we read, that Saint Paul, after he had beene beaten with Roddes, and therevpon charged the Officer with violation of the priuiledge of a Citizen of Rome: the Captaine then sayde to him; Art thou then a Romaine? That priuiledge hath cost mee deere! To whome Saint Paul replyed: But I was so borne. And yet, in another place Saint Paul professeth of himselfe that hee was a Iewe by tribe. So as it is manifest that some of his Ancestors were naturallized, to him and to his descendents. So, wee read, that it was one of the first despights that was Unnumbered page done to Iulius Caesar, that whereas hee had obtayned Naturalization for a Cittye in Gaul, one of the Cittizens of that Cittye, was beaten with roddes, by the commaundement of the Consul Marcellus. So wee read in Cornelius Tacitus, that, in the Emperour Claudius time, the nation of Gaul, that part which was called Comata, the wilder part, were suters to bee made capable of the Honours of beeing Senators and Officers of Rome.

It is most true, that most Unnumbered page Estates and Kingdomes, haue taken the other course: of which this effect hath followed, that the addition of further Empire and territorie, hath beene rather matter of burden, then matter of strength vnto them; yea, and further; it hath kepte aliue the seede and rootes of reuoltes and rebellions, for many ages: As, wee may see in a freshe and notable example of the kingdome of Aragon, which though it were vnited to Castile by mariadge, and not by conquest, and so descended inhereditarie vnion by the space of more then a hundreth years: Image 16 (unnumbered page) yet, because it was continued in a diuided gouernement, and not well incorporated and cemented with the other Crownes; entred into a Rebellion, vpon point of their Fueros, or liberties, now, of very late yeares.

And now, my Lord, I have made bold to give you the trouble of this Address, and present these few Papers, though small in bulk, yet vast in matter, to your hands, both upon my own, and the Authors account. Upon mine own, who have ever been your most humble Unnumbered page Client, and have had your noble Friendship and Favour to countenance me in all my private concerns: And moreover, you do as Chief Magistrate, govern that City in which I was first educate in the Peripatetickwalks, and under, and in which, I have for divers years profest Letters, or practised Chyrurgery and Physick; and with the rest of my fellow Citizens, have found such refreshment under your Shade and Care, that I thought it my duty to signifie it by this small testimony of my thankfulness.

Your most humble Servant, Robert Turner.   Unnumbered page To the Reader, Whose Studies are seasoned with Salt. WHEN the rude dark Chaos, and indigesta moles, lay tumbling in darkness, and rowling amongst the undivided waters; when the Spirit of the Great Eternal Elohim, moved above Image 6 (unnumbered page) the Face thereof, it seemed good to his Great creating power, to make a Witness of his Glorious Majesty, by framing the spatious �niverse: then did he pronounce a fiat Lux, Let there be Light: and no sooner was his will declared, but Light immediately, like a ready swift-wing'd Herald, soon proclaim'd his Embassage to the as-yet unseparated Fire, Air, Earth and Water: Unnumbered page and they, as dutiful Subjects, yield ready Obedience to his Glorious Commands; and Light speedily muzzles up darkness, and presents the Creator with a new baptized morning. His sacred Power further intending to manifest his Glory, commands a divorce between the Earth and Water; and as a mighty Monarch doth his conquered Enemy, or Image 7 (unnumbered page) stubborn Rebel; so he with another fiat, makes that terrible, boundless, fathomless Element, the Sea, become his Prisoner; and confines her swelling waves to their bounds and borders; banishing them from one end of the World to the other, to run up and down in an unsettled motion; that though her brinish Mountains swell never so high, yet further then his great fiat permits, Unnumbered page they never dare approach. Then after he had vanquished this terrible (to poor mortals apprehension) adversary, he soon bespreads the Earth with a green robe, embroyder'd with such variety of glorious flowers, as the greatest Potentate on the earth, with all his Glory, could never attain to the like array. Moreover, did his refulgent Majesty yet further illustrate the Image 8 (unnumbered page) beams of his glorious might in bedecking the bespangled azure skies with those powerful Creatures the Sun, Moon, and Stars, which he set for times and seasons, days, months and yeers; and to divide betwixt day and night: to omit the ready obedience, the Sea, Air, and Earth yielded, in bringing forth fishes, birds and beasts, immediately at his command. Whither now doth Unnumbered page my wandring Muse soar? What royal Potentate or princely Guest, should now be expected to this glorious Entertainment? Not the Mighty Angels, that excel in strength; but the great Deity, call'd a triune Council, & commanded the Earth also to bring forth an Epitomy of all his voluminous works, the Manual of his glory, Man, a naked puling Creature, born without Sword or Image 9 (unnumbered page) Shield; yet into his Soul did the All-eternal breath the Image of Himself, crown'd him glory, made him little lower then the Angels, made him Commander of Earths Empire, gave him an os sublime, a lofty countenance to view the Stars, and learn to know their powerful influence upon the inferiour World.

The advantage and commodement of the publick in general, was the perfect Achme of this enterprise, in trimming our Author in this Garb, to which, if these endeavours adde but one grain, or Atome, (though scattered by the hands of weather-beaten Imperfection) we shall acknowledge it not onely the Heroick Carac, but also the Laureat Apex of our Glory. Doubtless (Sirs) this was the fundamental Syntax of our thoughts, to which we determined the designation of Image 9 (unnumbered page)this Translation: but we presume it may meet with a greater influence upon your Acceptations, as most congruous to your stations, being the professed Sons of Apollo, soaring in the highest sphear of Natures Oeconomy, inhabiting the Thurisick Groves of Rerum Natura, attending the sproutings of their variegated Offspring. The benefit you may receive hereby (after some serious exagitation) we partly understand by the glimpse of that more than ordinary Illustration our formerly clouded Genius is now bespangled with. The peroration, as to reversion of that utility which may by futurity accrew, here imploreth (Sirs) both your resentment and communication. Can any Copy be so gratefull to ingenious persons, than that whose stamp appears in the beaten path of Antiquity? wherein there is no Jurgia Mentis to pertarr your cogitations from delabing through the Golden Chanels of Experience. Sirs, here you will finde the confused Recipes, and linsy-woolsy-conceptions of Physicians ranged into an exact method, their Enigmatical expressions unforked and unvailed, their cloudy sentences artionobolized into rayes of Light. Ignorance beskreens the soul, here our Author discovers the dawnings of knowledge, by breaking open the hidden Caverns of Nature, and explaining the secreta, or occult qualities of her multifarious Vegetables. Here the whole Pharmaceutical Art is denuded, and redacted to the clear intelligence of the meanest capacity, claiming your attentions, whil'st it affords instructions to conduct you to a clear prospect of Via recta ad vitam longam, promising a Medicine for every Malady, and a Balm for every Soar. Here you may behold Phoebus skipping from the Bowers of Neptune, and by his darting through the Casements of Heaven, gracing the cincture of the day with his radiant complexion, glistering with Robes of silver, shooting life and Unnumbered pagespirit by his beams into the fruits of the Earth. Here you may see our Author traversing many lofty Heaven aspiring Mountains, and anon conducting you into the pleasant Penaean Valleys. Here you may sit upon the diapred brim of the Universe, and accumulate Nose-gayes of Roses and Gilliflowers, Medicines for scent and savour, cordial and reviving. Here you may view how this lofty Turret the Earth is bespread with Daffadils and Prime-roses, Cowslips and Columbine; and the Amber Locks of Ver dallying with the Eglantine Banks of Bravery. Here you may view the superbious Trees presuming to elevate their tops in the sacred Skyes, In the three Books of Medicinal Materials. the delicious Bowers of the Woods adorned with the Treasure of Flora's bespangled Drapery, the curled Groves rattling with the bloomy gales, the verdant Leaves flourishing, the Silver streams of pleasant Rivers gliding, the flagrant Meadows braving it with the riches of Autumn, displaying the pride of their beauty; the pleasant Umbrages sporting with Zephyrus-Nectar-Blooms, shining with Titan's transpiercing Darts; and the whole Garden of the Universe embellished with curious Tapestry, glistering Ingeny, and interchangeable Jollity. Here may you see Rhenodaeus plowing through the liquid Intrals of Nereus, dancing Lovalto's upon the azured waves, making Amphitrite display a delicate apparition of Paphian allurement, discovering as it were the stately Battlements of the Mint of Mexico, and the Minerals of Peru; the nature of the Porphyrie, with the virtue of the Saphyre, the Carbuncle with the Topaz, the Emerald with the Chrysolite, the Smaragd with the Margarite. Millions of thanks to debonaire Fortune, that these Ambrosian Delicacies are discovered, before the Postilions of Eolus have fled to Neptune's azured Common-wealth, and our Horizon over-veiled with the Canopie of drousy Vesper (Ignorance.) Image 10 (unnumbered page) In a word, here may you view the enamelled Robe of the Universe, Lady like, spotted with its rosy-locks; whose hair doth not more adorn than profit; whose ruby cheeks are not more admired for their beauty, than for their salubrious virtues desired; whose frank, free, fragrant, and fruitfull Breasts do nourish her own Children sprung from her never resting womb, affording nourishment both to Man and Beast. Insomuch that we may well cry out with Du Bartas; Good Lord! how many gasping Souls have scap't By th'aid of Herbs, for whom the Grave hath gap't; Who even about to touch the Stygian Strand, Have yet beguil'd grim Pluto's greedy hand. O sacred Simples, that our Life sustain, And when it flyes, can call it back again; 'Tis not alone your Liquor inly tane, That oft defends us from so many a bane; But even your savour, yea, your neighbourhood, For some diseases is exceeding good. O great is the powerfull Good that lyes In Herbs, Trees, Stones, and their true qualities: For nought so vile, that on the Earth doth live, But to the Earth some secret good doth give; And nought so rich, on either Rock or Shelf, But, if unknown, lyes useless to it self, Therefore who thus doth make his Secrets known, Doth profit others, but not hurt his own. Sirs, Communication is the primo-genito of Goodness; and why should so singular a benefit longer lye hid?

V. What besides a Physician ought to know before he useth the Gold of the Physician or {sulphur} Philosophor. I Acknowledge that in the former Chapters I have said too little of the {salt}, but the form of = stood in the way, that I durst not make farther mention thereof; for if I should speak what were to be spoken of it, I must also plainly describe the form, which ought not to be done. Now have I handled nothing in this Treatise by Similitudes; but as the thing is in it self, so have I described it: But the Form belongs Page 51 not to the Physician, but to the Mineralist, who may find enough written thereof in Peter Bonus Ferariensis. Therefore is {antimony} sufficiently declared, and as ye see after the simplest manner, that none can exclaim against me, and say that I write so obscurely, that I cannot be understood. To conclude, I warn every man that understands me not, that he go not about to make what I teach; for {antimony} is not for him; but a Secret of God above his understanding: But he that understandeth me, will without doubt put his hope in God, and accomplish what I write. The same shall even know that he hath not therefore found the Medicine wholly, but only begun to learn it; for what is it to have a good Sword in ones hand, if one know not how to draw it forth against our enemy; Image 31 (page 52) we must therefore first know how to use it; so the Physician also though he hath {sulphur} Philos. in his hand, and knoweth not the use, what profiteth it? The knowledg of administring it requireth a very expert Physician; not from the reading of Galen; but from the knowledge of the Microcosme; therefore it is necessary to write diligently of the use of this Secret, which I shall (if God give life and opportunity) speedily do, and not keep it from you; yet thus much will I here manifest to you, that that {sulphur} cannot be digested in, our stomach; but if it be not digested, it's not the Physick it should be; for after digestion virtue goeth out of him, and not before. Mankind hath a gift that is from God, Paracelsus calleth it Archeus; the office of this Archeus is to make mans flesh out of Page 53 Bread, and bloud out of Wine; and what man wanteth, that it maketh out of the Aliment: Now we find that man is not the Medicine, therefore cannot the Archeus out of {sulphur} or 	 make the Medicine; so it followeth from hence that there must be used another Archeus, that this digestion may be accomplished, Paracelsus in his Book De {tartar}, mentioneth this Digestion, how our Stomach is comforted, and saith this Arcanum is 	, which is true, but it is a Speech too subtile and short for your young Physicians: Let no Man be so senseless, as to perswade himself, that this Medicine is to be obtained by the bare letters of Paracelsus. This say I, that he hath a great secret who knows to perfect this digestion in Man; no ordinary Physician shall know Image 32 (page 54) it, for very much belongeth to it; therefore let every one, who by diligent Labour and Operations hath obtained this {sulphur}, not abuse this gift of God, lest he get more shame and scorn than honour amongst the sick. I could, if it were convenient, in few words declare this digestion, and annex it to this Treatise; but it is not convenient, by reason of many secrets which depend thereon; wherefore this Treatise shall be only of the Preparation of {antimony} concerning the Use, I will write another Treatise; by the which, ye shall understand what Paracelsus hath written De Arcanis & Elixiribus, in his Archidoxes. That I write no Receipts in this Book, is, because I will not seduce you, for Receipts are Deceipts to the young Physicians. Further, there is no Receipt in Paracelsus concerning Page 55 Secrets in Physick, which hath not an occult sense, and hath either too much or too little; and this is done, not without great reason. So hath this Treatise of {antimony} an end; in which we have spoken, What {antimony} is, in the first Chapter; in the second, How Mercury is made out of it; in the third, How it must be regenerated by Heaven; in the fourth, How out of Luna Physical Sol must be made; in the fifth, What is further necessary for a Physician to know e're he use this Gold? So much have I undertaken to write of {antimony} for the young Physicians sake, who know not what {antimony} is, that they may not be seduced by the Galenisis, who are not ashamed to write of this Mineral that which they never experimented; what I write, I know that it is true, and this Image 33 (page 56) Work hath not once only gone through my hands, and I know it much better than the Shoomaker his Last: Wherefore then may I not write what is true? Although the Devil be never so black and base, yet in this he cannot bite me: Physick concerneth the Body and the Life, he that writeth any thing thereof, which he cannot prove by his practice, is a Murtherer: For then shall the Galenists escape, whether will they go? Therefore, Reader, if you will take pains, apply thy self to this way as to a firm Rock which is unmovable; yet I pray thee that thou attempt not this Work Illotis manibus, that is, if you understand it not, it belongeth not to you: Ye young Paracelseans, I will also admonish you, Do not as the contrary part doth, dispute Page 57 not much of Physick in your Prefaces, and defend your Masters not only with words, but also by your practice; by your words, you will as soon win the Galenists, as the Apostles did the Heathen by Preaching. Works do all; ye must therefore work; so much as ye perform by Works, so much ye are to be called Paracelsians: Be diligent and careful, for not every one that glorieth that he is of Paracelsus, can do Paracelsus Works; keep your selves from undigested Writings; the Rose hath time for its growth; when your time is come, help the Truth by Words and Works; so shall you tryumph over your Enemies, as Theophrastus did in his life time. Thus I conclude this Treatise. Expect a better. Image 34 (page 58) This have I written in Dutch, that Artificers, Mechanicks, Yeomen, who buy {antimony} and work on it, may know, that they do ill to meddle with that which they understand not.  The End of the first Treatise.      Unnumbered page ALFX. Van SUCHTEN OF ANTIMONY VULGAR. The SECOND TREATISE. LONDON, Printed, and are to be sold by Moses Pitt at the White Hart in Little Britain, 1670.    Image 35 (unnumbered page) Page 61 To the Honourable John Baptista Van Seebach. Noble Sir, MY Honourable Patron, and good Friend, my humble Service in the first place presented to you: At your earnest Request I cannot but accomplish your desires, seeing you have a great love and and affection, by experience to find out the Secrets of Nature, which at this time are known to few, and even wholly hid in darkness. Although many of the Ancients have written thereof, and their Books dispersed, yet are they written in a Magick Image 36 (page 62) stile, and profitable to none but those who from their youth have been trained up in the Magick, or instructed by God in such Secrets. Therefore the Secrets for which you humble your self are in a deep pit, strongly locked up, so that no man can open them unless he have received the Key from the Spirit of Truth. Of the Magical {antimony}, or of that {antimony} of the Ancients will I speak nothing in this Treatise, seeing that men will know nothing of it; but what they read of it they apply only to common {antimony}; of the which you only desire a Treatise, which I will freely communicate to you, and will write, 1. What it is. 2. Of what parts it is compounded. 3. Into what it may be resolved again. And you shall in this Treatise understand me no otherwise than Page 63 according to the Letter; for I will use here no Metaphors, Allegories, or Similitudes; only I will describe {antimony} with a plain stile, that you may not be deceived, though you prepare it according to the Letter, and ye shall obtain that of which I write; by these you may also judge whether in common {antimony} that secret, or Chymical & Physical Mystery be or not, of the which Paracelsus and the Magicians have written. Now {antimony} as it cometh out of the Mountains, is not pure as it should be; for it is mingled with Stones of the Mine. I never saw any that came forth pure from the Mountains; therefore ere one use it, it must be purified, which purification is done by digestion; but this digestion is a sulphureous Fire. The best {sulphur} Image 37 (page 64) is a {sulphur} Metalline, and although Artists do purifie it with the vegetable fire, that is with Tartar, yet is this digestion not natural, But that the Tartar divideth the Regulus from its Faeces, this is the cause that the {sulphur} of {antimony} is more Vegetable than Metalline; but you shall purifie it with {sulphur} that is sprung from Mercury, and not from Salts; for this Metalline {sulphur} will be reduced in the Arg. vive of {antimony} into Arg. vive, and lastly, out of this Arg. vive will pure Gold be made. Now this Metalline {sulphur} that purifieth {antimony} is only in B, & no where else, & this purification is done thus; R. B or Iron % 4 (I am wont to take pieces of Nails which are neither gross nor thick) put them into a strong Crucible, and set them in a wind Furnace, let it stand so long till Page 65 you see the Nails or Iron are soft, then put into the Crucible % 8. of {antimony}, make a strong fire that the B may flow well in the {antimony}, then cast into the Crucible with an Iron Ladle a good handful of Salt-petre; let them boil up together in the Crucible (let the Crucible therefore be considerably great, that it boil not out) and let it stand till all be quiet and flowing, then cast it forth into a casting-pot, so the Regulus setleth it self. So soon as the matter is coagulated in the Puckle-pot, put it out, and let it cool, and strike the Faeces from the Regulus, which appeareth & shineth like a Marchasite: The Faeces you may lay up till you know what to do with it; for in it is a Mystery, of which I will not speak at this time. Put the Regulus into a Crucible again, and let it flow; when it Image 38 (page 66) floweth, then cast therein one % and � of {antimony}, & let them flow well to gether, then put in it as much Nitre as you did before, let it flow as ye did at the first time, cast it into the Puckle, strike the Regulus off from the Faeces, this Regulus is purer & finer than the first, cast away the Faeces, for they are nothing worth, let this Regulus melt the third time in a Crucible, and when it floweth, poure thereon a Ladle full of Nitre, and when you see that the Nitre floweth on the Metal as an Oyl (which must be done with a strong fire, otherwise the Nitre coagulateth it self, and will be hard) then cast it into a Puckle, strike the Regulus from the Faeces; this Regulus is yet finer, purer and more Metalline than the former; the Faeces are nothing worth. Fourthly, let this Page 67 Regulus melt in a clean Crucible, and when it is melted as pure =, cast some Nitre thereon, let it penetrate through each other, & then cast it into a Puckle, beat the Faeces off from the Regulus, which Faeces will be of a golden colour, and then it is prepared. The Regulus will be white as =, and have above a fine Star; this Regulus if it be rightly wrought, will weigh four Ounces, and the work may well be finished in two hours (some Copies say twelve hours) and in this manner is common {antimony} prepared, wherein you shall mark this piece, viz. what it is that thus divideth the Faeces from the {antimony}, you shall not think that Nitre doth it; but{antimony} draweth forth the soul of B, and reduceth the same into ?, and this ? is nothing else but fire. know that Antimony draweth forth the soul from B, that is, his best {sulphur}, and reduceth the same into ?; this ? is nothing else but fire, and hath Image 39 (page 68) the operation of fire, which digesteth the crude ? into {antimony}, and divideth the Mine from the Metal; you shall also know that this ? of B is hid in this purged {antimony}, under the whiteness of Antimonial Mercury; for this Lunary whiteness which you see in this Regulus is not from his {sulphur}, but from Arg. vive, under which lurkethThis ? Martis is 	, and a Spirit, or Air, and remaineth in ? till it be made a body, that is 	. Mercury of Mars, which is nothing else than Sol: this ? of Mars is also nothing else in the aforesaid ? of {antimony} than as a Spirit or an Air, and remaineth so long living in the Arg. vive of {antimony}, till out of it be made a body again, that is {salt}, and then divideth it self from the ? of {antimony}. So now you understand what that fire is which thus purifieth common Antimony; you must also understand what that fire is which purifieth and digesteth Page 69 Magical Antimony, that is, what that Sol Philosophor. is which we call 	 potabile, which even so well divideth it self in the end from ? Philosophor. as the 	 divideth it self from the Arg. vive of Antimony. Therefore it is very necessary that you seriously consider Nature how it worketh, so shall you find what Nature is; not only in common Metals, but even in all things, and in the Metals of Philosophers, which are known to the Wise men. The Alchymists do assay Antimony by Iron; when they have done this, they know not what they have made, nor the working of Nature; ""or do they know what Nature is here: therefore teach they nothing"

And so by a Christian Circulation, the Possessors do, or ought to render to Caesar the things which are Caesar's. Thus Your Majesty hath a double Right to the Mines, and to the Products of the Chimical Art, by which Metals are fitted for their Journey to Publick Commerce. Herein I humbly offer my Endeavours to assist their motions, and onely to refresh your Majesties Memory, not to inform Your Knowledg: for (as 'tis hinted in the Title Page) Your Majesty is (in the Science of Chimistry, as in all Sciences of Humanity) Nulli Secundus. These Perfections are evident in Your Majesties publick and private Elaboratories, from which pure Justice, and pleasing Arts and Sciences are communicated to Your Subjects. Image 3 (unnumbered page) In these I have observed Your Majesties particular respects to Chimistry (of an �niversal Extent,) and thereupon I resolved to transplant this German Twig of L.

Unnumbered page To the Right Honourable, George Marquess, Earl, Viscount Hallifax, and Baron of Eland, Lord Privy Seal, and one of His Majesties most Honourable Privy Councel; and Governour of the Society of the Mines Royal, and Battery Works. My Lord, YOur Lordships free acceptance of the Government of the Mines Royal, hath encouraged me to add it to your Titles, and I hope without the least disparagement to your other Honours, deservedly conferred upon your Lordship by His Majesty. It is a Trust of great Concern (and I doubt not but it will be so managed by your Lordship) and of Honour too, (as it hath been always esteemed) for (not to trouble your Lordship with very Antient Records,) I find that King Edward the Fourth did make Richard Earl of Warwick (who soon after was made one of the Governors of this Kingdom, during its Troubles) and John Earl of Northumberland, his Guardians and Governors jointly of all his Mines in England; and King Henry the Seventh made Jasper Duke of Bedford, and other Earls and Lords, his Guardians also of all the Mines in England (adding Wales.) And Queen Elisabeth, in the 10th. of her Reign, did form the Government thereof into Societies, by the Names of Governors, Deputy-Governors, and Assistants for the Mines Royal and Battery-Works, and then made Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper, and other eminent persons, her Governors for England and Wales, (adding those within the English Pale in Ireland,) which Government did continue Successively to the Earl of Pembrook, and others for some Years: Image 4 (unnumbered page) and after, his late Highness Prince Rupert was made a Governour; and your Lordship to our contentment, doth succeed him. Now, my Lord, As for my self, I have been one of the Deputy Governors for above 30 Years, and do think my self obliged in point of Gratitude to the late Governours, and present Members (who were pleased unanimously to order a Contribution to the Charge of this Book, and for some former Favours,) to endeavour the advancing of their Concerns (especially now we have the Honour to be under your Lordships Regiment,) and therefore as an Introduction to my real Intents, I not only publish this, but by some Additionals, I shall study to make the Government more advantagious to the Society, and much more to His Majesty; and even to other Proprietors of Mines, wherein I have sat still some Years, because I found that I should be obstructed by some who studied the advance of themselves more than His Majestics Revenues, which I do not aim to do by any Oppressing Method, or projecting Humour (for I hate it) but by an honest just way, and I hope not displeasing to any, but such as nothing will please. And these I shall in due time communicate to your Lordship, being so confident of your Lordships great Abilities, (join'd with your perfect Loyalty to your King, and Love to your Country) that your Lordship will not approve of any thing that I shall offer, if it agrees not with your Lordships sound Judgment and deep Wisdom, for which all who knows your Lordship have an high value, and particularly Your Lordships most humble and obliged Servant, JOHN PETTUS.   Unnumbered page To the Noble and Honoured Subscribers and Contributers to this BOOK. My Lords and Gentlemen, I Did design to have publish't your Names in a way that should have more fully manifested your Favours, and my Acknowledgments; but this Book extending to above 50 sheets more than I design'd, or at first proposed, took up my limited time, so as I must respit that intention, for I have not done with this Subject; intending not to trouble you or my self with Subscriptions, but such as have Subscribed to this, shall have notice when the next is ready� and if they approve of this so well as to take the next from me, it will be an additional Obligation to me, for I am prepared to go through the Body of this ART, upon these Reasons� First, That it contains the Grounds and Maxims of most admirable Speculations; and next, That I may divulge their chifest and most curious Experiments and Practicks: Now, that which incited me to this, was occasioned from hence, That having caused Erckern's Books to be Translated about Ten years since; some eminent persons did perswade me (like the Story in Bocalino,) not to publish it, lest the Common sort of People should make an ill use of its impartments, alledging, That it was not well Translated: whereupon I betook my self to the German Language, and in a short time I was so much Master of it, That with the help of a German here, I did indeed find many Errors, and Corrected them, which answers one Objection; and I have Printed such a convenient Number as may answer the other; And yet I am not altogether satisfied therein; for, what hath made Arts and Image 5 (unnumbered page) Sciences flourish more in the time of King Charles the First, and now in His Majesties Reign, than their Majesties encouragements to the free communication of such things as had many Ages before lain secret? so that we hope that all Pancerollus his lost things may in a short time be found again. We punish our selves by fixing and disputing on the Theorems of antient Writers, and thereby making things to be Diabolical, which are only Divine Favours shewn us by Natural Agents, so as for want of knowing the true Practicks & Experiments, they are divulged either by umbraging Sophistications, or concealed under the Name of Philosophical Secrets, which, no doubt, but GOD intends for a publick and common Good: and this ill Fortune befell the �nguentum Armarium, as a piece of Witchcraft, 'till our Eyes were inlightned; and in many other things (which were they clearly communicated) such Superstructures would be raised from them, as might arive us to a kind of Angelical Knowledg in this World, and make us more apprehensive of our Happiness in the next: and therefore it shall be my study to unfold the Metaphysical Notions of this SCIENCE: by Practicks especially about the Philosophers Stone, which Study I value only for its fine Pursuits and Products of Experiments, but more, because the Laborers for it are, by their own Affirmations, obliged to a strict and religious Life: I shall trouble you no further at this time, but with my humble and hearty Thanks: and so subscribe my self My Lords and Gentlemen Your most humble Servant JOHN PETTUS.   Unnumbered page To my Worthy Friend, Richard Manlove, Esq Warden of the Fleet. SIR, I Am here, a confined Person, for my being too kind to others, and too unjust to my self� and for not doing what was not in my Power to perform, by wanting the Justice of my Debtors, whereby I am rather a Prisoner to them than to my Creditors. Yet I can dispense with all these, because they have occasioned my happiness, in your Acquaintance, and my contenting Retirement in this place, which was once a Palace, after, a Staple of Comerce, and long since and still, a Repository of our Laws: And now, like Homers Iliads in a Nut-shell, here are all sorts of Degrees, from Prince to Peasant, all sorts of Professions, from the Doctor to the Novice; all sorts of Trades and Manufactures, and all sorts of Virtues; but your Prudence doth still suppress the Vices. And I ingeniously confess, that by yours, & your Ladies constant Kindness & Indulgence to my declining years, I have made it a Colledge of Learning, and so may other Gentlemen do (if they please) it being so qualified, that in an hours time there is no Art or Science wherein one may not be punctually instructed. Now, Those that think themselves Prisoners to you are much mistaken, for they are Prisoners to the LAWS, and may make themselves Students of All-Souls in Le Fleet, of which you are Warden. A Guardian-ship very needful for the People, as a Completion of J�STICE, in point of Restraints: For, (besides many other wise Considerations) they are good for Cooling the Animosities between Creditors and Debtors, and between the LAWS and Contemners of them, (and thereby prevents the Effusion of Blood, which hath often hapned) and for Curing the sullen and contemptuous Disposition of others to their Superiours. Image 6 (unnumbered page) For, I can truly say, That, by my patient Submission to them and my Misfortunes (being prepared with my 14 months Imprisonment in Windsor Castle, under the late usurped Power) I do now with more Satisfaction to my self, undergo this under a Legal Power, and thereby I affirm, That no Gentleman hath receiv'd greater Respects from you than my self, and therefore I take this Occasion to make my publick Acknowledgments, that it may be a Guid to other mens Contentments, for, as I have observ'd, That as you never were out-Hector'd by Affronts or Resistances, so you were never out-done by Civilities or Compliableness to your Methods. As to the first� I never gave Occasion, and as to the other, my studious temper complying with your Love to Learning have so won on your good Disposition, that I must acknowledg to my honored Subscribers, and others, that had it not been for your Incouragement and particular Assistance with your purse; (though with some Inconveniencies to your own Occasions) I could not have finished this Book, as now I have done, and therefore as one Memorial of your kindness, I have given it the name of FLETA, and in my Picture minted the word insletatus from this Place. I could with delight to my self and others, spend more time on this Subject; but I must end with this request, That as you have given House-room here to the whole Impression of my Books, so you will please (in respect my person is restrain'd in Execution of the Laws,) to encourage it in its Travels abroad; and so not doubting of your Favour, I shall conclude with Ovid (then, in my present Condition, but I will not punish my self with his Tristibus's,) Parve nec invideo sine me Liber ibis in Aulam �rbem Which I have thus Englisht, Go little Book, leave me, but make report, Who treats thee best, the City or the Court. However you shall have the continuing thanks of Your Obliged Friend and Servant� JOHN PETTUS.   Unnumbered page To the Courteous READER. I Think fit before you read this Book, to instruct you in the Method of it, so as you may read the whole, or part, as your leisure serves. 1. It is divided into two parts (as the Title mentions,) viz. Erckern's V. Books, and my Dictionary. 2. Whereas the Original of Erckern's 5 Books had no Numeral distinction of Chapters and Sections, I have divided them into Chapters and Sections, and Printed them before the Five Books, with numeral referrences to their chapters where they are contain'd. 3. Whereas the Sculptures had only Literal, and no Numeral Directions of their Contents, I have in the second part of the Contents before the Five Books, Printed the Contents of the Sculptures, with references to the Pages where they may be seen and read. 4. Whereas the Original of Erckern's 5 Books hath no Coma's, Colons, Periods, Parenthesis, or Interrogatory Points, pertinent to the distinction of Words or Sentences (which are also wanting in many German Books) I have comply'd them to our way of Orthography, (which was no little trouble,) and therefore if the Reader find some few Omissions, they may upon that account be the more kindly dispens't with. 5. I do retain many antient and Saxon Words, upon the account of their affinity to the like Words which are still used among us, and these are hinted in the Dictionary. 6. In the Dictionary or second part, the first Words which I thought fit to explain, are in Capital Letters, and next, the Teutonick and Latine Words for those Capitals; (and other Image 7 (unnumbered page) Languages, as occasion requires,) and these I collected from G. Agricola, Alstidius, Cowel, Minshaw, and Skinners Dictionarys for the Teutonick, from Cooper and Holiock for the Latine; from Florio for the Italian, from Cotgrave for the French; and from Waltons Lexicon for the Oriental Tongues, which, with a German was all the help I had for the use of above 600 Words; but the two chief Languages, of which I make the greatest use, are the Teutonick and Latine, this from the old Romans, (who continued among us above 500 years) the other from the Saxons (who were mixt with us as long,) from both of which Nations we gain'd a particular knowledg of Mines and Metals, as may be evident from many Roman and Saxon Works� which remain here under their Names to this day; and many of our Monarchs, particularly Queen Elizabeth did think fit to desire the assisting SKILL of the Germans, to improve OURS; to prevent which trouble, I here publish part of their Art, and intend more. Lastly, I have given it the Title of FLETA, which is borrowed from an eminent Lawyer, who whilst he was Prisoner in the FLEET, writ his Learned Book of the Common Laws of England, and thereupon (as 'tis said,) he call'd his Book FLETA (Cowel) to which I add MINOR, in submission to his great Learning, and for its affinity to the word MINER, viz. one who Labours in the Mines, as I do in Learning the Metallick Art. To conclude, I have writ some things from Authentick Authors (too many to recite here,) and some from my own Conceptions and Observations; now as they pleased me in writing, so I hope they will not displease others in reading. JOHN PETTUS.   Unnumbered page THE PREFACE OF Lazarus Erckern, To his five following BOOKS. Of the Art of Assaying. TO learn and understand the way of Assaying, Proving and Refining of Metalls, is an Excellent, Noble Science, and an Antient and profitable Art, long since found out by the Art of Alchimy and Chimistry, as also all other Works of the Fire, by which not only the nature of Oars and Mines, and what Metalls contained in them are known; but also how much there is in a Centner, or in greater or lesser Weights, and not only so, but this Art also teacheth how to Examine each Metal by it self, as whether there be any Adulterated or mixt Metal with it; what, and how much the same is, and then which way those Metals may be separated from such mixtures or adulterations, as also by several ways to cleanse and separate other incorporated Metals, so that they may be judged to be fine, clean and free from mixtures, therefore this Art is very profitable to Minerists and such as work in Mines and intend to have benefit by them, and such Artists must endeavour Image 8 (unnumbered page) by all means to learn and exercise themselves in the same, that they may thereby reap a Profit to themselves and others, and preserve themselves from Inconveniencies and Dangers by their want of knowledge therein. By this Art of Refining and the Profit that acrews by it, many good and rich Mines have been discovered, which otherwise would have lain concealed: and by the Advantage of these Discoveries many Cities and Villages have been built, Lands have been improved in their Values, and People thereby increased and plentifully maintained: As also great and mighty Trades and dealings with Gold, Silver, Copper and other Metals here, and in other Countreys exercised, and the Coiners of Coin and Minting Works have been multiplyed by their Guardians and Masters; for from Gold and Silver, Money is made and much improved, so that the true Insight, Tryal and Examination of this Art, cannot be in any wise omitted or neglected, as that which is highly necessary to be known. Rewarded by Princes. And such Artists as have exercised themselves in the Knowledge of Assaying, and fundamentally and diligently practised the same, are by Princes, Lords and Communities thought worthy not only of great Thanks, but been also promoted and recompenced by them. Mother of ARTS. For this ART of Assaying is the very Inlet and Mother of many other honorable and profitable Sciences as Experience teaches us, and the more a man finds out, the more he is stir'd up to the contemplating and doing things of an higher Nature. To know Metals necessary. So that the Knowledg of Metallick Oars and Minerals are first to be inquir'd into, namely, How each one according to their Nature, Figure, Form and Colour are distinguishable from each other: Which without great diligence and daily Practice cannot be known, because God the Almighty Creator, in the beginning of the Creation of the Unnumbered page World, hath placed Metals and Minerals in the Mountains, Valleys and Veins of the Earth, and causeth them to grow there: He hath also given to all and each of them an outward Form and Colour by which the one from the other may be distinctly known. How to use Fire in Metals. Secondly, The Knowledg of the Fire is a principal part of this Science, and very necessary to be inquired into, that he may the better know how to govern the same, so that he may give no Metal more Fire than its due, but to every one its proportion of Heat and Cold, as necessity requires to add or take from it, in its Operation. To make Instruments. After the Knowledg of Governing the Fire, the Artists must have the Knowledg also of making all the Instruments and Furnaces for this, either by his own handy Furnaces.work, skillfully to prepare them, or at least to direct that they may be well made, whereby he may not be hindred in his working, but by his own diligence accomplish them. Weights and Scales. In like manner he must be careful in procuring good and just Scales and Weights, and to know also how to make them (in case such Artificers should be wanting) and fit them to all Metals, and he must have great Care in preserving them from Dust, and that they be alwayes pure and clean so that (as occasion serves) he may rely on the certainty of Proofs by them. To be skill'd in Arithmetick. Next to the former Directions he must be well skill'd experienced and exercised in the Art of Arithmetick, for the numbring and casting up Accounts (which to Assaying Coins and Refining Works are very necessary, and is one of the Master�pieces in this Metallick ART) And every Assayer must not only diligently learn this numeral Science (necessary to be known for the Proving of Metals or what belongs thereto) but also all such Arts and Sciences as may accomplish his full Designs therein. Image 9 (unnumbered page) Now, though it would not have been unserviceable to have writ of all such things more largely in this Preface and Entrance to what follows, as also of the Rise and Springs of metallick Oars, and how they grow in the Mountains, Veins and Chanels of the Earth, and how generated (of which the old and later Philosophers have had many different Opinions) as also of the Streams, Chanels and their Entervals (and other Accidents which do discover and produce Oars, whereby the Miners do guid themselves in their Proceedings and Works.) Yet because it would have been too long and endless to recite the Opinions of Philosophers, and the various Operations of Miners (in respect they do not agree in all things, and miss very much of their Aims, and have written many Books to little purpose) therefore, for brevity sake, I have omitted them, and proposed only my own Practice, for the better advancing this Metallick ART.

Page 3   THIS first Book speaks of Silver Oars, how they may be distinguished by The Purpose of the Book.their several Sorts, and afterwards by Assay-Scales and Assay-Tests; Of Muffles, Coppels, and of Clar for Lead, of Lead-Glass, of Fusion-Pouder, of Ballances and Weights, and how a Lead Grainer may be made, and then how every particular sort may be certainly assay'd or tried, as also of Slake and Slake-stone, Flakes and Hard-Work, See the Dictionary.of Laech-Speize, Black Copper, Pagment, and of Granulations; as also of Planches or Plates of Silver and burnt Silver, with a fundamental Information how to burn Silver in the common way, and under the Muffle: as also the preparing and making Tests: and how to cast Silver which is Tuff or hard, as well as that which is not tuff or more ductile: also how to assay Tin, Iron or Steel for Silver, and to know what any Silver or coined Mony is worth: and to make stroking or touching Needles, or Ingots of Silver for distinguishing the fine from the less fine Silver.  Why Silver first treated of.Now, because I have in this Treatise first begun with the Description of Silver Oar and its Tryals, some may wonder why I did not rather begin with Gold, (which is treated of in the Second Book) and why I did not give Gold the Preheminence, it being the highest and chiefest Metal of the Earth, and so by right it should have been first treated of. Therefore I think fit to inform the READER that I have not done this without good Reason; For, from Silver Tryals, all other Assays and Preparations of Instruments do flow, as out of a Fountain, and have their Rise from thence; for which cause I have judg'd it necessary, in the first place, to give information of the same, and to place it in this first Book, because it is Image 25 (page 4)  to the Honour of the Crown of Bohemia, and bordering Countrys in Germany, viz. Miechfin, Sachsen, Shesren, Manhren, and other Countrys where there are many Mines containing good Quantities of Silver, and many Miners, Gardians of Mines, Refiners, Provers, Smelters and Melters, who exercise themselves in proving of Silver-Oars, and of such Metals as contain Silver in them, and yet because there are many in these parts who have not gained the true Knowledge thereof, or have not in all things pertinent to this Science, obtained a fundamental Information, I have proposed to my self to be serviceable to such, and therefore I have more largely treated of Silver, and its Tryals than of any other Metals, and am not willing to leave this unmentioned in this entrance of what I am to write.   CHAP. II. How Silver Oars are distinctly known.  SectionSIlver Oars are found to be of many sorts and Colours, yet if they be not very fine, they are not to be judged by their Looks (how rich soever they are in Silver) and therefore 'tis proved by Artists (who have diligently search'd into this Science, and by them found out many years past, as also by others who have since improv'd this Art) that the worth of every Oar may be certainly found out, so that the very smelting, melting, refining and account thereof, may be demonstrated both as to its worth and the Charges. Page 5 Now it is here necessary to be known, that so many  as there are Sorts of Silver Oars, so many are their Natures and ways of melting and refining them; and therefore Difference of assaying Oars.the Tryals of Silver Oars must be ordered according to the Nature of the Oars, because the hard, harsh, gross and crude Oars, cannot be proved like those of an easier Fusion; or of a more mild, subtil and ductile nature, because, as an Oar proves either harsh or hard of fusion, so it must be help'd (in the proving) by the Government of the fire, or by other wayes; as, by much Experience in proving such Oars have been and may be discern'd according as they melt in the fire: so that if there be not a knowledg of the Nature of an Oar before melting, and how it will do in the fire, such an Oar, cannot be melted to profit. Now for the better attaining the knowledg of the Difference of Oars; as, which are of an easy, and which of an harsh and crude Fusion; the most excellent and experienced Miners do give every Mine (and Oar from thence) Names, according to their Natures: all which according to the Terms used by them are hereafter named.  Glass-Oar.First, there are reckoned to the Easy-flowing Silver-Oars, these Nominall distinctions, viz. Glass-Oars (as the cheifest of the leaden Coloured Oars) almost to be compared to the best digested Silver, for it doth not loose above a sixth part in the fire, and the rest is pure and good Silver, and this dig'd Oar is a ccounted the best Silver Oar.  White goldish Oar.Also there is found white-Goldish Oar, not that it contains Gold, but because it is good in Silver, it hath this name in respect of its Goodness.  Horn Oar.Also the Horny Oar, (which is called so from its transparency or rather lucidation like Horn) and is very rich in Silver next to the three last mentioned Oars. Image 26 (page 6)  There is a Silver-Oar which is Brown-red (almost like Cinabar, but not so light) and this they call Red-goldish Oar, and this doth yield above half Silver, and it Red goldish Oar.is found that these Oars do break like one another, and the difference not easily discern'd.  Black Oar.As for all Oars which are gray and black in breaking and withall heavy, they are often rich in Silver, but such as break black and light, or brown and yellow are not alwayes rich, and it happens often that there is little or no Silver in them.  Ironish OarAll Ironish brown and Yellowish streamy Oars are from decaying Mines, pierc'd by cold winterly Winds, and these contain some, but are not rich in Silver.  Leadish OarAlso the leadish, or Oar that looks like mud (and therefore call'd muddy Oar) is somtimes rich and somtimes very poor in Silver, and indeed all leaden, horny, stony Oars, if they be yellow, white, gray, black, brown, red or green do not contain in themselves (if no other Oar be mingled with them) much Silver, and for the most part none at all.  Glittering Oar.Also there is reckoned among the Easy-flowing Oars, all such Lead-Oars as are of a bright, glittering, shining Nature, or of a gray, brown or white Colour, yet these of themselves alone have little Silver, but the small flaky glittering or Wismet Oars, from the Mines in Bohemia, as also the much flaky, shining Oars from the Mynes of Fryburgh in Misnia, do contain from 6 to 10 ounces in a centner.  Float Oars many Sorts.Also all float or Easy-flowing Oars that are Yellow, white, brown, blew, green, or gray, do contain near that proportion.  Azure or blew Oar.Also Copper-grass Oar or Copper of a Mountain green, or Copper glass-Colour do hold some Silver, but the Course Oars of an Azure, Mountain-Green Colour, are comonly poor. Page 7  See the Dictionary.In fine, all Silver Oars in all sorts of Mynes free from Flint, Blent, Cobolt, Mispickle, Glimmer, Wolferan, course spelter and Wismet (or be spizy and Copery) are called, saft flowing mild Oars.  Flinty Oars many Sorts.On the contrary, all flinty Oars are reckoned among the harsh, gross and hard flowing Oars, and of these Oars there are also several sorts, namely the gross Flinty-Oar, the water flinty-Oar, and the square flinty-Oar, these contain little Silver (and the most part of them none) or not above half an ounce in a Centner: also Copper-flinty Oars that are yellow like Brass, also the Brown and Blew-staind-Flinty Oars, they do contain much good Copper (as may be Seen in the third Book) but such Oars contain little Silver, yet one sort more than another.  Cobolt blent mispickle Oars.There are also rich-copper-Flinty Oars which have no Silver but the Blent, Cobolt or mispickle Oars (as in Section 11.) if they be speckled or spotted with round black or gray spots, they are sometimes rich in Silver and sometimes poor.  Glimmer, Wolferan, Talk, Cats-silver and sparkling Oar.Also all common-white Glimmer or wolferan (as in Section 11.) or glimmering or sparkling Oars, or Talk or Cat-silver are very poor in silver, yet the black Glimmers are sometimes rich; but for the most part all such glimmery Oars are commonly poor, so as I account these but as Paterns to other metalick Oars.  Spelter and spizy Oars.Also all course-Spelter, spizy or coppery-spizy Oars (as in Section 11.) or the like kind, they are commonly poor in Silver and contain none at all.  Spady Oars.Also all spady Oars (or such as may be dig'd with a Spade (if they be red, green, yellow or white (if there be no other mixt silver-Oars with them) for the most part do contain little or no Silver in them.  Slack and Copper stoneAlso there is reckoned among the harsh, or hard-flowing Oars, the raw slack-stone, and copper-stone, spelter, being Image 27 (page 8)  alike in cleaving and splitting of Furnaces which proceeds from the stirring of the flinty parts, as also from the scummy part in melting them.  The Ways of assaying them.But how the Proofs of the above-named soft-flowing, as also of the hard-flowing silver Oars are to be wrought, I shall by the following DISCOURSE distinctly and exactly inform the READER. Now, because that in many places there are no Workmen who can well make Instruments, belonging to the proving of these Oars, I will for the better Information, shew first what is chiefly necessary to be done in such proofs, both in the whole, and in parts; as also what matter or stuff is to be used about them; as also what Instruments are to be made and prepared for them.   CHAP. III. How the Assay-Ovens to prove Silver and other Metals are to be prepared.  Special Ovens.THERE must be special Furnaces (for Assaying) made of good Potters Clay, and bound with strong Iron wyre or Hoops, that they may not fall asunder by reason of the strong heat which they must endure. But some diligent Assayers which intend to carry on their Work effectually, do form and adorn their Furnaces fairly and comely, so as they may be pleasing to the Sight: This indeed do's Adorning them.give them an adornment, but there is no more done with it, than with a Common Furnace (that is made well, though plain.) Now there are many sorts of Assay-Ovens which Assayers Page 9 made use of according to their several wayes of  working, but this is to be noted, That in one Oven, the Fire is to be better governed than in another, either by heat or cold, as the difference may be seen in the following Sculpture: But I intend to mention first, how the Ancients have made their Furnaces.  Iron Assay Ovens of the Ancients.The Common Assay-Ovens, in which the Ancients have made small Tryals, they have caused to be made square, of strong iron Plates about fifteen Inches wide below, and sixteen Inches high, and sloping from below to the top, so that the square was about ten Inches at the top, and this Square had no Bottom, but in the Fire part it had a Mouth-hole (of four Inches and a half wide) and the other three sides had each of them at the Bottom a wind hole, four Inches long, and one and an half high: there was also every where about the plate, holes cut into it, so that it was ruffe and sharp for the Loam to stick the better to the luting of their Furnaces. To make a good Loam. Now to make such a special good Loam, (as will hold well in the fire) take good and well�wrought Loam, beat among it Flocks of Wooll, or Horse�dung, Blood of Oxen, scales of Iron and common Salt, with which lute the Furnace two inches and a half thick, let it dry, then take small ground Venice-glass, Boneashes, and a small quantity of Loam, mingle it well together, and plaster it all over the inside of the Furnace, let it dry well, then make a gentle fire in it, that it may be neald, and when the Furnace is to be used, there must first be a smooth fire-place, and upon that Copell-Ashes are to be laid the breadth or thickness of a finger, and this on the Furnace must be placed; and in the Oven upon the Fire-place a Muffle (which is formed as the following Sculpture doth shew:) and thus the Assay-Oven is made ready: and when there is any Image 28 (page 10)  Tryal to be made of the Furnace, after it is well glaz'd within by the last plastering over of the Furnace with the Venice-glass and Ashes, it will last the longer. And when the Furnace in length of time is quite burnt out, then the old Loam is only to be knock'd out, and fresh put in the room thereof, and proceed as before. In such a Furnace, he that knows well the Government of the Fire, and is an experienc'd Assayer, may make all manner of Tryals, only the Registers are sooner stopped with the Ashes than the Furnace with the two mouth-holes, of which there will be information hereafter.  Norinberg Assay Ovens made of Potters Loam.Some Assayers do use in their tryal of Furnaces (which are made of Potters Clay, and formed like the above-named Furnace) and tye them with wyre, and set them upon a foot which is broad and hollow, and hath in each of the four sides wind-holes (as the following Sculpture will shew.) And in this Furnace it is more easy to govern the Fire, than in the above named Furnace, because the wind-holes in that Furnace (which are in the foot) do stop themselves easily; and such Assay-Ovens are called Proof-Ovens of Noringberg, and the Muffles appertaining to them, are also seen in the Sculpture.  A slight Assay Oven of Iiles.But if a man should be in a place where no Assay-Ovens are to be had, and yet would assay a few tryals in haste; in such case, Take only a few Tyles, place them together in a square, and leave in the sides Wind-holes, and in the fore-part leave also a Mouth-hole, and with a Pipkin cut in two, make a Muffle in it, and in such Furnaces Assays and tryals may be well performed.  Assay Ovens in which the fire is best governed.But in such Assay Ovens, in which most commodiously Assayes may be made, and in which the Fire may be right and duely govern'd, also as such as are not easily Page 11 stop'd with ashes, and in which all the Tryals (that may  be made in any Furnace) may be tryed, they are to be made thus, viz. eleven Inches wide, and sixteen inches high, which is the full hight of the Assay-Oven, when you have measured eight inches high, then work it a little in, also that the Oven at the top may remain seven inches wide, and the thickness must be one inch and a half, and the lowermost Bottom three quarters of an inch thick, then measure from the bottom three inches high, and four inches and a half wide, which is for the lower Ovens mouth, then measure two inches above the lower Mouth-hole (which is for separating of the upper and lower Ovens mouth:) in like manner measure the height, three inches and a half, and four inches wide, then after a separation of an inch thick, make the uppermost mouth-hole about the bigness of a little finger, so that from the middle of the hole to the top of the Oven there may remain yet six inches and an half, then on both sides of the Ovens-mouth, towards the corner, measure three quarters of an Inch: and make there two holes a pretty-big Fingers widness, which must go strait through the Oven, as also the like behind: when all this is done, you must then also make a declination, from whence the Ashes may fall; which must stand two inches and a half from the bottom, and two inches and a half from the sides of the Furnace, and the declination must stretch hollow upward from the bottom, six inches and an half: Only observe this, That if you intend to make any thing of Clay, then you must add so much as the Clay useth to shrink, because one sort of Clay doth shrink more than another, but most commonly Clay doth shrink the tenth part: When this Assay-Oven is also finished, and is yet soft, then there must be edges cut in it, in which the Iron-bonds or wyer may lay, after that, let it dry well in the Sun, and then let it Image 29 (page 12)  be hard baked in a Potter's Furnace or Brick-kiln.  There are also in like manner Assay Ovens made, which outwardly are of a square form, like the abovenamed Assay Ovens of strong Armour-plate.Furnace, and are made very neat and clean, of strong Armor-plate, and writhen with Ironpins, on which the Lute may stick well, and artificially brought together, also that such a Furnace may be taken asunder into five pieces, which Furnace, like to that of Iron-plate, must be neatly luted with a good and firm Lute, and to the strong plate of Iron at the outside of the oven, there must be little plates to put forward and backward in small Crevices, and so according to necessity the Tryal may be well made: Of such Assay Ovens there is much Estimation made, but there can no more be accomplished with it, than in one of the other mentioned Furnaces, if only an Assayer have well the knowledge of the Fire, after which all Proofs are to be governed, then can he, without question, do well in all these Ovens. In this following Sculpture is to be seen how this and the afore-named Ovens are to be formed, which is thus   Deciphered. 1. An Assay-Oven used by the Antient Refiners, joyned with Iron Plates. 2. An Essay-Oven used by the Norinburgers (in Germany.) 3. The Foot of it. 4. An Assay-Oven made of Tiles joyned together, which may quickly be done. 5. An Assay-Oven made of Potters-Loam, and fastned with Iron Bonds. 6. The upper mouth-hole of it. 7. The lower mouth hole of it. 8. The holes for Iron-barrs to be put in. 9. An Assay Oven made of Armour-plates.  Page 13 Sculpture III.   When any one of these Assay-Ovens is thus prepared, then cause two Iron-bars to be made of an equal length, which must go through the holes that are between the upper and lower Mouth-holes (Figure 6 and 7) and stand out about three Inches, on the out-side of the Oven, on which the plate must rest before the upper Mouth-hole, and cause a bottom-plate to be made no bigger than from the Bars to the lower part of the upper Mouth-hole, and so broad that it may reach a little above the Iron-Bars, and from the bottom-plate towards the sides, so as there may remain near an inch of room on the Back part of the Furnace, whereby the Wind may pass through it into the Oven, so that the fire may do its work. Image 30 (page 14)  To this Assay-Oven there belongs singular Muffles, which may be seen in their full proportions, in the fourth following Sculpture. There must be also a Cover to the Furnace, with little Instruments to be made of Potters stuff, to govern the fire, the Forms of which are also in the fourth following Sculpture.   CHAP. IV. How Muffles, Bottom-plates, Tests, and other small Potters-Work (necessary for Assayers) are to be made.  EVERY Assayer ought to have so much knowledg, that in case of necessity he may be able to make his Assay-Ovens himself, as also his Tests, Crucibles, Muffles and what other �tensils or Instruments are daily used as necessary to Assaying, because there are not in every place Masters of this ART to be found who know how to make the same, and although much pains may be taken to instruct a Potter (in case of Necessity) how to make some Instruments belonging to this ART, yet it often happens that they do not make them well, nor in good shapes; whereby an Assayer may perform his Work: and therefore I (as well as others, when we could not have good Instruments made fitting for us) have been forc'd to make them our selves, which are done thus.  Of preparing Loam for Instruments.Take good Potters-Loam (as good as may be had) but the Loam or Clay that is blew and becomes white in the fire, is found to be the best for use; Let such Page 15 Loam dry in the Sun till it be hard, and when you do  intend to make Instruments of it, let it be well pulverized, then moisten it with Water till it become soft, and let it be well troden or broken with an Iron, then put among it the Washings of Pibble-stones or very fine sand, as much as the Clay can well bear, but that you may not add too much or too little, be sure to make out of such stuff some Assay-Tests or Crucibles, and put into them some hard-flowing Oar and place them in the fire, which will offer thee a Tryal, whereby thou maist see, if the stuff will hold, well, sound and firm; some do mingle among it some Chalk-stone, or the subtile red Talk or Glimmer in such place where there is much of it, but which is most necessary, Experience will teach: some take in stead of it the broken Pots or Crucibles, beaten small and sifted through a sine Seeve, and put so much among the Clay that they may vvork it vvell, because of its britleness, such Crucibles and Tests as are made of it hold vvell, (but vvhen Pibble-stones, as hath been said before, are mingled vvith it, that it doth bind together in the fire, and the bigger the heat is, the more doth it bind) and this Proof-Test may be taken vvhole out of the Frame.  Whem the Loam is prepared you must then have a Frame, in vvhich you may beat the Proof-Test and How the Cases and Frames and Assay-Tests are made.Crucibles: the Frames are best made of Brass, but they that cannot have such may cause them to be made of good Wood of Pear-tree, and an Iron-ring may be put upon it, very closely, that the Frame, by reason of much use may not split or break: then anoint the Frame vvith a little Bacon, and put in it a little Ball of the prepared stuff, as much as may be enough, and grease also the upper part of the Frame, vvhich is called the Monk, and beat the upper part vvith a vvooden Mallet into the Case or Frame, then is the Test formed; Image 31 (page 16)  press it out vvith your Fingers, but have a care that the Clay be not too moist, otherwise you can not press the Assay-Test whole out: Some do put the Case with the Test upon a suddain and quick heat, and so the Test will come out whole, this is a very good way to make the small Crucibles, but with the great Assay-Tests, it would be too long and tedious.  To make Muffles you must have wooden sticks cut To make Muffles of Clay over woodensticks or Fromes.in form of that bigness the Muffles must be, grease them with Bacon, and frame a Lump of Lute or Clay, of a convenient bigness, that it may be cut with a copper wyer, into a thin leaf or piece, and put it over the sticks or frame, and cut out of it such another leaf, as may make it a half round piece, that you may close it behind, all this must be done upon the form, and must with a moist hand be stuck close to it: then let it stand, nigh three hours, that the Clay may be a little hardned, then cut the Muffle out, so as you will have it cut upon the sides and behind; and let it stand yet a little longer, that it may go easily from the sticks: Some do strew a little fine sand or ashes upon the Frame after it is greased with Bacon, that the Muffle may come easily from the Frame: But that many Muffles may be prepared together, therefore cause more than one of these Frames to be made, that in the mean time while one doth dry several more may be made.  But, to the bottom Leafs or pieces you must have How the bottom of them are to be fram'd.Frames of Wood, in Widness as the bottom leafs are, thick and broad; they must be prest full with the prepared Loam, then they will dry quickly, and come out easily; or cut out of a piece of Clay, a leaf with a small wyer, so thick as you would have it, and shape it further as is necessary.  Of drying and calcining the Loam for Assaying.These Tests, Muffles, Bottoms, Leafs and Crucibles thus prepared, must be very well dryed, and then in a Page 17 Kiln or Potters-Oven well calcined, although the Muffles  and bottom Leaves are also used raw and uncalcined in the Assay-Oven, but there must be a very gentle fire, and the fire in the Assay-Oven, must first be kindled from above, downwards, and so they will remain whole, otherwise they will all fly in pieces; and thus you are fully instructed how the Potters-Clay is to be made into Instruments, and if they be not good and firm they are a great hindrance to the Assayer: the Forms of vvhich are truly to be seen in the follovving Sculpture.

IT is necessary for a Refiner to have his Copels made well, because if the Copels Copels of good staff.be not made of good Loam or Clay they will devour the fine Metal very much, especially when the Clar is not well made which is to be put upon the Copel, because it will rise, and so the silver Grain will be hid under it, and if the Clar be not good, the silver Grain will be lost under the Lead and not fined. Also, if the Ashes be not good, or something fat or oyly, then will the Copels melt in the fire, which will prove of ill Consequence, because with such there can be no Tryall made. Page 19  But, that you may have good Copels, that your Tryals may be the better perform'd, make them in this following Manner.  Of Ashes for Copils.Take Ashes burnt from any light Wood, (as Sallows, &c. for such are best for this use) and put them into a Seeve, and pour Water on them that the Ashes may be wash'd through the Seeve into a Tub, so the Coals and grosser parts may remain in the Seeve, then pour into the Tub so much water more, that the Ashes may be covered-over, then stirr it about, and let it stand an hour or two: whereby the water will draw out the fatness and oilyness out of the Ashes, then pour the remaining water very gently off, that the thick troubled water may not go along with the clear water; and then pour another water on it, and let it stand also till the upper water grow clear; then pour it again gently off, and this do till the water hath no fatness or sharpness: then the third time pour clear water on the Ashes and stir them about with a stick, as before, and pour that water, whilst it is thick and muddy, into another Tub, that the gross part of the Ashes in the first may remain till the water in the other Tub be clear and well setled; then let the water run clear from it again, this is the first clearing: then pour another water upon the wash'd settled Ashes, and stir them again with a stick, then pour the thick again into another Tub or Boul, that is to try if there remains any Fatness or gross Ashes, that it may all be cleanly separated, and let the muddy water settle very well because it is the last washing: and when the Ashes are thus far prepared, then make Balls thereof, let them dry well in the Sun, or in a Bakers Oven, and keep them clean for use.  Of Vinewood ashes and common Ashes.There are some Refiners that in stead of Ashes (burnt off light Wood) do take Ashes of Vine-wood, Image 33 (page 20)  (but they are not every-where to be had) and they do wash and prepare them as abovesaid, some do use only such Ashes of which the common Lixivium or Lye is made, but the two former are better, which you will also finde by use and Experience, only there must be a care that the Ashes be clear and well prepared.  Secondly, You must have to your Copels good Of Bone-ashes, and which Bones are most serviceable.and clean Bone-Ashes, for which take Bones that have no Marrow or Gravy, and burn them white, pulverize, and pass them through a hair Seeve, then grinde them upon a stone, like Meal, and so you have Bone-Ashes prepared: then take two parts of the wash'd Ashes which have first past through the hair Seeve, that they may not remain in Lumps; and with one part of the ground Bone-Ashes, and mingle these two well together, and moisten them with strong-Beer (but first let the Beer boil away one third) or, with a Glew-water: But, if you will bestow somthing more upon it, then beat the whites of Eggs in water, and moisten the Ashes therewith, but not too much, that when you press a handful together, the Ash-ball may well remain intire: then let the Copel-case be well fill'd with Ashes and put in, but be sure to scrape the superfluous Ashes off it, Munich.and give the Monk three or four blows vvith a wooden Mallet upon the Copel-frame, wipe the Monk clean off, and strew (with a little wooden shovel) good Clar upon the Copel, vvhile 'tis yet in the Case, and part the Clar, vvith your finger, and set the Monk strait upon it again, and give tvvo or three Blovvs to fasten the Clar upon the Copel (as necessity doth require) that the Clar may be fixed upon it, then take the Monk off, press upon other Ashes the Copel out of the Case, so is the Copel ready; in such a manner may you make Copels great and small, then let them dry till you have need of them, so vvill they be firm and good. Page 21 Some do use a special Instrument made of Latten   which is full of little holes at the bottom, in which they put the Clar, and with a wyer that hath underneath a An Instrument to strew the Clar.little cross-Plate, they cause it to run through, but I do not like it so well, as if it were parted with the finger. Some do take also among the Copel-Ashes the tenth  Of Glew for Copels.part of good Potters-Loam (which must also be wash'd like unto the Copel-Ashes) and dry it in the Sun, and this is necessary to be used with it, and when the Clay is good and holds well in the fire: otherwise it may do more hurt than good in the Copels, and I conclude, when a man hath good Ashes that are well washed (as I have hinted before) good Copels may be made that need no mixture, and those Ashes may well be moistned with fair water, but the Copels are more brickle by it, and not so firm, as with the strong Beer or glew-water.   CHAP. VI. How good Copels may be made, wherein the Tryals will not leap nor sparkle. SUCH Copels as I have hitherto thought  fit to mention, are good to be used, by vvhich the true quantity and proof may be found in them, vvhen the Governance of the Fire is vvell observed, but if this be not minded, and the Copel be cool and hot, then some part of the Silver is soon lost, but if an Assayer is uncertain in the Silver and Money-proofs, and hath not a full knovvledg of the Fire, it is better for him to cause the following Copels be made for Tryals.  Let Knuckle-Bones, or other Bones be burnt very Bones for Copels. Image 34 (page 22)  white (the Calves or Sheeps-bones are best) among common Bones) stamp them fine, and grind them upon a Grind stone fine as flower, then mosten such subtile bone-ashes (like other Copel-Ashes) with strong Beer, and of this make Copels, and strew Clar on them, as hath been done with the other before named Copels, and let them dry; so are they prepared.  But good and clean Bones of Fishes may be had, (which of all Bone-Ashes are the best to be used for Copels.) When you would assay upon these Copels, set them in the Proof-Oven, and when they are only glowing hot, then put what you do intend to try in then, and although they are only thus, the Proofs vvill not leap, but be purely finished: only this is to be noted, that the Assayes upon these Copels are much colder, longer and go more subtilly than upon the other Copels, therefore there cannot easily any thing of Silver be lost; and vvhen the proof is finished than may the Grain be taken off very pure and clean, and nothing stick to it, although it had been a Coppery-Silver that vvas refined in it, vvhich Grains do commonly enter into the Clar, and they cannot alvvays be taken off cleanly from other Copels.   Page 23 CHAP. VII. How good Clar is to be made.  IT is necessary that good Clar must be had for the making of Copells, because if the same be not good, then there can be no good Copels made, although the Ashes be prepared as vvell as can be. Novv (as for my part) I have vvith Diligence try'd many Bones, and have found that Calve's-head Bones or the Scales that come from their Forehead are the best: Take them and wash them from a boiling hot water, or let them boil well in the water, that the fatness and foulness may be separated from the other, then dry them and burn them untill they be fair and white, then stamp and grind them on a stone, still moistning them with a little water, and put them in a glaz'd Pot with a Cover luted on it, and set them once more in a fire or Potters-Oven, and let them burn well for four hours, then let them cool; this done, take these burnt Ashes out of the Pot, and grind them once more very fine upon a smooth (or Marble) stone, that they may be very clear (of which clear preparation, the Clar hath its Appellation or name) keep it from Dust, and it will serve for your use at any time.  Some also do use Harts-horn to make Clar, and they Clar of Harts hornburn it and order it as the other abovesaid, and this doth yield good Clar, but those of the Scales of Calves-heads I like better.  There is also of Fish-bones (as Pike and other Fishes Of Fishbone.Bones) very good Clar to be made, but the Fatness Image 35 (page 24)  must be first separated from it, by boyling and burning them (as before) but this according to ones pleasure, and which Clar any one likes best, he may use, only he must be careful to see that they be finely ground to Pouder.  When the Clar is ground to pouder, then some do How to be kept.wash it in fair water, and make four-square Pieces of it, or Balls (like Chalk-stone) as I my self did some years since, but I find that if it be finely ground, and dryed only, it is the better, because by washing and drying it, and making them into pieces or Balls, they will grow hard, and cannot be so well scraped from the Lumps, as with that which is in Pouder. Now, how the Copel-Case and the Copel is to be ordered and performed the following Sculpture will shew.  Sculpture V.  Page 25 Deciphered. 1. 3. The Copel-cases.  2. 4.

CHAP. VIII. How Glass of Lead, or Lead-Glass is to be made.  FURTHER, that every one may have good and fundamental Information of what belongs to Assayes, therefore I do intend, before I further proceed, to shew Lead-glass to what Oars it is to be used.how the Fluss, or lead Glass must be prepared, which lead Glass is a Fluss, and is used to the very hardest and unflowing Oars, to the end that they may as easily be boiled up as the soft Oars: of which boyling, hereafter shall follow more full Direction.  To prepare Flus or lead-glass.Prepare this Fluss or Lead-glass, thus, Take fair and white pibble-stones, burn them in a Potters-Oven, stamp them small, and pass it through an hair Seeve, pour clean water on it, and wash the Mud from it, that the pouder of the pibble-stones may be clean and pure: of these pibble stones take one part, and half a part of red Littorage or Littarge, mingle it dry together, put it into a Crucible, but not above two thirds full, and put common Salt on the top of it, or Salt-peter (if such can be had) about three Fingers height above the matter, and lute it well; and let it flow together with a strong heat in a Wind-Oven or Tyle-Oven; let the Crucible cool of it self, then open it, and all will be mingled in a yellow Glass; only a little Regulus of Lead at the Bottom, which is to be Page 27 separated, but preserve the Glass, which is the Fluss.   You may also melt the Littarge first by it self, and of the slakes that come from it, take ten parts to one Another way.part of prepared pibble-stones, and cover it with Salt, (as above) cause them to flow, and so a good Lead-glass will come of it.  Another way.Or take instead os the wash'd Pibbles, good wash'd Loam, which is dry and firmly pulverized, one part, and three parts of good red Littarge, cover it with Salt, let it flow in a strong heat, this doth yield a fair Lead glass.  To cleanse the Leadglass.When the Lead-glass is made, and again melted in a Crucible, put a little Niter in it, and cause it to flow a while after, so the Lead-glass will become cleaner or more flowing: or one may use among it a fourth part of Caput Mort� and cause them to flow together, this also causes the Fluss to become finer and more flowing.   CHAP. IX. Of the Weights which belong to the proving of Silver-Oars.  THE Centner-weight by which all Oars, Slicks or wash'd slake-stones and what else of this nature are prov'd) is by the old Assayers proportioned thus: That the Centner is orderd to be just an Hundred pound weight: for this Reason, because in many places the Oars or slake-stones, and the silvery unwash'd black Copper is bought by weight, and the fine Silver in it according to the Proof (before it is melted out of it) is paid for this end, that the Buyer may not be a Looser (because of the waste in melting Image 37 (page 28)  to get out the Silver) therefore hath he so many pounds as the Common Centner of the Mine yields (or where it doth weigh more or above) which Centner of the Mynt doth commonly weigh an Hundred and ten pounds, so that he may have the ten Pounds that is above, with the Silver in it, to help to bear the loss) therefore in a well ordered melting of poor Oars they do hold most commonly 3, 4, or 5 loth of Silver, for the loss of the Silver in Melting should not be above the Silver contained in the ten Pounds of the Oar, that was over, comparing it with the proof-Centner: but in rich work and rich Oars, or concerning very rich Copper, the ten pounds which are above are also justly taken along with it.    1 Dram.   Of dividing the common Proof Centner. 1 �   2 Drams or half a Loth.     1 Loth or two Ounces.   2   4   8   16     1 �   2   4   8   16 A Pound.   25 A quarter of a Centner.   50 Half a Centner.   100 A whole Centner.    Two sorts of Penny weights.The Peny-weights are of two sorts, the one is with us in High Germany, the other is as 'tis used in Holland, after which the Silver or Grains may be tryed, upon a Page 29 just proportion how much a Mark hath in it of fine  Silver.   1 Heller, or Half-penny.  Of dividing the Penny-weight in High Germany.   1 �     1 Pence.   2 �     1 Drams.   2     1 Loth, or, 4 half Ounces.   2   4   8   16 Loth is a Mark, or 256 pence.      � Of dividing the Low Dutch Peny Weight. The single Grains.   �   1   2   3 �   6 �   12 Grains is a Half penny.     1 �   2 Pence.   3 �   6 Pence is a Mark, or 288 Grains.   12 There are so much as 256 pence.   The Mark in the Grain-weight, is parted into Loths and Grains, like as the Low Dutch Peny-weight is parted into Loths, Pence and Grains, and this Weight is most commonly used for Tryals in the Crucible for Coyn'd Mony, to which it doth best serve: for this Reason, because Image 38 (page 30)  the Grains here are reduced into greater Numbers, and the Contents more exactly found out, because in the Peny-weight it is only parted into Pence, and Half-Pence, and although the fourth part of a Grain (as to its Contents) is not usually reckoned, yet it is necessary for an Assayer to have such a fourth part in his parting or sharing for Information and Exactness sake,   � Single Grains.   �   �     1 Grains is half a Loth.   2   3   6   9     1   2   4 Loth, or two Ounces.   8   16 Loth is a Mark, or 288 Grains.     CHAP. X. How all Silver-Oars are to be tryed.  I HAVE mentioned before, That a difference is to be made among Oars, because Assaying of soft flowing Oars.some are harsh, hard-flowing and raw; as also that some are soft-flowing and mild: The soft-flowing Oars are thus to be tryed for Silver: Take the Oar, grind it with an Hammer upon a broad Iron, Page 31 (fitted to that purpose) as small as pouder, weigh of it a   Centner (with thy Assay-weight) put it on a well-made Test, and mingle eight times as much of Lead in Grains among it, and set in a warm Assay-Oven, and presently make it hot, and set Coles before the Ovens mouth, so the Lead will begin to drive and turn quickly to Slacke or Dross, and when it hath stood so long in the Proof-Oven, that the Lead upon the Test is all covered over with dross, then it hath dross enough; (this is called Boyling up or �p-boyling) then take an Iron hook, lay it that it may be a little red hot, and stir the Oar with it cleanly about, which is done for this Reason, that if there should stick any of the Oar on the sides of the Test, it may be made loose, and that the Lead also may work on it, and consume it: After the stirring, let it stand a while, and then take it out of the Assay-Oven, and pour the Lead and dross upon an Iron-plate, in one of the little holes that are to be made upon the Plate, and let it cool, and then separate the dross clean from the Lead, so is the proof of the �pboyling ready, which is done in the space of about half an hour, afterwards set Coppels in the Assay Oven, and let them glow well for half an hour, (and this is called Nealing) and upon these well neal�d Coppels put your Lead so wrought, which hath been boiled up, and make it warm that the same may first begin to work, and when it begins to drive, then keep the fire not too high, that the Lead or work may drive well, and go off upon the Coppel in a conveient heat, and so the Lead will all be drawn into the Coppel, and the grain of Silver will remain alone, (provided that the Oar hath Silver in it) upon the Coppel, although it be very small, then take the Coppel out of the Assay-Oven, and take with your Pincers the Grain from it, so is the proof finished: Now, how this Grain is to be weighed, with the Assay-Scales, it doth require a special diligence; Image 39 (page 32)  and of this you shall be more exactly instructed afterwards.  You shall Assay these harsh and hard flowing Oars in Tryals of harsh Oars.this manner, Take the Oar ground small, and weigh of it a Centner with your Assay-weight, put it on a good Test, and add to it its due weight of Lead, to wit, Fourteen Centners: set it in an Assay-Oven, and give it presently heat, that the Lead in the Assay-Test may begin to drive, as you have done with the soft-flowing Oars, and when the Lead begins to drive, then let it be cold again, which will be, when you do shut the lower mouthhole, and do open the upper, then will the Oar rise, and come to be roasted upon the Lead; when it is roasted enough upon the Lead (that is when it is seen to leave smoaking much and begins to slacke) then maist thou give it heat again, as much as can be. This happens when you do lay Coals before the upper Mouth-hole of the Assay-Oven, so the great heat will force it, that the Oar will turn to slackes, but it doth slacke small and not easily, and when the Oar is almost boyled up, and hath slacked finely, then stir it cleanly with an Iron-hook, let it stand again a pretty while in the Oven, and when all is turn'd to fine slakes, then pour it as before upon a Plate hollowed, or let it cool in the Test, and beat the slackes from it, so is the proof of up-boyling ready.  A quick upboyling of Silver OarsIn such manner, almost, may all Pibbles or raw Oar be boyled up, and this is a right and good way to do it, but the up-boyling is hardly done in an hour, yet it may be done sooner in this manner; when you have weighed your Oar, and set it on the Test without Lead in the Assay-Oven, give first some heat until the oar upon the Test is roasted, and smoak no more: then set the Lead, (as much as belongs to the Tryal) upon the Test; give it a great heat, so will the Oar boyl up something easier, and in less time than if it should have been roasted upon the Lead. Page 33  Although there are some that believe such a Tryal in which the Oar also is roasted without Lead) is false and not right, yet I do give this Information, That I have oftentimes, (with one sort or other) tryed both wayes, and I do truly affirm, That I have found no difference: But there must be a Care taken, that when the Oar is set alone upon the Test, that it may not be put into a violent suddain heat, because such an heat doth raise the small Oar, and doth cause it to dust away, especially when the Oars are stony, for it makes the Tryal false (this excepted) I know no fault, but be carefull and you will find it true.  Another way to try raw Oar.Some have also another way to try raw mild Oar; as thus, They set first the Test in the Oven, that it may glow, and then put the Lead in it, and let it by it self slack pretty well, after that put upon the slack'd Lead, the weighed Oar in small Papers, so the hot Lead, and hot Slack will draw the Oar quickly to it self, and will not let it rise much, or boil up very well: this way I also like, only that in drawing the Oar upon the hot Lead, (especially the mild Oars) it will dust, and when there are many Proofs to be made together, there will something be neglected, and the Proofs may become false.  If one doth know the Nature and Property of such Oars as will not easily boil or slack, but remain upon the Lead (for so will the Chalk-stones) the gross and raw blind or Cobolt, the mispeckle, as also the mild and fresh Pibbles and water-pibbles which must (assoonas they are weighed) be mingled with Flus or Lead-glass (as hath been before mentioned) which vvill hold the raw Oar, and doth not suffer it to rise high, because it hath help by the Lead-glass, so that it vvill become soft Slacks and slacks vvell, and boyls up clean, as may be seen in melting: harsh Oars (vvhich in �p-boyling each one by his proper addition may be helped) that they vvill be vvell Image 40 (page 34)  separated, or else there vvill remain some Silver in the slacks, and so there vvould be some Dammage.  Of Assaying the Copper slacky Oar.In S. Joakims Valley (so called) there are Oars broken, vvhich are called Coppery-Oars or flaky Oars, vvhen they are once boyled up, the Work or lead vvill not go off upon the Coppel, but casts up a Ring or border, and eats much in, and makes the Proof false: and vvhen this is knovvn by an Oar, then must the vvork or Lead vvhich hath been boyled up (and from vvhich the dross is separated) be again set upon the Test, and be slack'd again, and then the Lead vvill come off clean and white; This is called, the Lead cleansed of its Foulness, then it must go off upon the Coppel, as before.  Cleansing of the gross sulphury Flints after �pboyling.It happens also often, that the gross Sulphury oars do also make the Lead black and harsh, also that upon a well neal'd Coppel it doth not drive, but leap off, which makes the Tryals oftentimes come false, because of its Foulness, such Lead you must once more set upon a new Test or upon the same, and let it slacke again, so will it be white and clean and go well off upon the Coppel, and loose nothing.  To try Cobolt Oars.Concerning the Cobolt oars, there are many sorts of them, some fresh and some milde, black and gray, some in trying do go easily into the Lead, but such Lead that comes by �p-boyling from it, is black and red, and it afterwards doth work upon the Coppel, and dissolves, therefore it must after the first �p-boyling, be cleansed again of its Wildness and must be slackd once more, so it will become white, and go clean off from the Coppel: One may also set the weightiest Cobolt Oar in a Test in the Oven, and let the smoak pass away, some of which sort do leave gray Ashes, and some a black grain upon the Test, and the rest will burn all away, but put a little Lead to it, and it will easily go in it, and also go Page 35 clean off from the Coppel, and is found alike with the  other Tryals.  But some do take it as above-mentioned, That when the raw oar upon the Test is roasted without Lead, the Roasting Oar in the Ovens.roasting doth take away some of the Silver, and that the gross Sulphur doth carry it away, and they will demonstrate it by some volatile raw Flints, and the raw slackestone, which comes from it; which after they are roasted do not yield so much Silver as if they were melted raw through the Furnace, to which I do yield, and have found the same true: But because the roasting generally in the great Work with quantities of oars is done in the naked fire, in which it also must lye several hours� contrariwise in the Assay-oven and small Proofs there is but little oar put in, and that in a close Fire is roasted in a short time, I judg for certain, that through such roasting of the Oars in the Assay oven, nothing can be lost of the Silver.  Probation by which the right and full worth may be found.Some may ask, If this way of using, trying and boyling up of Oars in the Test (and to let them so go off in the Test) be the right way, or no, by which the true worth, and how much Silver the Oar contains in it may be known? To which I answer, That this is the right proving, after which the melting Works may be ordered, and set up: But the true worth, how much Silver the Oar hath in it, is not found there. But to know this, Set a great Coppel (as is used to Copper Assayes for Silver) in the Assay-oven, and neal it well, and put sixteen Centners of Lead in it, let it begin to drive, then put one Centner of the ground-oar, which must be parted into many parts, and put it in small Papers, one after another, when the one part doth come first on it, it will seem stubborn upon the Lead, and vvill cover it all over, but let not this hinder thee; Do it first a little cool, and then hot, so it vvill soon slack in the Image 41 (page 36)  Coppel, and the slacks vvill pass avvay, then set an other part of the Oar on the Lead, and that vvill do like the first, vvhich slackes vvill soon pass avvay, then put in like manner the Oar all singly upon the Lead, and it vvill all pass clean avvay in the Coppel, so that it vvill hardly be discerned, but seem like any other vvork upon the Coppel. In this manner may all other Works (if they be flowing or harsh, as also melted slack stone and Copper stone) be tryed through; in vvhich you vvill finde a great difference, if you try the other usual Way of Refining, but this vvay cannot be used generally, except of all Oars that are melted, to slacks vvhich are not altogether without Silver; therefore the common way of Assaying (with the �p-boyling upon Tests, of which all slacks do come, which cannot be wholly without Silver) is the best way: I have only mentioned these Assayes, to demonstrate, That with the same (out of every Oar) the right and full worth of Silver may be found in it, as fully as in the other Common Assayes: For several years, some vvorthy Assayers have weighed the Oars with the Centner-weight,  To try with Lead glass.which they intended to try upon silver Proofs mingled with Lead-glass, and covered with Salt in a Crucible, and placed it before the Bellows, and did melt it into a Regulus, after which when the Crucible vvas cold, then have they beaten out the Regulus, and together vvith the slackes have set it again upon a Test in an Assay-Oven, and caused it to slack fully, vvhich vvay is nothing vvorth, especially vvhen many Oar-Proofs are to be made: then Refiners have soon seen it, and have  When many Oars are�to be tryed.thereupon ordered their Tryals according to our vvay. Here I must mention also, That vvhen an Assayer hath dayly much to try (to vvhose hands vvithout Question harsh and hard�flowing Oars come often) and if he be then vvell skill'd he knoweth by much and daily Page 37 Experience and Practice) how each Oar is in the  Tryal; therefore when he hath prepared the Oar for Assaying (and so he must because of the many sorts) use a bigger Assay-oven, that he may set several Proofs together at Work, whereby his Tryals may be made the sooner, and must keep this Order, when he will set his Assays in the Oven, if they be 8, 9, or more, he must place them accordingly upon the Assayes, which are prepared in this manner; viz. That always the hard-flowing Oars may be hindmost in the Oven, and that the soft-flowing may stand before: for they are soonest boiled up, and so may be taken out of the Oven without hindrance to those that must be longest in the fire, and then be cast upon an Iron-plate, vvhich Plate must be made thus, It must have as many Holes and Vents as there are Tests to be set in the oven at once: so that each Oar may be poured out from its ovvn hole, that you may not mistake: But if it should happen that (because of thy many Tryals) you must have above one Furnace, then put all the hard-flowing Oars into one Furnace, and the soft-flowing into the other; othervvise you must stay one Tryal for the other, which would be an hinderance. This vvay of Assaying is at Kuttingburgh (because of the great Oar-Trade in common use there) so that in some places every Week 200 Tryals of Oars are made, and the Contents are delivered to a Dram.  To assay to a Dram�Take Notice, That it is vvith this, as vvith other Tryals, (as was before mentioned) only have a Care that you make use of an Assay-weight which may not be too little, and to have good and quick Scales upon which you may know the weight to a dram, or the fourth part of an Ounce, so then if you do well with the Proof in the Fire, then may you safely and surely give in the true Contents of as many Loths and Drams as you do find, after that one is weighed. Image 42 (page 38)  Further, take Notice, That when thy Tryal is made and that you will draw up or weigh your small proofgrains, How to weigh the tryd grain.let your Scales be kept in a Case of Glass (that the same may be preserv'd from the Wind and Dust) then put into the one Scale the small grain of Silver, and into the other the grain of Lead (as small as it is) and put as much of the Assay-weight to it, that it may stand even with the grain in the other Scale, when this is done, then change the Scales that are in the Proof-scales, and see if the Scales stand even as before, if then the Proof be found alike on the one side as on the other, and just with the weight, then may the same be judged true, and be given in.  To boil rich Oar with Fluss.Such silver Oars as are very rich may also with the Fluss (made of Salt-petar and Argol asshall follow hereafter) be mingled and put into a Crucible and covered over with Salt, and may be melted like unto the Copper Oars before the Bellows, and there will be a silver Regulus, in the bottom of the Crucible (which is not very tuff nor pure, because of other incorporated Metals) the which you may make fully tuff upon a Test, and in this manner the silver is very easily to be had out, but it is not the true Contents, because the Slacks do yet contain part of the Silver in them, the grain also doth not come very fine from the Test except it be done upon the Coppel.   Page 39 CHAP. XI. How poor Oars of Silver are to be Assayed.  AS for poor and unclean silver Oars which are mingled with stones (and yet may be wash'd off with water) Assay them thus; stamp and grind them in an Iron Morter very fine (like flower) mingle all well together; and weigh 28 Centners of it with the Assay weights, then put it into a smooth Tub, wash it with water till it remain like a fine slick or Clay, then weigh this wet slick and you will find how much those Oars do weigh and afford of clean slick, in one Center (because the slicks that are made clean by washing are also weiged vvet) try it upon silver (as you have been taught above) after such a Proof you may make your Accounts: and if by preparing and vvorking thus you can subsist: such a Proof hath preserved many an Assayer from danger of loss.   CHAP. XII. To try Muddy-vvater springs of Silver.  SOMETIMES it comes to pass that from mild silver Veins, there springs out of the Mountain a blackish or yellowish muddy water, which doth often contain Silver: this you must try thus, Take a Potfull of this Water, boil it that there Image 43 (page 40)  may remain a slime or settlement, weigh this, and do with it as with other Silver Oar, so will you finde what it contains.   CHAP. XIII. How a true Lead-Grain which is usually drawn off in the Proof, is to be made.  EVERY Assayer hath need to have great Care of the Lead-grain which he may make of the Lead that he uses dayly more than one grain, that he may be certain, because all Lead, almost, doth contain Silver, and although the Lead of Villach is counted the best for to assay withall, yet there is but little to be found of it that is quite without Silver.  So then there is no grounding upon this, because The Lead of Villach not without Silver.unexpert Assayers that do run off upon the Copel four Centners of Lead, and vvhen they find no Silver therein, do therefore conclude that there is no Silver in the Lead, but there is need to run off so much Lead upon the Coppel, as much as is required to every Assay, and to try it more than once, and if then there is found nothing in all this, then may it be concluded, That the Lead holds no Silver, and yet one is not to rely altogether upon it, but an Assayer is to prove his Lead several times over and over, again: that if a piece or lump should differ one from another (because the Pieces of Lead are not all cast at once in the smelting House where it is made) that he may be certain of his Lead, which is of much concernment: and so you will finde that also the Page 41 Villach-Lead doth leave a grain of Silver when the full  weight of Lead is assayed, which silver-grain is to be laid upon the Scales with the Assay-weight, that it may be abated from the other Grain of Silver which came from the Proof-Oar.  Further some Assayers are of the mind, That if there is a little Copper added that holds no Silver at all, and The Lead-grain with the Addition of Copper.doth cause it to go off on the Coppel, that then the Lead-grain is found the better: this is well, if one desires to try Copper upon Silver, and so to make the Lead-grain; but to Oar-proofs, and to other things which are not Coppery such a Lead-grain must not be used.  To make another Lead grain�Because all Oar-Tryals do slack in the proving such as are very rich of Lead, and yet do afford some Silver: the Opinion of some is, to take the weight of Lead, and a Centner of Earth of the Mine or common Oar which hath little or no silver, and boyl them up together, that they may turn to slacks, as is done with the Oar-Tryals; then the slacks will draw in part of the Lead grain, which is to be counted for a true Lead-grain for use. But I judge because the Lead grain is otherwise poor, that the Difference herein is not great, yet it is left to every ones pleasure to make use of his own way.   CHAP. XIV. How a Slackstone or Copper-stone is to be made, and to be tryed for Silver, and what the Slackstone is.  What Slackstone is.SLACKSTONES (as the Philosophers do judg) are Sulphur and Arsnick mingled vvith a subtil Earth, and doth separate in fusion from the Dross, and doth draw the Copper and Silver to it self, demonstrated thus; The Brimstone in the Image 44 (page 42)  beginning doth roast away, and the Arsnick doth sublime it self with a strong heat, but the Earth in which the Silver is and the Copper doth remain, which is afterwards easily brought to slacks, that the Metal may be separated, which otherwise could not be if the Arsnick had been with it, from hence may be known how to draw the Silver and Copper out of the Slackstone, so can it be no otherwise than to separate the Sulphur and Arsnick first from it, which is done by roasting, as may be seen in the great works of Smelting; thus, that the Slackstone in the beginning may have but small heat (and not a strong fire) so that the  To separate it from Sulphur.cold Air may easily fall upon it, and cause the venomous Sulphur to rise, (which doth fly from cold, and loves the heat) and so doth easily separate, which otherwise doth stay in a violent heat, and remains alwayes Slack stone, and is afterwards not so easily separated, yet a small heat only doth it not, therefore in roasting, the fire must be increased by degrees, and in the End, when the Sulphur is almost roasted away from the Slack stone, then with a strong fire the remaining Sulphur and Arsnick must be driven away, although the roast should flow with it, yet it is no hurt to it: I do write this, That it may be seen, that the Searchers of Nature, have also with Diligence searched into these things, and that Roasting hath had its rise from thence.  Which way the Cakes are to be knock'd out.When the Red Slacks or Copper-stones are prepared and the Cakes set upon one another, and you are willing to try them for Silver, then beat out of every Cake a piece, not quite in the middle nor quite at the end, which is the best for proof (because the Silver runs toward the Cold) so that the stone-Cakes are found richer at the end than in the midst:) Take all the pieces that are cut out, mingle them together, and make a Page 43 proof of it (this is called Younger proof) which you  may grind very small, and weigh of it a Centner with thy Assay-weight, and assay such a Stone (as you have been taught above) and as hath been done with the harsh Oars, put presently its due of Lead to it, and let it first roast off upon the same. In the end give it good heat, that the proof may be boyled up; But because this Proof is of much Concernment, therefore take sixteen weight of Lead, that the Tryal may have enough, because for a Tryal it is better to have the weights of Lead too much than too little.   CHAP. XV. To try Hard Work and Copper-Laech upon Silver.  DRY and fat hard Work or Copper Laech some Founders (especially them of Cuttenberg) Two Sorts of Hard Work.do use for an Addition to work the silvery Oars into slacks, that such Addition may be rich in Copper, and that fresh Cakes may be cast, and the Silver separated, to which in Comparison to common Refining, there belongs a particular Account and Understanding, for such dry and fat Hard Work must be tryed for Silver, like unto a Leadish black Copper (which is almost one thing) and of which there will soon follow Direction.   Image 45 (page 44) CHAP. XVI. To Assay melted Speiz, and what it is.  THE Spiez Oar is in many places (especially in Joakim's Valley) and is found What Speiz is.out in melting: the Philosophers do think that it consists of Arsnick and Brimstone mingled with a subtil Earth, vvhich doth separate it self from the slacks, like unto the Copper slack stones, only in the Spiez Oar and the slack stone there is this Difference: For, as the Brimstone doth surpass (as abovesaid) the Arsnick, so in the Spiezy Oar the Arsnick surpasseth the Brimstone: therefore the Speiz is vvhiter than the Slackstone, and doth loose but little either in the strong, or small fire, nor by roasting; nor can it be overcome by Lead, but is always found again, and doth loose but little; only this is necessary to be known, that when the Speize is melted in the flintish-Lead Oar gently, and not  To take the Silver out of Speize.over-heated, and doth then mingle with the slacks of Iron and (according to the manner of the City of Goslar) doth melt among the light Dust, so comes the Speiz to be lost, and none of it is found again, and the Silver enters into the Lead, which is caused by the Antimony in the Lead-oar, and the red Sulphur in the Flints: which are both again in the Arsnick. But when there is a desire to Assay the Speiz for Silver, you must grind it small, and weigh it, and with so much Lead (as a slackstone hath need of) set it on a Test in an Assay oven, and in the beginning a great Grain of speiz vvill be found svvimming upon the Lead, vvhich cannot be consumed Page 45 by it, some Refiners do take this Grain with Pincers  out of the Lead, and although the silver of the speiz doth enter into the Lead, yet without question such Grain doth contain some silver: But that the full Contents thereof may be found out, Leave the Grain on the Test, and add to the speiz on the Test, some filings of Iron, that hath no silver, and then the speiz will be quite consumed, and become dross or slacks.   CHAP. XVII. How Black Copper is to be melted and cast into Ingots.  THERE are many sorts of Black Copper, one part is very good, but others unclean Difference of the Black Coppers.and harsh, as Iron-slacky, leadish, speizy, and also sometimes tinny, according as a Copper Oar doth break by another metallick Oar, or, if any of them hath veins through the Copper Oars, such a Metal comes to be mingled with the Copper, and is the worse for it.  So then, if you will cut out such black Copper and will cast an Ingot of it, Take of the Cakes which have been How black Copper is to be cut out.made upon the roast at once into Copper, cut a small piece of every Cake above and under, and not quite in the middle, nor at the end, according to proportion and bigness of the Cake; and here you must be careful that you do not cut a small piece out of a great Cake, nor a great piece out of a small Cake, because one Cake contains more silver than the other, and so a Proof may be soon made false.  How the Proof-Ingot is to be cast.When the Cakes are all cut out, then put all the pieces Image 46 (page 46)  into a Crucible, melt them before the Bellows together, and when the Copper begins to flow and drive, then stir it about with a dry splinter or stick, and let it stand a little longer, then take a clean Ingot rub'd with a little tallow, and cast the Copper into it, all at once, that nothing remain in the Crucible, but set the Ingot smooth, that the Copper may be no thicker at one end than the other, because where the Ingot doth hang, the Copper runs that way, and is richer there in silver, especially in rich Copper. You must also quench in water the cast Ingot, if the Copper hath not been leady or tinny, and with a hard Charcoal the tallow may be scoured off, and the Ingot cleansed, but the Lead and Coppery cast Ingot must be left cooling in the Ingot, that the Lead may not rise up, so is the Ingot finished, which is to be cut halfthrough the Ingot, and beat it cross vvay, then vvith a Hammer and Chisel strike it into two, so in the breadth the goodness of the Copper may be seen, and how the Ingot hath been together: and one half is to be given to the Buyer, and the other to the Seller, that if there should be an Error in the Proof then the Ingot might be assayed again.  It is also necessary to know, that if the Copper doth Difference of the Proof Ingot.drive too long in the Crucible, it doth waste and become richer in the Contents, which is easily to be seen, besides, if the Ingot be cast too hot, it will be in some places full of little holes, also if it is not all over smooth, but wrinkly and with knots, then it is cast too cold, so it is not found alike in Contents: if any of this happens in Casting by negligence, then such an Ingot is to be done away, and the Copper Cakes again cut out, to cast another Ingot, and thereby you will fine the right proof, and contents; because if the first should be melted and cast again, then it must drive again in the Crucible, and Page 47 the Copper would waste more, so the Contents would be  richer, and the Tryal false.  If you intend to assay such, Cast Copper Ingots for silver: Cut (with a Chissel) at the end of the Ingot a Assaying the Ingot.little piece, put that away and cut another, beat it flat upon a clean Anvil, or, if tis brittle, then to small bits, which you may weigh and assay thus: weigh of such pieces equally two Centners, put each in a small paper by it self, make it so that it may lye flat in the papers, and not in heaps, put also two great well-made and well neal'd Coppels in the Assay-oven, in the middle under the Muffle, and in each sixteen Centners of good clean Lead: but before all this, make a flame in the Oven with a Copper pipe, and the Oven and Coppel must be clean that no Ashes may remain in it, make it at the beginning warm, and when it begins to glow, and when the Lead doth go upon the Coppel, and doth not leap; then put the weighed Copper upon it; make it hot again untill it begins to melt or to go fresh. After this open the upper Mouth-hole, and shut the lower, cover the Oven with a Cover, yet not quite close, but that it may remain open about an inch wide, or as necessity doth require; Afterwards set behind (and upon the sides of the Muffle) the little Instruments, so the Copper will soon begin to go, then let it have a requisite Coldness (because the Copper among other Metals (try'd for silver) can endure the most cold. And after it hath gone a while cold, then lay before the upper Mouth-hole a few live coals that do not sparkle, or, if you do make your tryal in the Furnace made of Armour-plate, as in Sculpture Ill. Figure 9. then put before the upper Ovens-mouth the little plate full of holes, and govern the fire with such live Coals on the plate with holes, or by moving the Cover above, that the tryal may be hotter and hotter untill the end, then take the Cover Image 47 (page 48)  quite from the Oven, and cause the Grain of Silver to be all over bright and clean from spots, because the Copper Assay and government of the fire is of much concernment, The Regiment of the fire.and is accounted so, because it is necessary to know how to give heat and cold (as it requires) if the same be duly perform'd) but if it is not so, and that the tryal be too hot, then there will be an ounce of Silver less in a Centner of rich Copper, and the Contents will be found so much poorer, but because such a Knowledg and Government of the fire cannot be described, but is learned only out of much Experience, therefore do I rest here: But yet know thus much, that if the Proof on the Coppel doth grow high and clear, then it is hot, but if it doth go flat and darkish, then doth it go cold; There must in the Copper Assay in all Tryals, the middle way is to be observ'd, and the true contents will be found: although young Assayers do much esteem their own Works, and do slight knowledg of the fire, yet it is certain, as the Copper for silver by such means is right assayed, so must it be done with all other Copper Tryals, and he that is well acquainted with such Copper proof in the fire, he will want nothing in other Tryals, as hath been said.  Of the Grain produced from the Assay.Thus, when the Grains of such two tryals have twinkled, fresh and clean, then take the Coppel out of the Oven, and take the Grains off, while the Coppel is yet hot, so they will part clean from the clear, and the Coppels which bring the yellow subtil Littarge alwayes vvith it. Provided it hath had its due Heats and Colds (as hath been said before) but if it hath had too great heats then there vvill be no Littarge and it is not good to trust to such Tryals, but vvhen the two Assay Grains in the drawing up of the Scales are of a like vveight, then is it a sign that the proof hath been well made, but if they differ, although the Tryals have been diligently Page 49 performed, yet there is no certainty to ground upon it,  and it is better that such be made anew; but forget not vvhen you do intend to dravv up the Proof vvith thy vveight, to put it in the scales vvith thy vveight lead grain of the Assay lead, and to beat it off from thy proof grains, although it be very small.  Another way to try Copper for Silver.One may as vvell lay the vveigh'd copper first upon the coppel, and let it glovv vvell, and aftervvards the due vveight of Lead, vvhich is as vvell; only the coppel must first be vvell vvarmed, othervvise the Lead will leap upon it, and the proof become false, which cannot be by the former way, because if the Lead which is set first alone upon the Coppel should leap, it may then quickly be made still again, if a live Coal be laid a little while on the top of it, and afterwards put the Copper upon it, so it will not hinder the Tryal.  Proof Instruments to have great care ofFurther, every Assayer ought to know when the Coppels are not made of good Ashes and well prepared, for hereby they become tender, and will rob the proof of some Silver; likewise, when he doth use a new Assay-Oven, to which he is not used, and doth not know well the Degrees of fire in it, so it is better that he may learn first to know well the nature of his Coppel and Oven, that he may trust to it, and this may be done in the following manner: Take a Copper Ingot, of which a Centner contains about forty Loth, or twenty Ounces of Silver (which in many Tryals hath been found of a certain Content) and of this make one or two Tryals one after another, as often as you do intend to change your Instruments; then, if you finde the first contents, you are certain of your Instruments, and there is no fault in them.  Concerning the black-iron-streamy-slacky and raw Copper they are not to be assay'd like the abovenamed good Proving of the black & raw CopperCopper upon the Coppel, therefore when you do intend Image 48 (page 50)  to try such, beat them small and weigh of them two equal Centners, put each of them in a particular clean Test, place them in an Assay-Oven, and when they are glowing through, put to every Tryal its due proportion of Lead, to wit, sixteen Centners (like them before) and make them warm, and so they will begin to slacke, but you must not let them slacke too much, for then the Lead will enter into the slacks, and there vvill remain too little Lead with the Copper, and so cannot go clean off, but if the proofs be right boyld up, then take them out, and let them cool in the Tests; afterwards separate the dross from it, and cause the Lead or work to go off upon the Coppel, as cold as can be, yet so as that the proofs (as hath been taught before) may not congeal too soon, but appear pure and bright, and hereby you will have the true Contents, because such unclean coppers when they are not boyled up at first, but enter raw upon the Coppel into the Lead, then they do slacke upon the Coppel and fret on it, and the proofs must be hotter, so that the true contents cannot be exactly found out.  The weight of the Coppels.Further also, I cannot leave unmentioned, That the Coppels after the proving of Copper do alwayes come heavyer out of the fire, than they were set�in at first, vvhich thing although it brings little profit to a Refiner to knovv; yet it is to be vvondred, vvhat the cause of it might be.   Page 51 CHAP. XVIII. To try Bell-metal for Silver.  BELL-metal, of old broken-Bells (vvhich is sometimes rich in Silver) must be tryed Bell Metal.like unto the black raw Copper; but because of the Tin that is in it, it must be boyled up stronger, therefore there must be to such Tryals, four parts more of Lead than to Copper, by which also the Lead doth loose more: Or, weigh of such Bell-metal only half a Centner, and allow to it so much Lead, as to a Centner of Copper, so it will slack clean, and there will remain enough of Lead with it, (after it is boyl'd up) to drive off in the Coppel.   CHAP. XIX. How old Silver-plate or Coyn is to be made into Grains.  For what the Graining of Silver is profitable.GRAINING of Silver is done for the most part when bad, broken or other forbidden Money (coyned in Hand) that the same may be all melted together and afterwards to Assay it, and to fit it for better coining, that also the bad Money may be rooted out of it: this is to be done thus; When there is much of it to be granulated, then must there first be a furnishing of necessary Instruments, viz. Crucibles Image 49 (page 52)  and Wind-Ovens, that one may easily granulate a great quantity of Silver in Plate or coin, and when you have all Necessaries, then set the crucible empty into the wind-oven, a good hand-breadth higher than the grate, and cover it with an Iron� cover, cover the crucible all over with coals and ashes, and upon them live coals, let the fire kindle from above downwards, then you need not fear, that it will be crack'd (as it happens sometimes  when it is set in a suddain heat) and when the crucible Why the Crucible so easily breakshath been set thus in the fire, and that the fire hath vvell kindled downwards, so that the crucible is red hot all over, then uncover it, and see if it is yet vvhole, and hath no crack, vvhich is soon seen in the glovving heat, then put in the Silver that hath been first vveighed in the crucible, and cover it, put coals over it, and give it a strong heat, that the Silver may sink, then may you put more Silver, if you have it into the crucible, and give it fire again, that it may sink, and also follovv it vvith the Silver, until the crucible be full, vvhen that is done, then give it fire enough, so long till the Silver in the crucible begins to drive, and when thou seest it drive then throw upon the Silver (in the Crucible) coal-dust, or Ashes that the Silver may be covered with it all over; stirr it well about with a glowing hot iron hook, and afterwards with a small warm Crucible take the Silver out of the greater Crucible, and pour it in cold vvater.  To granulate the Silver round.If you vvill have round Grains, then pour the Silver through a vvet Broom, but if you vvill have your Silver hollow and thin for separation then stir the vvater vvith a stick vvell about and pour the silver into the boyling vvater, so vvill it become hollovv and thin, or granulate it over a Waltzen.Role, (vvhich being half in and half out, the water vvill run about, so will it be hollow, after it is granulated; then pour the water off from the Grains, and dry them in a Copper bason over the fire. Page 53  But if there be many to be melted and granulated; the Crucible is to be set likewise into the wind Oven, and first kindle the fire by degrees, that it grow warm, that you may see if the Crucible doth remain whole, because How to govern the fire.if the same in the first kindling doth remain whole, it will hold well in melting, provided the first be well tended, so that the Crucible may not stand naked, but that it may have a like heat, because the place that is left naked the cold doth work upon it, and in that part doth easily break, therefore it is necessary to put the coals sometimes down about the Crucible with an iron Instrument, that the Crucible may by preserv'd, and when the Crucible is glowing warm and whole, then put with an iron Instrument (which is made purposely for it) the old Silver therein, that the Crucible may be heap'd full, and put the cover upon it, and afterwards coals, and give it convenient heat, and the Silver will easily sink down, and still go on in putting in Money so long till the Crucible be full with the melted stuff, and then give it a strong fire or two, that it may be fully hot in the Crucible, and when you see that it doth cast a black Scum upon the Crucible (which scum you must take off with a Scummer full of holes, and let it be cold) then sift it through a fine hair seeve, that the grains of Silver which have been taken (with the scummer) out of the Crucible may be put to the other Grains; keeping the black dust that falls through the hair Seeve, because there is yet silver in it, which afterwards you may make to profit; when you have taken all the scum from the Crucible, then cast again some clean coal-dust upon it, give it fire once more, that it may be very warm, and drive it, if it be not so, then the contents of the grains comes not alike, and it happens sometimes, that that which is not alike must be granulated again, which can not be done without loss, therefore be carefull at the first, and Image 50 (page 54)  do not hasten too much with it, so when it is full hot in the Crucible, then may it in the same manner (as hath been taught above) be taken out of the Crucible, and be cast through a wet Broom (which hath not many small twigs) into the water, or, if there be much to be cast, then have two Brooms to cast through, that the one after the other may be dipt into the water, this is the common way of granulating, and it is the best vvay to do it, by vvhich the grains have an equal content, and near finely round.   CHAP. XX. To granulate out of a Kiln.  FURTHER, there is another way to granulate (novv used) call'd Granulating out of the Kiln, and is thus: Cause a Kiln The manner of performing it.to be made of Potters earth (a little above a Span diameter within) which must have Iron-hoops, and the middle ring or hoop must have a long Iron-handle, and at the end of the handle a ring; likewise the Kiln is to be cut out on that side towards the Bellows, and when there is an Intention to granulate in the Kiln, then it must be set before the mouth of strong Bellows, and coals put in it, and after let the Bellows blow into it, that it may glow well; and then the old Silver (with an Iron-ladle) must be put on the top of the Coals, and the Bellows must blow always, so will it melt easily; and put still more silver, and let it flow: do this so long till as much Silver is in the Kiln as it can hold� stir it well about, after that, Take the Kiln vvith the coals in it, from the Bellows, and take it vvith the handle upon thy arm, and the ring which is at the end of the handle in thy hand, by which Page 55 you may govern the Kiln, and so granulate it out of  the Kiln, through Brooms as hath been said before. This is a quick way to granulate, but the Contents of the old Silver is sometimes not found alike, and it  doth also waste more than by other grainings or granulatings: A quick way of granulating.Now as often as there is need to melt in such a Kiln, it is necessary to do it alvvayes well over with a good Clay, that may hold well in the fire, otherwise, when the Metal is warm, it may flow through it. It happens also often, that if a Crucible doth leak or or run out; and in that case sweep all clean together, put  it in a Vessel and pour vvater on it, and that vvhich When the Crucible doth break.doth swim at top, take off, and throw away, and pour other water on it, this do so long untill the water doth go clear off, then out of the Residue pick out the course sand and stones, and stamp the rest in a Morter and searse it through a hair seeve, that which doth not pass keep it, because it is good, but that which goeth through, vvash that again in a long Tub made of Firr, that the residue of the good may be got out: because where much is to be granulated there will be sometimes some Mischance, so that a Crucible may run out, and cannot be rectifi'd again without loss and dammage.

GRanulated Silver hath different Contents, therefore according to its contents The different Contents of Graind Silver.the Addition of Lead must be: but that there may be a true Understanding of the difference, so the Addition of Lead (according to the Contents) must be taken thus, viz. to that vvhich contains fifteen Loth of fine Silver, the Lead must be 5 or 6 times the quantity, and to that vvhich is burnt Silver, (and is 15 Loth and three drams in the Contents) to such there needs but four times the quantity. But if the Grains are from 12 to 14 Loth, then take to one Mark, ten Marks of Lead, and upon 14 Loth Contents, take  The different Quantities of Lead.nine quantities, from 9 unto 12 Loth Contents, take 16 quantities; and from one to eight Loth-Contents, take 18 quantities: and although upon some Contents there might well be one or two quantities more, than one too little: so that the Proof may have its due of Lead, and if the proof is right governed there will be no vvant.  When you are ready to assay such Grains or old silver, then set first the Coppels into the Oven, and not Assay Grains.above tvvo silver Tryals at a time: Let them be vvell neale'd and heated, and then put the vveight of the silver or grains, to two equal marks of thy penny weight, place each of them into a small Test or put first the prepared Lead for the proof upon the Coppel, and let it begin to work, and after it, also the weighed grains; govern the fire by covering the Furnace, as also by putting Image 52 (page 58)  the Instruments under the Muffle, that the proof may go off alike, and pretty cool; cause afterwards the Grains to shine bright, yet not over hot, that they may not bolt or fly out, else the proof will be false. Further, know also, that the Grains which are rich in Copper (and can endure much cold in trying) must be kept coldest, and afterwards let it shine clear (if the Contents be truly to be found) and that which is not rich  To assay rich Grains.in Copper, with less coolness vvill leave its subtil Littarge on the Coppel (as hath been said above.) But the Burnt silver and the very rich Grains cannot endure the cold because it hath no streamy Copper with it, and the proof would easily congeal, and if this should happen there would be no Remedy afterward, but it must be done again, therefore such proofs must go off a little hotter.  When the Proofs have too little Lead.But if it should happen (by not minding it) that to one poof, there should be one or two quantityes of Lead too little, then the Proof will not shine clearly at all; which is easily to be seen by the Grains, when there are little Spots upon them: as also black and wrinkly, and not very clean, such Tryals are false, and must be begun anew.  When the Proofs do go too hot.Also it is to be noted, That if the proof do go too hot, then the Lead will carry more than ordinary, of Silver with it into the Coppel: and what one hath in the beginning of the proof, that he vvill finde; only have a Care that the Grains (in the end) may be clean and clear, so you vvill finde the true Contents.  To make assay grains fine.When the Grains are gone off clean, then they must be struck off from the Coppels while they are vvarm, so do they go off clean from the Clar, but if there should yet stick something about it, then press the Grains with clean flat tongs, and the unclean will fly avvay: Further, Brush it vvith an hard Brush, clean off, and vvhen they are very clean, then vveigh them one against another, Page 59 if they be alike and do stand even at the Globe of  the Ballance, then is the proof right: weigh then one grain by it self, and see hovv many Loths, Drams and Pence, it hath by thy Assay-weight, that you may find by it, the true Contents, and see that the Lead-grain be alwayes abated, though it be never so little.   CHAP. XXII. How coin'd Money in great or small Sorts may be Assayed.  WHAT concerns good and Gross Money, as Dollers and new Rix Gilders, try them Of Dollers and rix Gilders.thus, Take the piece you do intend to try, beat it flat at one end, upon a smooth clean Anvil, that it may be cut with small Sheers used for Silver, and so cut it into little pieces, and weigh them according to your Grain weight, two, alike Marks, put this into a small Test, and make a Tryal; if it be Dollers: put nine quantities of pure Lead, and to the new Gilders, put eight quantities, cause them to glow off in a reasonable heat) and cold (as you have been before instructed) and such proofs (when they are govern'd well in the fire) do yield a pretty deal of fine and subtil Litarge on the Coppel, which the unexpert Assayer knows not.  It is also necessary to know, That neither these nor other proofs do leave any Littarge on the Coppel, if they To assay with coverd Assay ovensbe not done in Coverd Ovens, of which Tryals many Refiners do know nothing (as hath been said) therefore they do seldom bring a Proof to its true contents, for they know not how they must order their Coppels according to the quantities of Lead, which is of no small Concern, Image 53 (page 60)  that they may not have too many nor too few Ashes, because, if there be too few Ashes, then the Coppel will become soft, because of the much Lead which they suck in, which easily doth draw the silver with it into the Coppel, so the Contents is lessened, and if there be too many Ashes then the Coppel will be too big, and take too much room in the Furnace, and are not so convenient for use.  To assay single and double Stivers.Concerning single and double Stivers, they must be Assay'd in the following manner, Take two or three and cut them with Sheers into little pieces, and weigh two equal Marks, or pieces or parcels according to the Grainweight, and take great care that you have some of the out-side for the Tryal to both alike, because the proof that hath most of the out-side will be found richer in the Contents than the other that hath not so much of the outside.  The Lead quantity.Put to each Mark or Proof eighteen Quantities of pure Lead, cause them to go off pretty cool, and at last to shine clear, which then also doth leave subtil Littarge upon the Coppel, yet not so much as of the Dollers; then if the Grains are of an equal weight, the Proof is right, draw one of the two up, with the Grain-weight, and as many Loths and Grains as you do find, so much is there Content in a Mark of fine silver.  Upon white Pence, Reinish and other Pence the proof To Assay Pence.is thus; Take twelve of them, and cut of each of them a bit or two for a Tryal, only take notice that you do take of such Pence, some bit where it is thick, and of some where they are thin, that to each Tryal there may be some of the thin and some of the thick Bits: add to each Tryal eighteen Qantities of pure Lead, and cause them to go at first fine and cool; and lastly, to shine bright, so will the Grains be alike; but, if in the one Proof there be much of the thin, and in the other much of the Page 61 thick Pence should come, then the Grains would not  be alike, but oft times the proof in which much of the thin Penny did come, that fine Grain will be almost two Grains more; and the other so much less in which most of the thick did come. This is not much minded by some Refiners, but when their Grains do differ, then they do take the middle of it, but it is better the proof be right and that by diligence, the proofs may come out alike, because the  small Money by boiling white doth differ in the Contents, To finde the true Proof in small Money.so is the proof now adays better to be found than to melt a Mark of the Money in a Crucible, and so soon as it begins to drive, to cast it into an Ingot, and then to make a tryal of it so (without question) the true Contents will be found, and agree with the other proof made of the thin and thick Bits. I must mention also, that some Refiners and Assayers are about to prove Coyn'd Money with the Low Dutch Penny weight (which is not amiss) because the Contents do agree with the Grain-weight; as for Example, Suppose you have assayed new Gilders, according to the Grain-weight, and have found that the Mark doth contain fourteen Loth and sixteen Grains, but according to the Low Duch Penny-weight, twelve pence and four grains, these twelve pence and four grains make just so much as 14 Loth, and 16 Grains, and so both of these are of one Content, yet of two Denominations.  To Assay the Silver, according to the Common Centner weight.If it should happen that an Assayer should be in such a place where he hath no more then one Centner-weight, nor could have any more, and there should come before him Grains of coyn'd Money, or a Lump of Silver to try, how much a Mark of the same doth contain (of Loths, Drams and Pence, or of Loths A loth is Half an ounce.and Grains) of fine Silver, he must take out of the Centner-weight sixteen pound, and let them be a Image 54 (page 62) Mark or sixteen Loths, the eight Pound, eight Loths; the four Pound, four Loths; the two Pound, two Loths, and one Pound, one Loths; after that, the sixteen Loths two drams; the eight Loth one dram, the four Loths, two Peny-weight: the two Loths, one Peny: and one Loth, a Heller or Half-penny. If he hath then assayed a piece of Silver according to such weights, then may he find the Contents easily upon Loths, Drams or Pence, but concerning new Gilders, which commonly do hold fourteen Loths sixteen Grains, they will hold in such a peny-weight fourteen pound, and 28 Loths, or a little more (which would be according to the above-named Directions) also fourteen Loths, three Drams, two Pence, and almost half an Heller or half-penny, do carry 14 Loths and 16 grains.  In like manner one may for Gold take to 24 Carats 16 pounds of the Centner-weight, and assay the Gold To assay the Centners upon Grains.according to it, but it is better if an Assayer hath by hand the Assay-weight, already parted to make use of the same, because to mind this doth require an expert Assayer, for an unexpert one will easily err.   CHAP. XXIII. How Burnt silver Pieces and Plates are to be cut out.  IF you will cut-out a piece of burnt Silver, then first cut a piece out at the top, with a small half-round Chissel, not quite Burnt silver Pletes.in the middle, nor quite at the end, then turn that piece of Silver, and cut in like manner a piece out of the bottom, that it may not be all from one side, but opposite to the piece that was cut at the top of the other side, that is to be cut on the back side. Page 63  But concerning Plates, cut them out at one side above, and the other below, and weigh of each half a Mark for a proof, put them together in the Proof-Scales, that is into one Scale, and into the other put the whole Mark, Plates.opposite into the other Scale, if it be not just alike, as it should be, then make it so, that the Scales may stand equal (and assay as you have been taught)� Blink Silver. Clear Silver may also be cut out also above and below in like manner for to be assay'd; and so the Contents will alwayes be found just when the Proofs have been well made.   CHAP. XXIV. How Silver Touch-Needes are to be made.  THE silver Touch-Needles (which are also called Proof-Needles) they are generally made and used by all Refiners and Guardians, and they that deal in Silver: by which Touch all Silver-Contents may very nearly be known: Now to make  such it is very necessary to have weights that are a pretty To make them.deal bigger than common Assay-Weights: And then take good fine Silver, and of it make the first Needle, (and make a Mark on it) viz. 16 Loth of fine: And to the Second Needle, take 15 Loth of fine Silver, and one Loth of fine Copper: and Image 55 (page 64)   To the Third 14 Loth of fine Silver and 2 Loths of Copper. To the Fourth 13 Loth of fine Silver and 3 Loths of Copper. To the Fifth 12 Loth of fine Silver and 4 Loths of Copper. To the Sixth 11 Loth of fine Silver and 5 Loths of Copper. To the Seventh 10 Loth of fine Silver and 6 Loths of Copper. To the Eighth 9 Loth of fine Silver and 7 Loths of Copper. To the Ninth 8 Loth of fine Silver and 8 Loths of Copper. To the Tenth 7 Loth of fine Silver and 9 Loths of Copper. To the Eleventh 6 Loth of fine Silver and 10 Loths of Copper. To the Twelveth 5 Loth of fine Silver and 11 Loths of Copper. To the Thirtenth 4 Loth of fine Silver and 12 Loths of Copper. To the Fourteenth 3 Loth of fine Silver and 13 Loths of Copper. To the Fifteenth 2 Loth of fine Silver and 14 Loths of Copper. To the Sixteenth 1 Loth of fine Silver and 15 Loths of Copper.   To try themWhen you have weighed all these, then put every Needle's proportion into a Crucible, and do not let it drive much, for thereby the Needles may prove false: but so soon as the Silver and Copper in the Crucible begins to drive then stir it with a dry Splinter (or stick) and cast each proportion into a small Ingot, out of which the Needles are to be made, which you may shape as you please, and put a mark or distinction on each Needle, according to the Contents of each, thereby to see how many loths of fine Silver a Mark doth contain, that you may not be deceived by the Touch, but thereby make a right Judgment.  Needles half Loth.Some do part and divide the Needles into two halfloths, which is left to every ones Freedom, and there is enough in it, where the Touch may not be certainly known by the loth, Now when thou dost intend to use the Needles, then upon the Silver which thou hast made, scrape a fine shining stroak, and also make another stroak on the Needle by it, and see which stroak on the Needle is most like the Silver-stroke, and so you will see by Page 65 them how much the Silver doth contain: and that the  form of the Touch-Needles may be seen, this following Sculpture doth represent.  Sculpture VIII.  Deciphered. 1. 2. The Touch-Needles. 3. 4. The Ingots to be compared with the Touch-needles.     CHAP. XXV. How Mettals that are melted must be cut out, and assayed for Silver.  OF wrought (lead which is Cast in melting of the silver Oars) some are clean and Clean work.pure, and others are foul and unclean; the Clean which come from the mild and good Oars, them, you may by themselves prove like unto Lead, and take a Proof out of it, when 'tis going to melt, and weigh Image 56 (page 66)  of it at least a Centner, or else when the work is cast forth, as much as it doth weigh is to be cut and assayed together: And keep this Order, that always of the whole that is cast, a special proof may be made, and to take it out of 2 or 3 proofs: or else the true Content will not be found, except it be that of each cast piece the whole quantity be weighed in, and to go off upon a great Coppel altogether; but if you would have for a Proof some cut out of the Cakes, you may cut out of each (especially if the Work be rich) according to the bigness above and below, to weigh some of all, and to prove it.  There are also some works which are very missy �nclean work.and speizy and very unclean (like Kobolt and course Wismet and other speizy Oars) which are melted; and some among the rest are so very unclean that when the Cakes do lye a few daies, they do fall asunder: such stubborn and unclean Oars, in general, cannot be assayed like unto the good; but when such Work hath been weighed, then cut or beat out of every Cake a piece, and weigh it so unclean as it is, viz. of every cut, and assay as followeth: Take of the work as much as it is in weight, put it on the Test in the Assay-oven, cause it to slack, that the Fury and wildness may be consumed, let it cool and knock it off, and cause it to go clear off from the Coppel, but if it be not slacked at first, but set raw upon the Coppel, then it will work upon the Coppel, and will not go clean off, as is shewn. Some Assayers do use to take the Content of such unclean  Another Custom among Assayers.work, and cause it to go together in a great Assay-Test or Iron-Kiln, and cast it forth, and then weigh of it for a Tryal, which is not right (although they do think they shall obtain the true Contents) because by this running together the Contents comes finer, and the proof is made richer, therefore the abovesaid way is much better, by which the true Contents is found. Page 67  But when an unclean Work is put upon the Coppel, then to imagine (when a work of it self will not go off that to add some other clean Lead, and to help it that When there is lead added to the work Tryal.way, that it may go off pure) is vain. For this cannot be a certain way of their Proofs, nor are you to trust to the same: Because in the Work-houses the Lead is not altogether without Silver, so the Silver is found in the lead that is added (as little as it is in the other Contents) which becomes so much richer.  Harth tryalsLikewise as it hath been said, of casting and working, how they are to be tryed, so it must be done with hearth Tryals, they which are overlaid with Silver and richwrought Lead, and taken from the Hearths, let it be good, or unclean, only that at least, the half of the whole weight may be weighed and tryed, so will you finde the fine Silver very near, yet not altogether fully, because the unclean that was at first in the Work, and hath been weighed with it (before the Harth� proof was taken off the work) when it is in driving was dissolved and taken off; as also sometimes the Proof is taken off too hot, and sometimes too cold, by this may every Assayer understand the Contents: and which (although, as hath been said, in comparison of the Silver that is brought forth) is not much out of the way.   CHAP. XXVI. How Tin is to be assayed for Silver.  TIN among the rest of Metals doth enter most freely into Lead, but the strength of the fire will not permit it to remain therewith, because as soon as there comes great heat to it, then doth it go again, and rise upon the Lead, and becomes altogether Image 57 (page 68)  together stubborn, so that with no force of fire, besides other help, can it be brought to a true �p-boyling upon the Test, because the Tin doth oft times contain much Silver, and the Tryal of it is very necessary: Therefore was I the more willing to instruct young Assayers of the Tryal of it, which is done thus: Weigh two equal half Centners of the Tin, and to each half Centner, a Centner of good sound Copper, and sixteen quantities of pure Lead, put each half Centner with its Copper and Lead upon a Test, each by themselves: Begin first with a slow heat, and when it begins to drive upon the Test, it will begin to rise, then let it go very cool, and take two Centners off the abovesaid Lead-glass put it also to it, upon the Test, and the Lead-glass will cover it all, and will not suffer the Tin to rise so much: and when you have let it go cool so long (till the risen Tin upon the Test doth no more look bright, but black and dark) then give it again as much Heat as you can, and boyl it up (as you do an unflowing harsh Oar) and when it hath slack'd well, then stir it with an hot Iron-hook, let it stand a while longer, untill it be boyl'd up very clean, then take it out of the Oven, suffer it to cool, beat the slacks off from the work or Lead, and let it go off upon a Coppel: if then the Tin doth hold Silver, there will remain a grain upon the Coppel, draw it up, and you will finde the Contents.  The Leadgrain to this Tryal.To such a Proof must you make a Lead-Grain on purpose, thus; Take a Centner of the Copper of which you did add to the Proof, cause it diligently to go off upon the Coppels with the Lead quantity: and keep the Grain of Silver that comes from it which (in the drawing up of the Proof-Grain all times to the Weight) is to be laid and abated, else one cannot be certain of the Contents: and after this manner in Tin the right Contents is to be found. Page 69  Some Assayers are of another Opinion, to beat the Tin thin, and weigh of it two half Centners, and put every one upon a Test by it self in the Assay-oven, give Another way to prove the Tin.it a gentle heat that the Tin may be wasted into Ashes; and into the same Ashes (yet every one apart) they put 16 Centners of Lead and two Centners of the Flus upon a Test, and boil it up like unto an Hard-flowing Oar, and let it go off upon the Coppel, this proof is also right, but it requires a little more time than the former, although the Tin doth also rise upon the Plate (yet it may easily (by governing of the fire, when it hath first cooled and afterwards yery hot) be forc'd to slack cleanly.   CHAP. XXVII. How to separate Iron and Steel from Silver.  ALSO there is found sometimes Iron very rich in Silver, the reason is, because the Hammer-smiths do not mind the small contents in it, also they do not know that it contains any Silver, and so, that Silver in melting cometh among the Iron: to prove this, that the certain contents of the Silver may be given in: File the Iron very small (which you do intend to assay) weigh of it half a Centner, and add to it a Centner of yellow Brimstone, and let it go off  With Brimstone.mingled well together and set it in a gentle heat, that only the Brimstone may flow and penetrate the Iron, and that it may be brought out of its substance, and let the Iron cool again in the Test, grind it again upon a Stone or Iron, and mingle two Centners of Flus, or Lead-glass among it; and add to it twelve Centners of Lead, cause it to boyl up (as you are wont to do, with a hard flowing Image 58 (page 70)  OAR) and in the end the work that cometh off, let it go off upon the Coppel, and you will find the Contents of the Silver.  With Antimony.Some Assayers do use to prove Iron for Silver another way, namely, they weigh the Iron (although it be not fyled small) viz. half a Centner and put it in a Crucible, and add to it a Centner of Antimony, let them go together, then let the Crucible cool, and put that which did drive in the Crucible upon an Assay-Test, let it smoak away, and grind it again upon an Iron-plate or Stone very small; mingle it with Flus (with an addition of the Lead as hath been shewed in the proof before) then cause it to boyl up clean, and let it go off upon a Coppel, but if the Lead be black (because of the Antimony) then set it upon the Test alone, cause it to slack (as other wild unclean Work) then it will go off upon the Coppel.  With gross-Flint.Others take small fil'd or thin beaten Iron, cut of it half a Centner, as also a Centner of raw gross-water flints, which holdeth no Silver (with its due of Lead) mingle it together and assay it (as raw Flint is assayed upon Silver) so the Brimstone which is in the Flint will devour the Iron, that it will become Slacks, and will then go into the Lead, and although the Flint holdeth a little Silver, yet that may be abated instead of the Lead-grain, and this way of Assaying Iron for Silver; I have found to be most fit, and it is done with little trouble, and the contents is also found right.  Copper and Iron, as also Silver and Iron love one another To separate the Copper, Iron, and Silver.well, and these three Metals cannot be so separated, that a part may remain, to do any profit with: yet by a right understanding of their Nature this is possible; that from the two most constant among these three (as Silver and Copper) the Iron may be separated (being as an unclean Metal to those two) also the Copper dross, Page 71 (which is separated in the Melting and doth contain Silver)  may be separated; which parting is done in the following manner.  The Lead-Oar hath commonly Antimony with it, How the Coppery Iron which holds Silver is to be made to profit.which (in melting as a soft flowing Metal) doth enter into it and devoureth it) for this end, and to prevent it, a due proportion of Lead must be added to the Iron in melting (as there shall be further Instruction given in the Fourth Book) for the Lead Oar (by Reason of the Antimony that is in it) doth work upon the Iron, and taketh the Copper and Silver to it self, which is the Reason, that at such places where the Lead-Oar is melted, the iron rich Copper Dross (which doth contain some Silver) may be used with Lead-oar in stead of old Iron, which is to be put among it by degrees, and so the Iron will be consusumed, and the Silver and Copper will enter into the Lead, which to my mind could not be imploy'd better; but in the melting after the Gosslarish manner, the Lead doth mingle among the dust, whereby it doth partake of much of the uncleaness and wildish Nature which is in the Dust and slacks, and so is left with it: But how the Copper is to be separated from the Lead will follow hereafter.  Iron-stone that contains Silver.And in this manner the Iron-stone (that contains Silver may be made to enter into the Lead-Oar, that it may take the Silver out of it, which cannot be done better; and this I was willing to impart for the better instructing of them, that Assay Iron and such melting works.   Image 59 (page 72) CHAP. XXVIII. How Black or white Silver is to be burnt clean, and how the Tests for it are to be made right.  SILVER-burning is to burn Silver pure and clean and deft upon a Test, and this Deft or neatis to be done to the Blink Silver (which is not yet clean enough) by two ways; one way under the wood, before the Bellows) the other under the Muffle, and is only done with Coales. But I intend to write first of the Tests in which the Silver is to be burnt clean; they are to be made and  To prepare the Tests.prepared thus, Take Ashes from which Lees hath been made, which are not sharp or salt: wash them and let them be dry, and keep them for your use, and when you do intend to make a Test, first get an earthen unglazed test such as the Potters use to make in their frames, and so large as thou wouldst have them, pour water in it, and make it wet all over, that the Ashes may stick the better, then put some Ashes into it, which must first be moistned like unto the Copel-Ashes, put it two fingers high in the Test, press it together with a wooden Pestel, which hath about eight Angles: then put more Ashes after it, press them also down, do it so long till the Test be full, then stroke off the superfluous Ashes with an Iron made on purpose from the test, and turn it about the Brim (with a round wooden Ball) so as the Ashes may lye smooth doon upon the test, afterwards cut it, with a round sharp bent Iron, according to the bigness of the Silver that is to be burnt upon it, and when the test is cut out, then must you have a small hair Page 73 Seeve, and put ground Bone-Ashes in it, and swigle or  strew it over the test, that it may be white all over, and then turn the Ball over it, that it may lye smooth upon the test, so is the test ready.  The manner of this Burning.When you intend to use such test, and to burn in it, then first make a Small-coal fire upon it, that it may be dry, then set it before the Bellows very even, so that the Bellows may blow just into it, which is to be known thus, hold a shovel over the test, and if the blowing of the Bellows do go off from the shovel and blows off all the Ashes and dust out of the test, it doth stand right, and then beat the piece of Blink-silver into bits, but first put a little straw into the test, and the bits of silver upon it; Give it fire and coals that the test and the silver may be well covered, then begin to blow, so the silver will melt easily, and begin to drive, then put away with an iron-hook all the Coals from the silver, and stroak the silver also clean off, yet so that nothing may be lost, then lay split wood, or other wood for fire, and fit for the purpose, and cause the Bellows to blow under  Wood for the burning of Silver.the Wood upon the silver, so the silver will begin to drive under the wood, and that lead which did remain among the silver will be drawn into the test: only consider� when such split wood is burnt upon the test, then put more wood by or upon it, that still the silver may be burnt with a fresh flame, and so will it be sooner clean, while the silver doth yet go upon the test, and it must be stirred about with a round bowed Iron-hook, and made glowing hot, whereby the silver may be clean, or else it will retain some lead underneath.  The content of burnt Silver.But that the Silver may not be Burnt so much, but may have a right and true content, namely, fifteen loth, and three drams, (which commonly the burnt Silver is to have) then you may in the mean time once or twice, with a well pointed Iron, (thrust a little into the Silver) Image 60 (page 74)  and take a proof out (which will hang easily about it) then beat it off, and see if it hath much yellow Litharge, or beat it upon an Anvile, and if it be Deft, then the Silver is well burned, if not put the proof in again, and let the Silver drive longer upon the Test, until you do find the proof upon the Iron, white and deft, but the Silver upon the Test cannot be overdone, because the Test grows soft from superfluous heat, and take more Silver to it than it ought; all which is well to be observed, and diligent exercitation or use is needful, if one will burn blinck Silver upon a certain content.  How the Silver doth cool.And if by negligence, the Silver (before it is done) doth become cool, put again Coals upon it, begin it again and burn it that it may be right, for the hard burnt Silver do (in Coyning) hurt: of which afterwards a great dammage will follow.  Silvers that are not burnt too high.Some of the Refiners in the burning of Silver do put upon every Mark of Silver a half Loth or Dram of good Copper that the Silver may not come too high, but upon their just content, not that it remaineth with the Silver, but because it goes together with the Lead in the Test, that the same burnt Silver (as we have heard) may not become of such a high content; this is a good intention in such places, where the Silver for Payment upon a certain content are given in, and, without proving, accepted, and there reasonable dilligence in burning may be so observed, that none of the parts may be wronged and hurt.  Coppery Blinck Silvers.Whole Coppery blinck Silvers, such as they make in the Refining Houses, may be burnt very Deft, but they will remain too light on the Content, to the same must be put a little Lead, (as much as it will permit) as sometimes likewise may be done to the Silvers which are melted of speizy and Cobolt Oars for their Wildness and uncleanness sake. Page 75  Now when the Burning is finished, and the Silver taken out of the Test, then is it to be fully quenched, whereby the Ashes will fall easily away, which stick about When the Silver burning is finished.it, and the rest of the Ashes must be taken away cleanly, with a strong Brush, and let the Silver be dry, and when the Thornels (if there be any) and the Silver hath taken hold on the Ashes, they must be beaten down with a Hammer, that the piece on all sides may be smooth. But that the Reader may have a larger understanding of the Silver Burning, also how the France, and Test, with all other things appertaining to them, are to be formed, is clearly to be seen by the following Sculpture, which is thus   Deciphered. 1.

B�RNING of Silver which principally is used in lower Saxony) requireth a singular and better Diligence than the Common silver burning, and also particular Tests and Muffles: The Tests you must make thus: Let the prepared Tests to be made with with Iron rings.Hoops be of Iron, of the bigness as you intend to burn a great or small piece of silver, they must be high of a hand square, but at the top a little wider than at the Bottom, in one of them put in the prepared Test-Ashes, and fill it to the top, still beating down gently (with a broad Hammer) the Ashes about the Brim; and so further and further till you have beaten down all the Ashes that are left, or are too much upon the Test, stroak them off with an Iron, and then overturn the Rings and test alike upon a little Ashes, which is to be laid under; then take them with your hand out of the test, till it is half empty, and make the Ashes small again with your hands, then press the test full again with a heap beating it down also with the Hammer, as is before directed, and the rest of the Ashes also stroak off with an Iron, then turn the test again, and make the Ashes smooth with the Ball, then the test is prepared: Now the tests after this manner prepared are much better and stronger than they which are beaten into the tests.  The Muffles for Silver burning.Concerning the Muffles which pertain to this Silver-burning, they are to be made over little round sticks after the bigness of the upper part of the test, and are to be cut out in the like form with the tests; and other Image 62 (page 78)  pertaining Instruments which the Sculpture following will shew. If now you will burn Silver, then put the Test with the Ring between four square burnt Stones in Sand or Ashes, as deep that the Sand may be even with the test above, in an Oven for it prepared, in which several tests may be put together, and such Wind-Ovens must have alwayes one Wind-hole, which may drive two Ovens, especially in such places wherein many pieces of Silver come together, and once in one day are to be burnt. Afterwards put the Muffle on the test, which is made after its bigness, and a burnt stone on the top, that nothing may fall upon the Silver, put coals upon and under the Muffle, and about and upon the test, and when the test is grown warm then put in the beaten silver, and let it begin to work, but if you would have it soon melted, then you may blow it with Handbellows, through the Mouth-hole under the Muffle, and then it quickly goeth, and when it is melted take away the Coals again, and let it go also under ths Muffle, stir it once or thrice with the Iron, as you have done in the other, then it will go upon the test, under the Muffle, all off: (just as the Silvers upon the Coppels.) With this burning of Silver both great and small pieces may be burnt, as with the Bellows, and without loss or any great damage upon the Content.  A clean silver burningAfter this manner, I have seen at Goslar in the Workhouse (when it was kept) upon one Test on one piece near one Hundred mark of Silver burning: If now you will (while the Silver goeth) take out with an Iron one or two provings (as is done in the Silver-burning before) you may do it (and it is not to be despised) but who in this ART is conversant, the same needeth not so many provings, but he knoweth it upon sight, when it hath enough. Page 79  Now when the Silver under the Muffle is burnt clear and begins to stay, one may let water run upon it in a Copper Channel and cool it, then with strong Tongs take it out and purify it from the Ashes, (as is abovesaid) then the Silver is burnt.  Tests to be kept.The Tests may be kept together, because they are not without Silver, the same in some Mine-works the Work-men use to take to themselves, but in some they belong to the Republique: They may be made at any time to profit, and the Silver that is in them may be melted out, as may be seen in the following Sculpture, and is thus   Deciphered. 1. The Oven in which the Silver is to be burnt. 2. The inside of that Oven. 3. The Wind-holes of that Oven which drives the fire upwards into the Work. 4. The Test that is set into it. 5. The Iron Mould or Ring into which the Tests are to be put. 6. The form of the Ironring. 7. The Ring fill'd with ashes for making a Test. 8. A round Muffle. 9. A Ball and Hammer for making of Tests. 10. A person that breaketh the burnt Silver. 11. Another person standing on the back-side of the Oven who takes Care for the burning of the silver. 12. A Vessel of water into which the burnt silver is to be cast. 13. Bellows and Instruments belonging to the Oven.  Image 63 (page 80)   Sculpture X.    Page 81 CHAP. XXX. How Copper is to be Assayed for fine Silver.  IN respect it is of use to burn the light-content silver fine (for many times they How much Lead is to be added.who should do it, know not fundamentally how much Lead is to be added, whereby they do too much, or too little) therefore to such light-silvers, if the Mark containeth eight Loths of silver, then ten times the weight of Lead is to be added, and if the Silvers containeth from eight to twelve Loths, eight weights of Lead, and then from twelve to fifteen Loth, six weights of Lead must be added, but if the burnt silvers centent should be fifteen Loth, then the Lead may be two weight less, but if it should be wholly cleansed, then tis better one weight too much then one too little, that the silver may be the cleaner: And when you have put it in the Test, let it be warm, and add two weights of Lead, and when it begins to go, then draw in the Silver gently, and let it go together, and when the Lead is almost gone, then add again two weights of Lead, do this as long till the Lead is all put in; and the Silver becomes clean, and when the Lead is done and singly added) there needs not so much Lead, as when the Lead is added to the Silver all at once: you must not force it, but do it as cool as it will permit, else the Silver will go more into the Test than otherwise; when now the Silver is almost purifyed, then gently turn it with a glowing Hook, least it retain a leady lump, or much smoak of Lead, but by this way it may clear it self and look pure. But as to the Coppery Silvers, if they are to be burnt Image 64 (page 82) fine upon the Test it cannot be done more conveniently than under the Muffle.  The Silvers which are to be burnt pure and clean with To take the smoak of Lead from Silver.Lead, do retain with them a smoak of Lead, if now one would bring it off, the same must be set upon a plain plate, and blow it with the Bellows, then they may become very clean.   CHAP. XXXI. How Silver is to be separated from Tin.  MANY times it happens that in burning Silver-Ware, Monys, Copper, and other Metals melted together (of which A Test for it.the most part oft times is TIN) that the same cannot be made to profit, nor separated by every common Gold-smith and Prover, therefore let this following way be an instruction (as the most convenient) namely, Put a test in an Oven, and a Muffle upon it, let both first well glow, and if the burnt matter be ten pounds then add upon the test twenty pounds of pure Lead at once together, and when it begins to go, then put in it of silvery rich TIN half a pound, then the Lead will take it soon to it self, which will quickly (from the great heat) begin to ascend, and to raise it self up; let it stand a while upon it, then draw it with an Iron Hook clear off from the Lead, then add more TIN to it, let it stand its time also in it, then draw it off also, and this infunding the Lead and drawing away, do as long till the burnt matter do all come upon the test, and if the Lead in working becomes weak, then refresh it again with one or two pound of new Lead, that it may endure the longer in the heat; but if the burnt matter be Coppery, it is the better; if not, you must Page 83 add somewhat of Copper, because it becomes more Deft  by it, and the Lead doth take the Silver and Gold easier in than out of the stubborn TIN only. In this work the Gold and Silver will go into the Lead, and the most of the Copper is drawn off with the TIN, then let the Lead go clean off, (as the Custom is) then have you the silver separated from it.  But to bring the Copper and Tin (which is drawn off) to profit, it may be done thus; let such stuff dry, and How to make the separated Tin profitable.cause it to melt in a strong Fire, and so the Bell-caster, or Founder may mingle it among their stuff and cast it together (as in Anno 1567. the City of Slakenword, in the Bohemish Borders was burnt down, and within the Walls of the City there remained not one House) when I my self did (after this manner) bring much burnt Metals to right, and separated the Silver from it, which no body else would take upon him to do.  To precipitate the Silver from Tin.The Philosophers do write of precipitating, by which the Silver in common tin may be put down, and formed into a Regulus; thus, one must set the tin apart in a little Oven, make it very hot, and then precipitate it, and with such a precipitation the Silver in the tin will be brought down a hand square, and the same in the same deepness may be cut off, and the remaining Tin may be again and again and so often cut off until the Silver in the bottom may be brought to a Regulus, and then (though tin be with it) it will purify fully, and that which doth precipitate will not hurt the tin, but they do write nothing of it: I signify this, for the sake of such, who have a pleasure to this Art, and are willing to Exercise themselves in it, and so take it into their further Meditation, that they may have hereby a way of doing it: I for my part suppose, that because the Gold in the Silver, and the Silver in Copper; is to be precipitated, that likewise this precipitation is possible in the tin.   Image 65 (page 84) CHAP. XXXII. How to drive out all sorts of Silver, that it may be Deft, smooth and fine.  BECAUSE it happens many times that Silver in casting together from an evil smoak (or when happily a little tin comes among it, or, that among the old Silver there hath been tinny, false and gross mixtures,) becomes hard: then is it, as  A little Lead Ball.follows, to be made Deft, again: Put the Silver upon a plain Test (which is done over with clean and fine Clar, blow it till the Silver runs and goes well, then add two or three Balls of very clean Lead, according to the quantity of Silver, blow it again until the Silver doth bear the Bellows, and becomes Deft; but you must (in the blowing upon the Test) once or tvvice (with a glovving Iron-Hook) stir the Silver that it may be Deft throughout, then let it cool, and put it in a Pot together as it pleaseth you, and take notice, that if somevvhat of the Copper be blovvn avvay, by vvhich the Silver on the content becomes richer, then if it shall retain the Content, vvhich it had before, it must (in the casting again) be helpt by adding so much Copper.  To Brickle hard burnt Silver.But hard burnt silver, (or other good silver, which might become brickle from a leady Lump) that same Silver (if a little Lead be with it) may (in this manner upon a plain Test) be made Deft without any addition; except it hath too much Lead with it self, then it must Page 85 be made upon a plain little Test (as above is taught) by  the Silver, burning-pure and Deft.  Also there may a Flus be prepared to make the Silver deft, (which doth cleanse the Metals very much:) A Flus to brickle Silver.thus, Take sal Alkali, Nitre, Red Argol, and salt Petre, of one so much as of the other, calcine, and dissolve it again in warm Water, and let it go through a filter and coagulate; so is the Flus prepared.   CHAP. XXXIII. How to boyl Copper from the pagment or old Silver in Coined Money, or from thin beaten plates of Silver. TAKE sulphur and vitriol of both alike in quantity, grind them small, and make them a little wet with Vinegar that it become as a Pap, mingle the Coyn or old Silver among it, then take a long Linnen sack, put the Money with these additions in it, sow the Sack on the sides from the top to the bottom, so that the Mony may not lye too thick in it, pour Water into a pot, and hang the Sack in it, that it may neither touch below, nor on the sides; boyl it well ten or twelve hours with the fire, and so much as the Water does wast by boyling, you must add to it again with warm Water, so that the Pot may be always full of Water, whereby the Copper will be boyled out of the Silver or Coyn, and the Silver will remain in the Sack, then wash it with warm Water and pour it together, but the Water will boyl and dry in, and the rest melt together (with the Flus vvhich is used to Copper Oar) Image 66 (page 86)  thus you have the Copper which hath been boyled out of the Money, only the silver by this is not altogether fine but retaineth some small quantity of Copper in it.   CHAP. XXXIV. How good proof Ballances are to be made and fitted.  APROVER hath not only need that he have clean and just Ballances for proving, An Assayer able to make Ballances,but he must know also when they do fail (or else become changeable or uncertain) how to mend and help them again, so I judge it for a great piece of Ignorance (and it is also not well,) That some who profess themselves Provers of this ART, do often (when a little is amiss in the Ballance, or worn out, or for any other small matter) use to send to Neurembirg and other more remote places in Germany, to mend their false Proof-Ballances, whereas they themselves should have so much Knowledg as to make and fit them with their Proof-weights, and Proof Instruments, so as they may be certain and sure of their Proofs.  And how to help their Defects.Therefore, That a fundamental Instruction may be given, I will instruct all who do love this Proof ART (especially the young Provers) because there are not alwayes Masters to be had, who know right well to mannage such things: and to teach how the Proof-Ballances and weights, and other Proof-Instruments are to be made, and also (if it be needful) to mend and rectify them: and first I shall begin with the Proof-Ballance,  The Ballance of the Proofseales.which is to be made as followeth. Cause a small Ballance to be forged out of the blade Page 87 of an old Sword, that it may have a little broad and  thin Tongue, and throughout be pure and well wrought, and nothing ruff or shivery be on it; this formed Ballance make fast with a little Screw, and file the thickest part, and then search the middle on the same place, and make a little hole with a drill through it, and fasten a round point in it, that it may stand out at both ends; fit it in, with thin bits of Brass, and soder it (with Silversoder} fast into the Ballance, so the soder will easily flow after the thin Brass.  Out of this sodered point are filed the little Irons on which the Ballance moves, and afterwards the little Tongue.Tongue beaten thin upon a smooth Anvil, and glow it often in a small Wood-fire, that it may not crack, then Wartz See the Dictionary.search the middle of the Tongue, from the Wartz or little Iron streight upward unto the end of the same (and its length is to be the same from the Wartz to the end) and mark it with a stroak, then cut upon the one side of the Tongue next to the stroak a bit of the Iron clean off, and on the other side of the Tongue, cut some also close by the Wartz, that the Tongue may rowl over from one side to the other, then may you also cut off the rest of the Iron on that side, when this is done, then glow the Tongue and dress it again straight upwards, then file it (upon a soft piece of Wood, very smooth, according to your pleasure; you may also pierce (or make holes) neatly in the Tongue near the Ballance for curiosity sake) afterwards bend a little the two ends of the Ballance alike, before the Ballance be quite fitted, that the two ends may be of equal length, and then file the Ballance according to shape and form, as a well proportioned proof Ballance, and so make an end; but how the filing and other Work is to be performed, that cannot be written, but it requireth a dilligent exercise. Image 67 (page 88)  The Fork in which the Ballance useth to hang, that must also in like manner be subtilly Filed, also the holes (in which the little Wartz come to lye) may be thin, clean and strait through it, and must be pollisht with a smooth little Stone, that no shivers may remain, which Fork must be so long as the Tongue, that the Ballance may not slide out of it.  When the Fork is prepared, then take the Fyled How the filed Ballance is to be proved.Ballance, and hang it in the Fork with the Tongue downwards, and see if it be alike weight on both sides, if you find that one side is heavier than the other, you must help it until it does hang even, then make it smooth and clean all over with a gentle Fyle or with a soft Whetstone, and pollish it with the hard Haemathite.Bloudstone, (which is called Glasscup) when the Ballance is fully finished, then prove it again, that the Fork may hang even, and that it want nothing. But if there is no Smith, which can forge the Ballance with the little Tongue (because all Smiths cannot make it so well of one piece) then take a clean steel Wyer, or a forged Iron in the form of a of a Ballance without the Tongue) and soder it with silver soder, and fix the little Tongue upon it, the Tongue may also be garnisht vvith Brass, aftervvards File a Ballance for it, (as hath bin said above) but if you vvill not take the pains to Garnish it with Brass, then may you take Gold-soder and soder all vvhat is necessary about Golden solder.the Ballance very cleanly, because this soder vvill flovv upon the Iron vvithout any addition or increase, and if any thing doth break upon it, it may be neatly sodered with Gold soder, as experience vvill teach.  The proof scales are used to be made blew, (that they To cause the proof Ballance to be blew. may not rust so easily) and is done thus, cause a pretty thick Iron to be warm in the fire, but do not suffer it to be quite brown, lay the Ballance with one end upon it, and draw it a long as it takes colour and becomes blew, Page 89 which is soon done, only take notice the more a place  is thin, so much sooner doth it heat and cool, therefore it is soon seen, that such places do turn white again in fair Weather, and clear shining, and these Ballances become of a fairer blew, then if they were done in dull Weather, as experience does manifest. Now how that forged Ballance, as also the Filed Scales are to be formed, is to be seen in the following Sculpture thus   Deciphered. 1. The forged Ballance. 2. The Fork of that Ballance forg'd. 3. The half forg'd Fork. 4. Filed Scales with the half Fork. 5. The Pearl and Pendula's, the one fastned on the top of the Fork, the other fastned to the bottom of the Tongue and Fork. 6. One end of the Beam, (and the like is to be suppos'd at the other end of it. 7. How the Ballance the Pearch and Pendula are to hang, on the Wartz (or little Filed pieces of Iron,) on each side of the bottom of the Tongue. 8. The Holes in each end of the Fork. 9. The little Hole at the end of the Ballance, (and the like is to be supposed at the other end of it.) 10. The Scales like small dishes. 11. Pincers to take up small Weights or pieces.  Image 68 (page 90)  Sculpture XI.    Page 91 CHAP. XXXV. Of Filing or Joyning the proof Ballance or Scales.  FILING and Joyning of proof Scales is a special Science, and is the true Masterpiece, To fit Scales. which is not known to every one that can make them, and is done thus; when the proof Ballance is Filed out, (as hath been said before) then make, of Silver, two flat clean and smooth scales, and also two very  The weight of the Scales to the Ballance. thin small scales, the which are called inset scales, which altogether are to be as heavy as the Ballance, or rather a little heavier than lighter, and put fine silk Thred to them, in length of the whole Ballance, from one end to the other, such Threads are to have a neat Knot on the top,  The Knots,whereby the strings may hang to the ends of the Ballance, and when the strings are made fast to the scales, then weigh them one against the other, with another proof scales, and see if they do weigh alike, then hang them to the ends of the Ballance, put the inset scales therein, and hang the Assay-ballance in a Case made on purpose, and draw them up gently, if then the scales do turn on the one side; that is, when you do press the scales down on the one side, that the scales remain down, as also on the other side, and will not go back but remain standing, then the fault is in the Beam, that on the same places is fitted  When the ballance falleth.too high, from which the Ballance falleth on both sides, and will not stand just; if you know this, then make the Beam on both sides somewhat lower, but so that it be not higher on one side than on the other; to the rectifying of this, you should have a little smooth plate of Peartree, Image 69 (page 92)  upon which make a Cross stroak, and in the midst of the Cross must be a little Hole, and upon this lay the filed Beam of the Ballance, so that the little Wartz in the little Holes, and the Beam and little Tongue may come to lye upon the stroak, then you may soon see how the Beam, the little Tongue, and the Ends are fitted, that so you may help and fit it. So when the little Beam is thus prepared, that it may stand near the Ends, a little lower than the Line upon the little plate, then lay it in the Fork, in its place; give it the right quickness so that it draw well and distinctly the smallest of the Weights of the Proof-Weights (and not stop in its lodge) nor have too much room (that is to say) that the holes below of the Fork may not stand too far off from the little Wartz, but only that one may see through to try it.  Now, when the Proof-Scales are thus made with To make the Ballance, to stand true.the greatest dilligence, see that it has its quickness, and does not stand; also that there be no fault neither in the Beam or little Wartz, it must stand right both with the scales and also without them, if it doth not this, but goes heavy on the one side and light on the other, there is the greatest fault, which to mend many do not understand; but thus is it to be done, help the Ballance above on the one end, and on the other side on the scale, (that is thus) bend the one end a little down, or a little narrower, then doth it give presently the Ballance on the other side, weight, for the length, and takes so much from the other side of the scale, that the Ballance may stand in again in the Fork, then try it again whether it do well either with a Burthen or without a burthen, and that it may have its right quickness; but if it does not so, but goes still a little at one side, then have you done too much, then help it with bowing back of the end, and the scale; but if you have not bowed the end on the right side, then the Ballance Page 93 will go more false, therefore you may easily see on  which side it is to be helped with binding and fitting them, and you may also use this dilligence, that when you have bent the end on the one side, and that you also do the like on the other side of the scale, but make it even with Weights, that the Ballance may stand right in the Fork, by which you may see how it doth stand in either with Weight, or without, and then it is easily to be corrected. It requires great Pains to fit a Ballance thus, for it doth try many times a Master; yea, it maketh him so err, that he cannot know oft times how further to proceed: yet this way which I have here proposed is the best to such a fittingness: and it must certainly be managed by an ingenuous, and not a dull Soul. Thus much I thought good to signify, for the clearer Instruction, because 'tis very pertinent to our present Discourse of Proving, therefore I omitted it not.  And that the Proof-Ballance may be preserved clean and pure from Dust, and also that in time of use the wind The Case for the Proof Ballance.may be no hindrance, but stand firm, therefore it is to be put in a clean and well formed Proof-Case made of wood, which on both sides is to be set with bright and Or, oyld Paper.clear Glass, that the Light may come into it, and that all things may well be seen (the Form is shewn in the following Sculpture: And, for conveniency of the Sight, it were best to colour the Inside of this Case green, because the Fire is hurtful to the Eyes, and by this colour they are again quickned and refreshed.

XXXVI. How Proof-Weights are to be made and divided, and first of the Grains Pence and Carrat weights.  BECAUSE both the making and parting of the Weights is no small thing, therefore To be made of Silver or Brass.I am obliged further to demonstrate how, and of what such are best to be made: First, it is better they be of good Silver than of Brass, for the Silver daubeth not, neither coloureth it so soon as Brass Page 95 doth, but remaineth all times pure and clean, if  now the Silver be cast into an Ingot, then one may cut out four square pieces in the proportion and bigness (as every piece of Proof-weight shall weigh) heavy or light, and file all such pieces pure and clean, upon a Whetstone, draw them smooth: also every one in particular (in respect of the Division) is with diligence to be put upon the Proof-Balance, that if it be still too heavy, it may be made lighter, and true; and so lastly, it may stand just. But some Provers think one should make and divide the Proof-weights from above, that is from the greatest still to the smallest; again, some from the smallest to the greatest; but know that it is best to be done in the following manner. Weights of a Mark. If Proof-Weights are to be prepared anew, they must  be divided from the greatest to the smallest, for this Reason, Because one may better and more easily have the just and certain weight of a Mark, than of one from the smallest, as from the half-Grain or Heller, and should make a Weight out of it, there the Mark would be either much too heavy or much too light, in which an error is easily committed, Therefore use, in such a dividing from above, a small Grain of seeved and wash'd Copper, by which may be seen how much must be taken away and filed off from a piece, which is yet too heavy; when now such Proof-weight is finished, then  Proof-Weights.shall it be drawn up from below, from the smallest to the greatest with diligence upon a quick and good Proof-Balance, and if there is yet any want, which cannot be great, that it may be compleatly helped. Now, how the Proof-weights, piece by piece are to be divided, may be seen in the IX Chapter of this first Book.   Image 71 (page 96) CHAP. XXXVII. For dividing the Weight of the Centner.  AS the Grain-Penny and Carrat Weights Carrats.may certainly be divided from the highest to the lowest, so it may be done with the Centner-weight, but because in the pounds there are unequal parts, understand it thus, The Centner hath a Hundred pound: the half, 50 pounds: and  �nequal parts.the fourth part, twenty five pounds; and if one would out of it divide sixteen pounds, (which one that is not well skilled in Division may have great labour therein) then you should do thus, when you have made right the Division of the Centner to the fourth part, then weigh the fourth part of the Centner with a proof weight (it may be a Centner or penny-weight) and how much it weigheth, then you may make your account how much sixteen pounds shall weigh: (an example.) I put, the new divided twenty five pounds which do weigh on the penny-weight 13 loths, three drams; then I say, the twenty five pounds will weigh one Mark, thirteen loths, and three drams, which may weigh sixteen pounds, which amounts to nineteen loth, no dram, no penny, one heller, and do prove a little more than a fourth part of a heller, so much then must weigh sixteen pounds, after this weight or sixteen pounds: divide your weight with small grain'd Copper, (the smallest as you are informed before) and although the Centner had more pounds, nevertheless the unequal division of it may likewise be found. Now when the proof weight is all perfected then draw it up likewise with dilligence from the smallest to the Page 97 greatest, as you have done with the other, if there  should be found an Errour, then mend it also, so there will be small Difference, and the Centner will remain in the desired Weight.  But that you may be sure whether the Proof-weights be right and just, set them aside, and make one Proof-weight Whether the Proof-weights are made right;more, as heavy as this, then put the made weights which pertain to a Proof-weight altogether in a quick Proof-Ballance, and weigh them one against the other, and if they stand even together, then you have made them right; if not, and that thou findest them not alike, then look where the Error is, and mend it, for, whoever will be sure of his Weights, must not think much of this Labor.  Lastly, Number and Mark every piece of the Proof-Weight with a small iron or steel Punch, how much each piece doth weigh, by which it may be known: (but the marking must be done after its made smooth on a Whetstone whereby the Shivers which it had from the Stamp may be made smooth again) and lay them into a little clean Box, made on purpose of wood (the form of which is to be seen in the following Sculpture�) in which there must be as many little round or square Holes, as there are weights, then shut the sides that it may be kept from Dust, and that the Weights may remain clean and pure. The Sculpture is thus   Deciphered. 1. The little Case for Weights opened. 2. The same Case shut.  Image 72 (page 98)  Sculpture XIII.   Thus much I was willing to signify and write concerning the Proving of Silver Oars, and what appertaineth to them; and though it had seemed needful to Instruct, How such and every particular Oar according to their Natures and Properties, should be melted and made to more Advantage in the great Fires of Furnaces and Smelting works: yet because, in this Treatise, I have only purposed to write of Proofs in Small Fires, and lesser Ovens, and because these now mentioned works are almost common in the Smelting and great Mine-works: Therefore I am willing to let it rest here; yet some great Works and Meltings, I have mentioned (in this and other Following Books) because thy are not so common, and meerly for the Instruction of other Assayers.  The End of the first Book.   Page 99 OF Golden OARS. BOOK II.   CHAP. I.  THIS Second BOOK describeth how Gold oars are to be known, and how to Roast Boil and Prove them; also of Washing, Purifying and Quickning the Gold Wash-works: and further, how Touch-Needles are to be made, and to Divide the Gold-weights; also to distill Aqua Fortis, and to rectify it: also how Silver and Gold are to be parted by Aqua Fortis and by Fusion; and to make the Gold deft to cement it, and give it an high Colour, and how it must be cast through Antimony, and be brought to its hight with the Ovens, glasses and Instruments which are used to all these.  To know Gold Oars�The Knowledge of Silver-Oars having been now treated of; We proceed to the Gold Oars, (although they are not found in so many Kinds and Colors) which must after their external Modes be known also, together with their proving and ordering of them. But they have this Condition attends them, (as Experience hath taught me) That no Oar hath GOLD only of it No oar by it self Gold�self, without other incorporated Metals) unless it be apparent Image 73 (page 100)  and seen, how small soever it be intermixed with Section.them, and the same Gold, which is thus to be found in these Oars is not wholly pure and clean, but commonly Silvery, although one more than the other.  Gold in Horn Oar.Now, the fair Gold that is found thus Intermixed or commonly standing in a whitish Flint, and sometime in a blew and yellow Horn-stone, and also in a Blew shiffer streamy and yellow iron, but very small and flaming with Gold, and this is found in the Mine at Knein, two miles from the Eal in Bohemia, towards the West, where there is also found a grenish Silvery Flint, in a firm Quarry; and when this is ground and wash'd, then a fair and high Duke Gold comes out of it, which otherwise is not seen in the Flint, at the present: I know no place in Germany, where, out of any Oar, any higher Gold can be made.  Further, all Goldish oars (which are commonly sandy) Gold in Woolfrain. Tin, and Iron Oars.have good Duke gold, yet not all alike, some are gross and in grains� others are flaming and light Gold, and there is almost in all such works a heavy Shurl, ger. Temper (or wolfram wash) especially in Tin and Iron stone, which with the Gold have been driven far by the Deluge, and it is both wonderful and neat, and the work and colour  Why the Rivers carry Gold with them.and difference may easily be discerned, of these sorts: and the Rivers and Channels which do flow over such works are so seeded with it, that Duke gold in many places is found in them, not only in remote Kingdoms and Countryes, but also with us in Germany, it is brought to profit, yet in Germany for the most part it is poor, and cannot bear the charge of Washing.  But some old Writers say, That (out of the River Of the River Nile.Nile in Aegypt, which did flow into the Sea in the time of the Deluge, in which all Sand was brought together) other Rivers and Channels have also been seeded with Duke gold; But, to this I cannot consent, for this Page 101 Reason, Because this River is very great, and goeth  through that part of Ethiopia, (which is called India) in which also is found much Gold, and it is said to be the greatest of all other Rivers, and doth flow the furthest; yet I esteem it much too small to inrich so many Gold-Mines with Gold-sand and channels in so innumerable places of the World.  Grains which are carryed away by Forreigners.There is also with us in Germany all sorts of Grains which are found in many Mountains and Channels, and are carried away by out-landish men; some of them are flinted, in part brown yellow and black, and within like Glass, and in form commonly round, and also square, of which, as 'tis said, Gold is also made: for my part, I esteem such not at all, because I have assayed many times such Grains in the Fire, and other ways tryed, but could not find Gold in them. But thus much I have from very credible Persons, who have assured me, That such Grains have not Gold in them, nor none is made out of them, but by such persons brought far into Italy and other places, for an Addition, out of which fine Colours and Amel is to be made, which colours and Amel by them is thus esteemed and sold dear, as if it were Gold, which also is agreeable to reason and may be believed, especially because many sorts of Mines, with us in Germany, are found which do yield glossy and fine Colours.  Gold in Iron-man Oar.Further, sometimes with the digg'd Gold (which lies in flints, especially in the Gold-Mine at the Eal in the Kingdom of Bohemia) there breaks a small grey spissy Oar, which, after its colour, is called Iron-man, that same also is not only rich in Gold, but 'tis also silvery, therefore it is not to be compared with the other dig'd Gold which standeth in flints. Also there is found much Gold flints which have not only Gold but silver also, and commonly  Gold in flint�more of silver than gold, likewise flints which are very Image 74 (page 102)  copery and silvery, the silver of it is also rich in gold; as also some white flints which have no Copper at all, and but a little silver, and are goldy, but the flints which are coppery, and whose Silver hath Gold are found commonly with small flints intermixed.  Concerning the Marcasite, of which many make Fables, Gold Marcasite.and do write as if it were a meer flint, is very rich in Gold (because it doth not loose the fourth part in the Fire) and in roasting and glowing becomes more and more fine: I have many times diligently enquired after it, but never receiv'd any good account concerning it, much less could I hear of one who had seen such a flint. But, as far as I can comprehend, the Marcasite can and must be nothing else than a very good Gold-oar: Now whether this Name be given it, or any other, it matters not: But how these (one after another call'd Gold-oars and wash'd Works) are to be proved and try'd, shall plainly follow.   CHAP. II. What Proofs and Washings the Gold-washers use in Gold-works.  How much may be wash'd in a day.GOLD-Washers who go abroad in the Country for Gold-washing, and get their Livelihood by it, they have for the Gold-works a special proving, whereby they do observe how much Gold they wash in one day, and accordingly make their Accounts, whether the VVork will bear the charge of Washing, and whether it be poor or rich, and to this Proof they use a particular Weight, which is divided by the weight of an Hungary-Gilder, after the Page 103 worth of so much as is used to pay for such wash-Gold.   But because commonly 92 Creicers are given for an Hungary Gilder weight of wash Gold, therefore they Of Creicers Golden and a Peny-Weight.make forth the greatest weight as high as an Hungury Gilder, and sign it with 92 Creicers, the second piece or half of the weight with 46 Creicers, and so of all the other pieces, one after another, with their Worth, till to the single penny, as followeth,  92 Creicers the weight of a Gilder. 46 Creicers the half Gilder. 23 Creicers the fourth part of a Gilder. 12 Creicers 6 Creicers 3 Creicers 2 Creicers 1 Creicers 2 Penny weight Bohemish Money. 1 Penny weight Bohemish Money.   Of Gold Grains.By these Weights every one may be informed of a grain of Gold, how much it is worth when weighed, therefore commonly the Gold-washers which go into the Lands for such Work carry with them such a Weight, with a black Sichertroegel.Sicher Troy, and a little Box full of Quick-silver, and a soft Leather, a proof Test, and a little Ballance (to all these things pertaining) then as soon as one of them enters upon a sandy or soft Work, and worketh upon it: if he finds Gold in it (how small soever it be) then doth he cleanse a little of it, and doth cause it to enter cleanly into the Quick silver, and doth afterwards press it through the Leather, from it, and that which doth remain in the Leather he puts upon a Proof Test, into the fire, which he doth presently kindle, either in the Image 75 (page 104)  Woods or Mountains and causeth it to go off, and the Gold to be red-hot, and what it doth afterwards weigh according to his Creicer and penny weight, so doth he make his Reckoning, how much of such Oar he can wash and make it return to an account in one day, and so in a Week.  If upon Search he doth find by such proof that the To prepare Boards for Washing it.Wash�work will recompence his labour pains and charges, then each one, according as he is best instructed doth wash the same, and make his profit thereby, among which there are some who do wash that which doth lye in the Fields under the moist earth, as also the Sand out of the flowing Rivers or Channels, and do wash it over a Board, in which are cut little Gutters and wrinkles, here and there, into which the heavy Gold will descend and remaineth; but part of it will wash over, especially if the work be rich and hath grain Gold; but if it doth go slow, it requires more pains.  Some years past, there was found upon such Work A special good wash work�and sand, by the water-side, a special wash-Work by which, in one day near 300 weight of rubbish have been wash'd away, and the Gold saved: which is done thus, There must first be made of Brass Wire a Rattar or  The Bigness of the Rattar.Seeve as wide or narrow as the Work requireth, and it is to be tyed from above downward with Brass wyer, and it must be stretch'd fast upon Iron-stays; that it may not bend or rise, the bigness of the Rattar is to be seven spans long, and five wide, and in depth a good span, with a bottom that doth enter two thirds into the Rattar, and with one third part to be extended for carrying the matter out (which is to be done over with Tin) the Rattar must also have, on each side, little wooden pieces fastned to it, by which he may reach to the foremost Instruments, that the gross matter that doth not go through may easily be emptyed. Page 105  As also the lower bottom under the Rattar must have on each side Boards fastned to it, that nothing may fall from the Rattar, for from that place the Work passeth from the Rattar, upon the flat hearth (which is to be thirty spans in length, and four broad) and the Chanel through which the Water doth run-out must be wider than that above, and also covered-over with Tin: to this there is also Water used more or less, according as the Work is foul or sandy.  This Wash-work serveth only for Sandy-works, but not at all for the clean and deft: yet because this work is not common to this day, therefore (for them that have not seen it) I have delineated it in the following Sculpture, thus   Deciphered. 1. The man that worketh with the Rattar. 2. The middle Floor whereon that which goeth through the Rattar doth fall. 3. The lower Floor whereon that which cometh from the middle Floor doth fall. 4. The Plain Receiver of that which falls from both. 5. The person that stands on a Board, and out of a Wheel-barrow throws the Matter or Oar, into the Tunnel, which guides it into the Rattar. 6. The Channel in which Water doth run into the Rattar.  Image 76 (page 106)  Sculpture XIV.   Then some of the Gold-washers use upon their Of Seircing Gold Oar.hearths the strong Timode black and russet woollen Cloth, over which they do drive their Works, because the woollen cloth is rough and hairy, so that the small and round grains of Gold will remain, and not run forth (as it will from the Timode) whereby the Gold (upon the black Cloth may apparently be known, though it be small and little. Page 107   Others use in stead of the Timode or black woolen Cloaths Linsy-woolsy (half linnen and half woollen; wrought in the manner as the Timode is) upon which the The sorts of cloth to be used for seircing it.Gold doth stick better, and such Cloths do last longer, because of the Linnen that is among the Woollen which doth strengthen it, therefore it is better for this Work.  How to use the long Rattars.But there is another way of Washing (not much in use) which is called Driving and Washing through the long Rattar; but according to my mind, it is not so convenient a way for the small VVorks, which have great and small Gold, and are both sand and Clay together, yet I do not much decline from the before described Rattar-work: For, in this Labor or washing, because of the turning in the upper and lower falls, the running Gold is preserv'd better, and the Gold goeth with the small common Work over the plain hearth, upon which it is driven: and the manner of doing it is seen in the following Sculpture; thus   Deciphered 1. The Miner which caries the matter to be wash'd in the Rattar. 2. The Parts of the Rattar, more visible than in the former Sculpture. 3. The Washer that governs the Rattar. 4. The upper and lower Falls from the Rattar. 5. The plain Boards, or Hearth) on which they fall. 6. He that stirs about the muddy water from both Fallings. 7. The Tub wherein that which falleth from the hearth is to be wash'd.  Image 77 (page 108)  Sculpture XV.   Thus much I was willing in short to discourse about To purify the Gold Slicks.the Gold-Washing, as a Direction how the Work is to be done to Advantage. If now a Work be rich, then it is the better, and then may easily be found and used a manner of Washing, that the loose Gold by it may be preserved: and when the Slick is brought into a narrowness, and the Gold drawn out with the great Instrument, or with the slender and long one (which is called a Page 109 Saxen) then may it be quickned and pressed through  the Leather; then glow out and cast all together, of which more shall be written in what followeth.  Thus far I have spoken of the Gold and Seyfen or Soper.wash-works which do need Boxes: Now I intend to write also of the Gold Oars which are had in the Mines out of the Veins� and how that must be buckt or washt; in which Of great Grain'd gold.the digg'd Gold is clearly to be seen, and such must have a special way of preparing it) namely, those Oars in which the Gold standeth in great Grains, and may be parted with the hand, or beaten in a great Iron Mortar, and, if there be much, then set it over a Seeve, made on purpose, and so cleanse it, and it needeth no more pains, nor greater Art: and it is better than that the Oars (without difference) were brought under the Buck, or washing place (especially because one useth to observe such a hand parting in smaller Mettals, as Silver, Copper and Lead Oars.)  How digg'd Gold is mingled.But the poor Gold Oars which are mingled with small Gold (and cannot be separated with the hand) the same if they can be wrought without Roasting, may be Buck'd and prepared two wayes, viz. by a wet and a dry Bucking or beating; by the wet Bucking is the Oar washed through Tin plates and Channels (and like unto silvery Oar, driven over a plain Hearth, and afterwards made clean) but in the dry beaten Work, the Floor is driven over the plain Hearth with Woollen or Linsy-Woolsy stuff (as above, where the Gold-work hath been taught) and so wash'd and made clean and quickned.  Flinty and Horn stony Gold Oars how to be us'd.There are also Flinty and Horn-stony Gold Veins, in which the Gold is very subtil and thin, and is mingled with other Water-flowing Gold Oars, the best way of preparing them is, That such Flints and Horn-stones, provided there may be had Wood enough in the place, Image 78 (page 110)  may in a special Roast Oven, made on purpose, be burnt: first, very hard and well, and when it standeth in the greatest heat, pour water upon it, that it may cool suddenly, and so the subtil flaming Gold will be, as it were, frighted, at the incorporated Oar, and run together, and become a round Body, and is strengthned and remaineth the better in washing, also 'tis better preserv'd: likewise, the Flint by quenching doth become so brickle, that afterwards in great quantity, it may easily be buckt and separated, and is not so hurtful (after it is roasted) to the tender Gold, as before when it was raw) because the hard Flint among the Gold-Oar doth more hurt in Bucking in respect of its weight, and the muddiness carrieth away some of the Gold with it, in the mudy Water, but seing that it is very rare to find plenty of wood in such places where flinty, Horn-stone Gold Veins are; therefore every one is left to try the best way.  The Roast-Ovens in which those flinty Oars are roasted, Roast ovens.and afterwards quenched with water, make them thus: Give to each Oven two Ells in square, and six Ells high, and cause it to be built up with stones, that the Oven before the lower part may remain, open so high that the roasted Oar may be drawn out of the hole (after the Oar which is to be roasted is put in) then it must be closed up with Clay, also there must be in the Oven, in stead of the roast, Separations, made of Tiles an Ell high, upon which the wood is to be laid, that the Wind may go between the Tyles into the Oven, whereby the fire may burn clear. VVhen you intend to roast in such an Oven, then lay into the Oven upon the Tile-stones, short split wood, two Ells high; upon which put the stony Oar, as gross as it doth come out of the Pit, but the small which are not in very great pieces set along the sides of the Oven� that the great pieces may be in the middle, so that the flame and Page 111 heat of the fire may wind about it, and also the heat  of the fire remain together in the Oven, and force it self through it to the top of the Furnace, and such forand inclosed Heat doth much more than in an open Roast, and when the Roast in the Oven burneth at the fiercest, then must water be poured on it, and be quened suddenly, therefore such a Roast Oven for better Advantage is to be built in such a place where water may  To quench the Roast.easily be poured into it, so the subtil Gold will run together in grains, and the stone will becom brickle (as hath been said before) although the same do become brickle only with burning, yet it becommeth more brickle by quenching, and it is done more especially for the Gold sake. The form of such Roast-Ovens, and how they must stand in its proportion and shape, will be seen in this following Sculpture, thus   Deciphered 1. The Form of the Roasting-ovens. 2. The Shutters to them. 3. The In-side of them. 4. The Partitions in them, made of Tile, and a person atending at the mouth of them. 5. He that pours Water into the top of the Oven. 6. The wood that is used in those Roasting-ovens. 7. The Instruments to close the Ovens. 8. The Ladder to go to the Top of the Oven. 9. The Pieces of Metal that are to be used.  Image 79 (page 112)  Sculpture XVI.   If there be a great quantity of the Gold-stones, then there may be made more Ovens, as also bigger, and according as necessity requireth, regulate them that the Fire may have its full force. Thus much I was willing to mention concerning the Preparation of the Gold Oars: But because I have not from my youth, medled so much in it, as with other Oars, therefore have I shortned my Discourse: and others that know better Methods have their Liberty to inlarge.   Page 113 CHAP. III. Of Gold Slicks�  FURTHER, know also that when the Gold Oars and Gold Slicks are cleansed Of poor Gold slicks.for to quicken: and the Gold drawn out, with the Quick silver, and hath been quickned, yet there will remain from the quickning a Slick, of which some is poor in Gold, and some rich, yet the rich Slicks may be made to pofit and melted like as a rich Silver Oar: But the other common Gold Slicks, especially if they be of the Gold-Mine at the River Eal) are flinty, and that the Centner which hath but a dram of Gold, cannot better be melted than over the raw Slicks into Slackstones; but if the Slicks be not flinty of themselves, then there must be another flint, (which yields much Stone) added to the Slick in melting, and when the Slackstone doth not come out rich in Gold, then add more of such Flints to it, to help the Flint, until a Centner of the Slack-stone doth contain 13 or 14 Drams in Gold, but it must not be wrought by adding more to it, because if it should become too rich in Gold (it is to be feared that) the Slakes would remain too rich: therefore, if there be enough of such flints to be had, let them be added to it, or if the Slick it self be flinty, and yield stones, then 'twere better that the Slack-stone were brought no further in Contents, than to 10 drams of Gold in the Centner, and so the Slack will remain the poorer: thus the Iron flaky Oars (which have very subtil flaming Gold, and commonly the Centner of Image 80 (page 114)  it doth contain a dram or two in Gold) may return to great Advantage.  But the rich Gold Ram or Slick (out of which Gold is quickned) which in part useth to be very rich in Gold that sometimes it doth contain a Centner from three to Of rich slicks.many Loths of silvery Gold, such can no better way be melted than with Lead; yet because that same Slack is very subtil, therefore the blast in melting doth raise it up very easily, so that it doth fly out, and is lost by it: to prevent this, Let the Slick be mingled with strong Yest, and let it dry, then break it into Bits, or before it is quite dry, cut it to small Bits, and put it into the Oven, and so it will remain better in the fire.  To bring both to Profit.'Tis necessary I further direct, That when one hath a Gold Slick, and would melt it, and that a Centner thereof doth hold from two to five drams of Gold, and is not stony in it self, there must be other flints added so that the flint and slick may not be throughly mingled together, nor run upon the slick, for by this there will be danger, because the flint doth spread it self, and gives a little rough stone, whereby there will remain much of the Gold behind, but weigh the flint and the slick, each by themselves, and if any of it be melted, so much (according to the quantity, partly flint and partly slick and slacks) must be set into the melting Oven, and it will fine it self well enough together, and by this means (as Experience teacheth) more row stones and more Gold will be wrought out, than if such slick, flint and slacks had been mingled together, because the work remaineth close together and is not spread.   Page 115 CHAP. IV. How Gold-Slicks with Gold from digg'd Oar are to be prepared.  WHEN the Gold-slicks which do contain Gold are made clean, and there is a desire to make more profit of it, by quickning and getting the Gold out of them, then the slicks must first be prepar'd in the following manner: viz. Take good strong Wine Vinegar, put into every gallon half a pound of Allum, cause it to boyl up a little, and then let it cool, then put the Gold-slicks in a clean prepared Vessel, and pour the prepared Vinegar upon it, that it may cover the slicks, let it stand two or three nights in it, and work well upon it, so the Vinegar will make a fresh ground to the flamy Gold, that it will not easily enter into the Quick silver, and that which is yet among it of deft Oar will become slimy, and the Gold is made less, and when the Vinegar hath stood the mentioned dayes over it, then separate the Vinegar clear from it, and wash the slicks clean and fair with warm water, and let it dry, then put it in the grinding Tub or wooden Vessel, and so much Quick-silver to it as the quantity of the Gold in the slicks doth require, and rub it well together with the hands, afterwards with a wooden Pestel, fitted for it, grind it well and so long, till the Quick silver hath taken up all the Gold; when this is done, then pour warm water upon it, and wash the slicks and Quick silver clean, and pour out the muddy matter, and the Quick silver will run together again: Image 81 (page 116)  which must be separated very clean from the slicks, that nothing remain behind, because it is more Goldish: when this is done, dry it with a spunge; and put it in a double strong Timode or into a fine leather (which is  To press the Quick silver through Leather.better) and force it with a strong Coard so as the Quick-silver being so prest will pass through such Timodes or leather, and the Gold with almost as much Quick-silver will remain in the Leather; put this on a flat Test upon a coal fire, and the remaining Quick silver will cooperate and the Gold will remain alone; then glow it well and melt it together before the Bellows with Borax, so long till it doth hold the wind, then pour it into an Ingot: The prepared Vinegar (as hath been said) with Allom, is for the most part used by all Refiners, but they quicken Gold only simply with slick, but 'tis better that such Vinegar be prepared and used.  When the Gold h""lds Silver.But if the Gold be a little silvery (as commonly wash Gold is"

Image 2 (unnumbered page) Unnumbered page TO HIS EXCELLENCY Arthur Capell, Lord Lieutenant and General Governour of the Kingdom of IRELAND, Earl of Essex, Vicount Maldon, Lord Capell, Baron of Hadham, Lord Lieutenant of Hartfordshire, and one of the King's most Honourable Privy Council, &c. May it please your Excellency, DID I not very well know your great Understanding in, and Love to the Subject of the ensuing Discourse, I durst Image 3 (unnumbered page) not assume the Boldness to implore your Honours Patronage of it; But being well assured, that you have not been onely a Spectator, but an Actor in most of what is treated of in the ensuing Lines; for, to your Eternal Prayse be it spoken, there is many a fine Tree which you have Nursed up from Seeds sown by your own hands, and many thousands more which you have commanded me to raise. Therefore, my Lord, I humbly crave your Pardon for the Presumption and Imperfection of the Pen-man; and though your Excellency knows full well how to prune young Trees, yet I hope you will pass by the impertinent and superfluous Lines in this my Plantation; which, though I have endeavoured to keep as well pruned from Errors, and as clean from Weeds as I could, yet 'tis possible there may be some things in it, which Unnumbered page some may term as ill: But to You all things in it are so well known, that I hope both it and I shall find such shelter and support by your favourable Aspect, as that we need not to fear the Storms of the ignorant or negligent Planters. And my Lord, since the Art of Raising and Improving of Trees, hath ever been esteemed amongst the truly Noble, Wise, Ingenious and most refined Spirits of the World from Age to Age, and chiefly maintained and practised by them; and since this Property is Naturally inherent in You, (you being not onely a great Lover of this Art, but also most skilfull in it) I humbly presume to Dedicate these my Observations to your Lordship; not being ignorant, that he who is most knowing in any thing, is the best able to judge of the same; and that this my Opinion, of your Honours Ability and Promptitude in promoting the Planting and Improving Image 4 (unnumbered page) of Forrest-trees, is surely grounded, the Large Plantation you have made will abundantly testifie. But I humbly beg your Lordships Pardon for this Presumption, not without hopes that my good Meaning may obtain it; and since my good Wishes and the best of my Services is all I can contribute to You, these shall never be wanting from My LORD, Your Excellencies most Humble and most Obedient Servant to serve You whilest I bear the Name of Moses Cook.   Unnumbered page TO The Courteous READER. AMongst the many Books that are sent into the world in this Age, I have adventured to increase the Number by this one. I know there be many Pamphlets, prodigious Histories and Romances, invented by mens Fancies, which abuse many Noble Spirits, in reading of which they spend their time in vain, and dull their Wits: Which Books are more fit for Women than Men. For they will furnish them with strange Stories, and a few fine words. Also there be many Books of Disputes in Divinity, which tend more to make our Differences the greater, than any wayes to edifie or unite us: therefore if your Genius leads you to read such Books, this is not for your Fancy. But if you take delight in Planting or Gardening, or to raise and improve Forrest-trees, or to make Walks, Avenues or Lawns; to plant or improve your Woods, Hedges, &c. or to measure most sorts of superficial or solid Figures, either by Arithmetick or Geometry, with several other Rules of the same Nature, as the Titles of each Chapter, (but especially the Chapters themselves) will more fully inform you; then I hope this Book will be of good use to you: For here are several Rules, approved of by several Noble and Ingenious Men, which are as faithfully delivered, as they are really intended for the good of this Nation, Image 5 (unnumbered page) and all those that will put them in practice; which if you please to doe, you will employ your time so well, that you will never have cause to say, it is ill spent; and if once you do but step forward one step, and see but any success of your Labours, you will need then no Logicians Arguments, nor no Rhetoricians Eloquence to perswade you to proceed. And for your better Encouragement know, that it hath been and is the Delight and Practice of Kings, Princes, Philosophers, and all Noble spirited and wise Men: For have not many of them quitted their great Employs, and taken upon them this pleasing Art of Planting and Gardening, as is proved by several? See the Prefaces of Perkinson's, Gerard's, the Curate of Henonville's, and several others. For Almighty God hath Imprinted in the Hearts of most wise men such a Love to Plants in part, as their Father Adam had in his state of Innocency; that those noble and usefull Works, which the Almighty made for the use of Man, and his Glory, should be the more common for their excellent use to the Sons of Men; and that they should take care of those which are tender, and want the more care, lest they should be lost; and also that both their Vertues and their Beauties should be known in several parts of the World, that he might be the more Admired and Glorified. For I do believe that the Blessing of God is much Assisting to those who Love and endeavour to Improve and Preserve his Works; for God's Works and his Word are no such different things; and also it hath been and is observed, that those that are Wasters and wilfull Spoylers of Trees and Plants without just Reason so to doe, have seldom prospered in this World. See this confirmed by Esquire Evelyn, in his Preface to his Discourse of Forresttrees. Therefore, you that are Lovers of Trees and Plants, if once you have them, let your Love be shewed in the Care you take of them, to keep them from Cattel and Unnumbered page other Inconveniencies, then will you not onely have Pleasure and Profit of them, but others, by being defended from the malignant and sharp Air by their Heads and Bodies, and also shaded from the violent Heats, and their sweet Flowers, and their refreshing Fruit will be usefull to several men. Also Planting and Gardening addes much to the Health and Content of Man; and these two Jewels, no man that well understands himself, would willingly be without: For it is not onely set down for a certain Truth by many wise Men, but confirmed by Experience. The Learned Lord Bacon commends the following of the Plough in fresh Ground, to be very healthful for Man; but more the Digging in Gardens, saying, It is best to take the Air of the Earth new turned up by Digging with the Spade, or standing by him that diggeth: He tells you also that he knew a great Man, that lived long, who had a clean Clod of Earth brought to him every Morning as he sate in his Bed, and would hold his Head over it a good pretty while, &c. See pag. 203. of his Natural History. For though the Earth be two-fold, External or Visible, and Internal or Invisible; the External is not the Element, but the Body of the Element, in which is the Sulphur, Mercury and Salt; for the Element of the Earth is Life and Spirit, wherein lies the Astra's of the Earth which bring forth all growing things; for it hath in it self the Seeds and seminal Vertues of all things; for as it is made fruitfull by all the other Elements, so it bringeth forth all things out of it self, as Trees, Herbs and Flowers; and every one of these is again the Astrum and Seed: See Philosophy Reformed, p. 38. Thus is shewed, that the Earth hath in it the Virtues of all Herbs; it must then be also healthful as they be: But for that part of the Earth that is neer the Surface, the Plants suck most of its Virtue into them; therefore that which lieth deeper may be the more healthfull for Man to smell of Image 6 (unnumbered page) for Consumption, Loss of Appetite, &c. And Trees do not onely catch the Mildew and other offensive Dews with their Leaves, but screen the Aire of other bad ones, and makes it much the healthfuller for Man. Therefore, you that live neer to Fenns, Moors, and other unhealthfull places, plant your Seats round with Trees, and some of those that yield healthfull smells: For it is very certain, what the aforesaid Learned Author saith, p. 204. That Odours do Nourish; for he saith, he knew a Gentleman that would fast three or four dayes, without Meat, Bread or Drink, by onely smelling to a great wisp of Herbs, &c. And in p. 44. in the History of his Life and Death, saith, That Odours are especially profitable for the Comforting of the Heart: And further he saith, We commend above all other Odours, that of Plants growing and not plucked, taken in the open Aire, as Violets, Gilly-flowers, Pinks, Bean-flowers, Line-tree Blossoms, Hony-suckles, Wall-flowers, Roses, Mints, Lavender, &c. Orange-trees, Citron, Mirtles, &c. Therefore to walk or sit neer the breath of these Plants, would not be neglected. Thus you see this Learned man takes notice of the Line-tree; and if the simple Water that is distilled from the Flowers, be good against the Plague, or other infectious Diseases, as certain it is, then sure the smell from the Blossoms themselves must be very good; therefore excellent to plant neer your Houses: And (as I have heard) a wise Mans Opinion was, That the Line-trees in the Cities in Holland adde much to the Health of the Inhabitants; and it is my belief. I have hinted at the bigness of one Lime or Line-tree, in the ensuing lines, and shall here shew you, for your further encouragement to plant and preserve Trees, the Content of one Tree, as I had it from the Honourable Sir Henry Capell as followeth.  Unnumbered page A Witch-Elm in Sir Walter Baggott's Park in the County of Stafford. Two Men five dayes felling it. It lay 40 yards in Length. The Stool five yards two foot over. Fourteen Load of Wood brake in the fall. Forty eight Load in the Top. Eighty pair of Naves were made out of it. Eight thousand six hundred and sixty foot of Boards and Planks. It cost Ten pounds seventeen shillings Sawing. The whole Substance was conceived to be 97 Tuns. It was felled in the Year 1674.  And now I shall set before you some Rocks, which are in some Books, and for their strangeness are entertained too long, to the Abuse of many: But these which I mark here, pray endeavour to avoyd. First Error: It is affirmed by some, that if you put your Seeds in a Box, Shell, or Squill, and so set them in the Ground, these seeds will unite in one, and so bring forth larger and better Fruit; but if they should joyn in Roots or Branches, that will not make the Fruit the better or larger, nor of two kinds in Taste, as some have said. I rather think that putting seeds into such things will stupifie them and destroy them; but if they should unite in one shoot, that shoot that groweth the fastest would lead all the sap into its Head, and so strain it through its Pores, that it would make no more Alteration of a Fruit, that such a shoot would Naturally have had, than a Graft doth by being grafted on several stocks. For what Alteration there is of Plants, it is from their Seed, and is stamped in them at their first Conception and Image 7 (unnumbered page) Nativity, which the Art of Man helpeth and may improve somewhat, but never to alter the Kind, by Budding, Grafting, &c. I shall not trouble you and my self in Answering these following Errors; but if you be not satisfied with my saying they are so, I shall answer them when you desire me, as well as I can: So I shall onely name them, and shew you them as I have found them. Second Error: To water Seeds with coloured water; or Plants, to make them produce what coloured Flowers or Fruit you please; It is in vain to think so. Third Er. To graft or bud Stone-Fruit, or Kernels, or Nuts, or to bud such Fruit as beareth Kernels on such as beareth Nuts or Stones; or to bud Fruits-trees on Forrest, and the contrary; or to graft or bud Figs on Peaches, or Apricocks; or to bud any sort of Trees on Coleworts; or to bud Peaches on the Mulberry-tree to have them Early; or to bud Damsons on Gooseberry, Mulberry or Cherries, to have them Ripe all Summer; or by budding Cherries on these Stocks, and to wet them in Honey and Cloves, makes them taste sweet and spicy; or by budding or grafting, to make a Fruit taste half an Apple and half a Pear, or half a Pippin and half a Pearmain; or an Apple half-sweet, half-soure; or to graft a Rose on a Holly; or to graft Cherries on other Stone-fruit to come without Stones; or to graft a Vine on a Cherry; or to take the Pith out of two Grafts, and then joyn them together and graft them, brings a Fruit without Kernels, so they may when both grow; or to graft a Cyon with the small End downward, will make it bring a Fruit without Core: These, and the like, are great Errors, and very false in Grafting and Budding. Fourth Er. To set a whole Apple or Pear, the Pippins will come forth in one shoot; or to set any sort of Fruit with the fleshy part on; are also great Errors. Unnumbered page Fifth Er. To bore holes in Trees, and to put Honey or other sweet things into them, to make them bear more and sweet Fruit; is also a great Fallacy. Sixth Er. To think that the Sap of Trees at the Approach of Winter falleth from the Head into the Root, is a gross mistake. Many more there are which I could count up; but these are too many, either to be written or kept in Memory. Thus having shewed you some Errors, I here beg Pardon for mine own that are in this Book. I know I have committed Tautology; the Reason is, I have been long in taking true Observations: but I hope that which is so usefull, cannot be too often repeated. I have used Arithmetick the more, because it is so usefull to the ingenious Planter; for I have not laboured to please my self onely, but for all those that seek Wisdom: For the Gifts of God are improved by communicating, and Knowledge thriveth as Ingenuity is improved and communicated: for Ingenuity hath these Properties of Memory and Charity, the more you use it, the better it is; and the more you give of it, the more you shall have. And now I shall shew you how I did proceed in that which I was born to, not made: I alwayes took Notes of what I did set or sow, the Time, and on what Ground, &c. and when it proved well, I noted it so; but when ill, I did endeavouras much as I could to know the Reason; which when once I found, I noted it well: I also alwayes was very wary of taking things upon trust; for many Learned men have abused their Works by so doing; and if any man told me any thing, unless he had sufficient Experience of it, or could give very good Reasons why it was so, I alwayes was incredulous of it, unless my Judgement told me it were possible, or he by Discourse made it plain to me: For no man ought to deprive another Image 8 (unnumbered page) of the Liberty of Humane Ingenuity, that hath Light of Nature to discern and judge by. I have often been blamed by Noble-Men, for not consenting to the Opinion of some of their Favourites; for when their Notions were not grounded on Reason, or had not been proved by Experience, (though never so new) I could not well entertain them. So if you find any thing in these few Lines, that hath not Reason in it, prove by Experience whether it is true or not: And do not say, It is so or so, because I say it; but as you find it. And let me be plain with you further; alwayes when I undertook any difficult business, I was as carefull as I could be, to elect a fit time to begin that business in: And to the prayse of God I speak it, I alwayes had the greatest success in my greatest undertakings, though many times I have been altogether Ignorant in them; and many times failed in small things, when I thought of the least danger. I know some will smile at this Truth, but let them laugh that win; I never lost by it. The wisest man that ever was, tells you, There is a Time for all things; and certainly there is in Sowing, Grafting and Gardening: For it shall be my Opinion, To think and judge as cause I find, My Rule is not anothers Mind. Or as the ingenious Mr. Cowley hath it from the Learned Dubartas: Senseless is he who (without blush) denies, What to sound Senses most Apparent lies; And 'gainst Experience he that spits Fallacians, Is to be hiss'd from Learned Disputations; And such is he that doth affirm the Stars To have no force on these Inferiours. Unnumbered page But to conclude; I have here shewed you some Rules how to prune Forrest-trees, which well done adds much to their shape, growth, and long life; Every one that makes any Observation of Trees seeth this truth confirmed in their sshape; and though many are against pruning of Forresttrees, yet it adds much to their growth; and if done by a skilful hand and at fit times, it adds much to the goodness of the Timber, though several (it's possible) will tell you to the contrary, for it is the borrower that things of trust, that is Truth's greatest greatest Opposer: But to confirm the growth by pruning, take this Example: There grew a young Oak near the Orange-house at Cashiobury, about nine inches Diameter, with many young Boughs on the sides, which robbed the Head so much, that it did shoot but little, having more boughs than the Roots could well maintain, I took off the side-boughs in the year 1669; and in the year 1675, My Lord ordered me to fell it, it standing too near a Walk we had made. My Lord being at Cashiobury and discoursing of pruning Forrest-trees with the ingenious Artists Sir Samuel Moreland and Hugh May Esquire, I shewd them the Truth confirmed in this Tree; for that year it was pruned it did grow V of an Inch, which was near as it had grown in five years before; It continued that growth very near for the six years after, as did plainly appear by Annual Circles to them and me. And as good Pruning doth help the growth of Trees, so also it doth prolong their Life: For it is well known that the pruning of some Annual Plants will make them live more years than one; for good Pruning may take off that which ill pruning hath left, or the wind, which otherwise would destroy the Tree in little time. And as I have said something in this Book of Pruning Forrest-trees, so I wish some able man would shew some Rules, or his Judgement of Pruning all sorts of Fruit-trees and Plants that bear Fruit, that there might be some light for a man to see to ground Image 9 (unnumbered page) his Reasons on; for we are much to seek both in the manner how, and the Time when to Prune our Fruit-trees, both to Improve them and their Fruit. I also have shewed you several Rules of Artificial Arithmetick by the Canon of Logarithms, and several Rules of the Line of Numbers or Gunters Line; which for their excellent uses cannot be made too common, or too well known to the Ingenious. And Lastly, I have not bushelled my Light, but have set it to the Publick view; which if it enlighten thee in the good and true way which I intend, to thy benefit and pleasure, it's possible I shall doe thee, if the Lord permit, some other piece of service, farther to direct thee in the Truth. My request to thee is to Correct the mispointing, or paging, for my business is such, that I cannot see it Corrected my self, but trusting in your goodness shall conclude: Small faults if you'l pardon, and some amend, Then I'le be yours to my Lifes end; From Cashiobury near Watford, Novemb. 16. An. 1675. M. Cook.    Page 1 CHAP. I. Of the several Wayes of Raising Trees: The best for Forrest-trees is by their Seeds, Keyes, or Nuts, &c. YOu may raise most sorts of Trees by Laying; the Ash being one of the worst, of any I have experienced: but it will take by Laying; if you be an observer of the growth of the Ash, you then may read the Reason plainly, if that you keep but the eyes of your Understanding open, which I take to be this: Of all the Trees that I know, an Ash shoots with the straightest shot from his Seed, and so continues till it comes to a great heighth, unless by accident; therefore seldom touching the ground by its own growth: But if it should, it having no Arms to defend it against Cattel, and they being great lovers of the tops and leaves, prevent its natural Increase that way, finding it self rarely or never encreased by this kind of propagation, it being not accustomed to Laying, therefore the harder to grow. Your Oak will grow of Laying, so will your Elm very frequently, as I have seen in several Hedges, without any thing of Art: As you may see the great leaved Elm thrive well of a Layer on a bank by the Roadside from Ware to the Right Woshipfull Sir Thomas Leventhorps house called Blacks-Ware. It is worth your noting, to increase this usefull wood in your Hedges; as also other sorts of Wood, which will be much for your profit, and also a great improvement to your Fence, though it be at present altogether neglected. Of the manner and several wayes of Laying, see the Fifth Chapter. 2. Several sorts of Trees will grow of Cuttings; the Manner and Time I shall shew in the succeeding Chapter. But let me now invite you when you fell your Woods, to give some of these Cuttings Quarters in the Naked places, and you shall find them afterwards to pay you well for their Board: Remember your Hedges also where they want Guests to furnish them. You may raise many sorts of Trees by the Roots, or part of Roots Image 10 (page 2) of other Trees: The Kinds and Manner are shewed hereafter, which if you love your Woods and your self, you may take notice of. 3. Many sorts of Trees may be increased on other Stocks by Budding or Grafting, but this is more proper for Fruit-trees than for your Forest: For take it for granted, that it hinders the aspiring growth of Trees, and makes them bear more. I know my Lord Bacon tells you of Budding the Elm, and it will have greater leaves than ordinary: It is likely, if you bud the great-leaved Elm upon the small-leaved whilest it is young and full of sap, it will have larger leaves, especially than an old tree; but that I judge signifies little. Enquiry may be made, whether by budding the Elm and also the Linetree, if it would not make their seeds keep better than they do many years with us: I wish it were tryed. As for the manner of Budding and Grafting, I referre you to other subjects, for there are many have written largely thereof. 4. The last and best way to raise your Forrest-trees, is by their Seeds; and how to do that, I shall shew you in every particular Chapter, by me experienced. I wish every Noble-man or Gentleman that takes delight in these stately Monuments, would follow the Example of the Right Honourable, and very much knowing in these Lines, the Earl of Essex, who hath now several thousands of my Raising. Let me be bold to tell you, that one Ash-tree raised in a Nursery, and ordered as is hereafter shewed, is worth five taken out of a VVood. For there you shall have them grow taper and strong, so that when you remove them, cut but off some of the side-boughs, and set them with great hopes of a stately Timber-tree. But if you take them out of a VVood, then will they be not so well rooted, nor taper, but top-heavy; therefore you must be forc'd to take off the Heads before you set them, and then expect at best but a good Pollard; and it is possible you may wait long before you get him to thrive: For the head being taken off, leaves such a wound which is long a curing; which you must doe, or else his Roots will not maintain that Head. Ever let me advise you to be as sparing in taking off the leading top-shot of an Ash or VValnut as you can possible. Thus have I shewed the several wayes to raise Trees; for the performing of the same, read hereafter; and this is certain, that a few of your Trees raised in a Nursery, are much better than those you take out of VVoods. My Lord was a little before I came to him at some Charge more than ordinary to raise some Oaks: Their way was to fence in a great Oak in the Park, and then digged the ground; and when the Acorns were most of them down, then they raked them in: By this Page 3 Husbandry, my Lord had got eight young Oaks about six year old: I perswaded his Honour to take up his Fence, satisfying him we should raise them at a much cheaper lay. He therefore ordered me to take up these Oaks very carefully: I having two Men then at work with me, I bid the elder goe and take up these Oaks, but could not get him to goe by no means; he also had possest the other with such a tragical story, that I could not perswade him; which was, that there were few which took up an Oak, but either they or it dyed in a little time after. I told them that it was possible the Oaks might die in a short time, but they never the sooner. The Reason may be the same with that before, of raising an Ash by laying: It being not used to be removed, makes them the more difficult to grow when they are. But I went and took up my eight Trees, and lost Six of them the Winter following. Had they been taken up at two years growth, and the tap-root cut, you afterwards might remove them with little danger. I judge, if you can, it will not be amiss to save your Acorns or seeds of this Tree that hath been removed.   CHAP. II. How to observe and know the Nature of Seeds, so as the better to raise them. I Ever observed the shape, taste, skin or shell, that my Keyes, Nuts, Stones, Kernels, or Seeds had; and if I found by their shape, they were pory, and by feeling spongy, tasting little or very mild; I then did conclude to sowe these sorts of Seeds as soon as they were ripe, or as soon at least as I received them; which if they were kept but a little after the time of their being ripe, I then expected but little success of those Seeds. To give you a taste of this Novelty, observe but these few among many more, that is, the Elm, Sallow, Popler, &c. and Angelico, Paspere, or Garden Samphire, Scosanara, &c. I know 'tis a Tradition, that the Elm and Sallow have no seeds: Then how could I raise several of them of Seeds, as I have done? But if you will not believe me, I pray you ask the Earl of Essex, or several others therefore. Be gone Tradition, never more appear, Out of the Kallendar before next year. Image 11 (page 4) Truth with Experience through this Nation Shall Sainted be by a right Observation. Leave room Astrologers for Truth, and see You write it next year in your Diary. Now those Seeds that are of Taste mild, Skin or Shell close, you may keep them till the Spring approach, and longer, if temperately dryed; and dry, keep as your Acorns, and your Chesnuts, &c. but the Spring after they be gathered is a sure season to sow them, therefore deferre no longer. But as for your Seeds that are of a hot or bitter taste, or have close skins or shells, you may keep them till the Autumn following after they be gathered, if occasion be, if they be ripe gathered and dry kept, so the fleshy part be clean taken off when that is ripe: Though I know an ingenious person did hold, that to sow them with their flesh on, (as Peaches or Cherries,) they would grow as well, as he said; but that was his mistake: For the fleshy part was ordained by the Almighty for the use of Man, Beasts or Birds, and tends nothing to the growth of the Seed or Stone, but rather to its dissolution, by stupefying it, as I have tryed by sowing the Kernels of rotten Pears and Apples, which would not grow though but a little time rotten. There be many Stones, Keyes and Seeds which be of a hot and bitter taste, as your Ash, Peaches, Almonds, the Mizerion, Mustard-seed, &c. yet though I say they may be kept long, yet I advise you not to neglect your season; for many of these Seeds and others will lie near two years in the Ground before they come up: if you sowe them in October, it will be the Spring come Twelve-months before they come up; and if you sow them Early in the Spring, they then will come up the next Spring. Another way whereby you may know Seed of this Nature, is, by their long hanging on the trees: for there, Nature finding it self strong, taketh the less care to seek out early to preserve its kind, and also Almighty God hath made these very usefull for the Creatures in this world, therefore hath ordered it thus by his Divine Providence. The Ash, Holly, &c. hang long on the tree, and lie long in the ground, the Elm, Sallow, Sycamore, fall soon, and come up soon.   Page 5 CHAP. III. The Shape of Seeds and their Weight do Inform you how to set them. THe very Form and Shape of Seeds hath instructed me how to set them: as an Acorn falls to the ground most with its small End downwards: Thus if they fall upon Mold or Moss, you may observe the most of them to be on one side, with the small end tending most to the Earth. And I suppose that this posture is the best for to set any Stone or Nut, if you will be curious: For if you observe any Seed, of what Tree soever it be that grows in England, first it puts forth a Root at the small End, and when that Root hath laid hold of the Ground, then it puts forth the shot for the tree at the very same place where the Root came. Then seeing that both Root and shoot put out at the small End, if set with the small End downwards, the Body of the Stone or Seed may hinder the shoot; so that it is the best way to lay them on their sides in the Ground: if they be heavy seeds you may sow them the deeper, as Acorn, Peach, Apricock, Walnut, Chesnut, &c. about two or three Inches deep. If light Seed, then cover them with but little Mold, as the Elm, &c. as � an Inch deep. To conclude then, lay the flattest side of your Seed downwards; as if it be a Peach stone, set it as it will lye on a Table, or the like, and it will lie with the Crack where the shell parts uppermost, and the other crack lowermost to let out the water, as I judge; for Kernels in Stones or Shells do not love too much water at first. Thus have I shewed you the several wayes to raise Trees: That is, how they may be raised, and how to know the time, at least to assist you to know the time to set them by their shapes, &c. as also how to set them the best way by their Form and Weight, which may be some assisting to you, if you meet with far-Countrey seeds. My Lord had thirteen sorts of strange seeds sent him, as I remember from Goa: I never saw the like, nor none that saw them here. By the help of those aforesaid Reasons, I raised ten of the thirteen sorts, though some of them lay almost a year in the ground: But I also must tell you I lost all my ten sorts the first Winter, but one sort, and that the second, for want of a Green-house: some of them I suppose were Annuels. I Image 12 (page 6) shall give you one Chapter more of Seeds, and then I will shew you fully what as yet I have but named. O great Jehovah, thee I doe adore, Thy works I do admire, and thee implore So to assist me, as that I may write With Solomon's Wisdom, that I may indite My few lines so that they may be �sefull unto this Land, pleasing to thee.   CHAP. IV. Observations of all sorts of Keyes and Seeds. LEt your Keyes be through-ripe, or when you find them to begin to fall much, which is a sure sign of any Fruit or seeds Ripeness, (unless by accident) gather them off some young, straight, thriving tree: My reason of gathering them from off a young thriving tree, is� then will your Keyes or seed be the larger and solider; therefore by consequence they be the abler and likelier to shoot the stronger, and to maintain themselves the better: And I know by Experience, that the seeds gathered of old Plants or Trees, or old seeds, so the seeds be perfect, will come up somewhat sooner than the seed of young Trees: my aforesaid Reason doth this somewhat demonstrate; or take it thus, Nature finding her self weak in these Seeds, doth (like a provident Mother) seek the sooner to provide for her weak Children; as a great Philosopher and Naturalist saith, That Nature is one in divers things, and various in one thing. See Parad. pag. 90. of the Tree of Life. And to gather them off a straight and thriving tree, 'tis likelier they will run more up, and grow straighter than those which be gathered of Pollards. This I know, that Nature doth delight very much in Imitation, and in Plants and Trees like doth endeavour to produce its like: though I know, that by the scituation, or ground, or grafting of some sort of Stocks, that by any of these the trees may and will alter something, both in growth and largeness of Fruit, and earlyer, or the contrary, but the species will be still the same. To which I adde, good keeping or dressing of any tree, doth much improve its growth, and largeness of Fruit or Seeds. Page 7 Now the Seed being that part of the Plant which is endowed with a Vital Faculty to bring forth its like, it contains potentially the whole Plant in it, therefore it may and is the more to be observed: Or as a learned Physitian hath it, speaking of Man and the World; The Chaos or first Matter was made a World, and of this World was made Man: so a Tree groweth from the Seed, the Seed is the beginning of the Tree, and in every grain or seed of a Tree there lies hid another three. See Philosophy Reformed, page 58. The Industrious Farmer or Yeoman will take care that the Grain which he soweth be of the best Kind for Largeness and Goodness in every particular, and hath oft found by Experience to his loss, that the Corn which is taken to sowe from that which was your smooted or mill dew'd, doth oft produce smooted or black Corn again; he knowing also that this black Corn which is like dust within, will not grow: Then what should be the Reason that that which growes in the same Ear will oft-times produce black smooted Corn, that hath nothing but a little black dust in it, or a black flinty Kernel of little or no use, but harmfull to the rest, though that which you sowe seem sound, and a very likely berryed Corn? When I have found by Experience, that Wheat which hath not been so likely to the Eye as that which was freer from smooted Corn, hath brought or produced clearer Corn by much than the others. Now I have discoursed with some which would not spare to say positively, that your smooted or black Wheat would grow, and so produce black Wheat again, which is a great Mistake: But this I know, that your Wheat which is like black dust within, will not grow at all; nor some of your black flinty Wheat, but some of it will produce blades, some stalks, with ears, but no sound grain; some with good and bad in one ear, and so the nearer it is to perfect sound grain, the nearer it produceth its like: Yet though this may and will produce some good and some bad, as I say, yet no black smooted grain (unless meeting with some accidental Cause, if the Grain be perfect sound) but according to its defect so may be the success of your Crop. Now this which I call the Accidental Cause, is the Mildew, which may well be so called, because of its Malignity, especially to Wheat and Hops, because in them most perfected though many other Plants suffer as much: This Maldew or Mildew, is a Dew which is drawn from the Earth and Herbs in a drye and calm time, and when Herbs are in their prime, by the Sun; and wanting wind to fan off their grosness, and also being drawn from Herbs, which make it thick and sweet, and not so active to aspire: 'tis most in your inclosed Grounds and Valleys: and to those grounds which lie tending to the Oriental part of the Heavens, as all Blasting winds are. Image 13 (page 8) Now I suppose these may be the Reasons your Valleyes do afford more moysture than your Hills, as is oft seen by your Mists which are more frequent in them than on Hills: this being drawn up by the Sun in the Day-time, and wanting wind to assist its Motion (as I said before) doth hang in the lower Region, and when the Sun sets, it falls upon your Plants with its thick clammy substance; and in those whose bark is tender and young, and pores open with the heat of the season, hinders the sap of the Plant or Tree to ascend to nourish his flowers or shoot. 'Tis observed, that when your Wheat doth shoot up to Ear and flower, it doth it suddenly, and likewise your Hops, and then this Clammy or Mildew coming upon it before the Air hath hardned it, to resist it; For the Air being warm, Nature doth not so much as dream of this unkind Enemy: And if it falls on Wheat when the Ear is new formed, then there is the black smooty Wheat; but if the Ear hath blown even when or before it comes, or that the whole stalk be not surrounded with it, then you shall have some of your grains good, and some bad, according as they were in setting, or find Nourishment. I have oft observed in your black Heart, white Heart, and other great-leaved Cherries, this Dew to fall upon them at the top, just at the beginning of Midsommer shoot, and hath so stopped the shoot, that it hath shot forth in other places below; and on the top of the shoots you may see many little Flies feeding on this Dew; and on the Leaves of Oak and Maple, 'tis plainly to be seen and tasted; and though destructive to Corn, &c. yet it is mighty Relief to the industrious Bees. The Reason why those grounds which hang from the Horizon to the East, are most subject to this Dew, and to Blasting, as it is termed, may be (as I judge) the Suns drawing these vapours towards it; just as a great Fire draweth the Air in a Room to it so the Sun having set these in Motion, yet not having strength enough to draw them into the middle Region, to form them into a Cloud, doth yet draw them till he is below our Horizon, then these Dews tend to the Earth from whence they were taken, and in motion to the West do as it were fall upon that Ground which hangs Eastward at right Angles, therefore offensive to them most. But since I am speaking of this usefull Grain Wheat, I shall take notice of that which I know is used with good success: They take their Seed-wheat, and steep it twenty or twenty four hours in water and Salt, which is found by experience to do good to the Wheat against the blackness, and helps it in its growth; the Reasons I conceive are these: The steeping it prepares it for its spearing, and makes it take root the sooner; Page 9 therefore if late in sowing, steep the longer; if early, not so long: And if there be any Grain that is not perfect sound, this will either kill or cure it. And I suppose that Brine to Wheat, is as Sack to a young Child, a little doth a great deal of good; but have a care you do not let it lie too long in a strong Brine, lest you stupifie it, or kill it with too much Kindness. I do advise my Countrey-men, if late in sowing any of their Grains, to steep especially Barley, as well as Wheat; if your Grain be spear'd, it is never the worse, provided you sow it before the spear be chill'd or dryed; therefore commit it to the Ground, and cover it as you can. Your Wheat, Oats, and Barley differ much in their growth from other seeds; for they put forth their roots at the great end, and then one blade or long leaf at the small end, which comes between the skin and the body of the seed. Your Beans and Pease put forth their Root at the side, and then the same sort of Leaf, at the same place where the Root came out, that grows on the stalks. So doth your Walnut, Chesnut, Horse-Chesnut, Peaches, Almonds, Apricocks, Plumbs, &c. and the onely difference from Beans and Pease, is, that these Stone-fruits put forth at the small ends, and the other alwayes at the sides. In like manner there be several sorts of Trees, and most sorts of Plants that be small, which put forth Root at the small end; and as soon as that Root hath laid hold of the ground, they then send out two false Leaves, nothing like those that grow on the Tree or Plant, which two false Leaves are the seed, which divides into two parts, and so stand some small time on the top of the ground: and then between these two false Leaves comes forth a Shoot, which produceth leaves like those of the Tree or Plant from whence it came. Of this way of growth, there be an infinite number both of Trees and Plants, as the Elm, Ash, Sycamore, Maple, Pear, Apple, Quince, and the most sorts of the seeds of Trees which are not environed by Stones or Shells: of seeds, the Melon, Parsnip, Carrot, Carduus, Angelica, and indeed most sorts of seeds.   CHAP. V. Of the several wayes to raise Forrest-trees, or others; and how to perform the same by Laying. THose sorts of Trees which will grow of Cuttings, are the easiest to raise by Layings, some of which sorts you may see in the next Chapter. Image 14 (page 10) Now touching the best time for laying your Layers of Trees� observe, that if they be Trees that hold their Leaf all Winter, as Firres, Pines, Holly, Yew, Box, Bayes, Lawrels, Elix, &c. Let such be laid about the latter end of August. But if they be such as shed their Leaf in Winter, as Oak, Elm, Line, Sycamore, Apple, Pear, Mulberry, &c. let such be laid about the middle of October. I do grant that you may lay at any time of the Year, but these times I take to be the best; for then they have the whole VVinter and Summer to prepare and draw Root in, at that time of the year the Sun having so much power on the sap of the Tree, as to feed the Leaf and Bud, but not to make a shoot: and if that little sap that rises, be hindred, as it is by some of the following wayes of laying, the Leaves and Buds yet gently craving of the Layer, makes the Layer prepare for Root, or put forth root a little to maintain it self, being it finds it cannot have it from the Mother-plant: and being it wants but little Nourishment at that time of the Year, I think it is better to lay Layers of Trees, and to set Cuttings, than at other times: In Summer when the sap is much abounding, or in VVinter when the sap stirres little, or in the Spring when the sap begins to rise; for then it comes too suddenly to draw sap from the Layer before it hath drawn or prepared for root: for Nature must be courted gently; though I know in small Plants, the Spring or Summer doth very well, for they being short-lived, are therefore the quicker in drawing root: and besides that, Trees are many times laid, as they are not. As for those Trees that are apt to grow of Cuttings, take but some of the boughs, and lay them into the Ground, covering them about half a foot with fresh fine Mould, leaving them with the end of your Layer about one foot, or a foot and a half out of the ground, keeping them moist in Summer; and in Twelve Months time you may remove them if rooted, if not, let them lie longer. Another way is, take a Bough you intend to lay, and cut it half way through right cross the wood, then slit it up towards the end, half a foot, or according as your Layer is in bigness, lay the slitted place into the ground, and you shall find that slitted place take root, if laid as the former, and so ordered. This way you may encrease many fine Flowers and small Plants, but they being out of my Element at this time, I shall not speak of the ordering them, for fear I seem tedious to some. Another way to lay a Layer of a Tree, is, take a piece of VVyer, and tie it hard round the bark of the place you intend to lay into the ground, twisting the ends of the VVier that it may not untie: prick the Page 11 place above the VVier thorough the bark with an Aul in several places, then lay it into the ground as the first. A fourth way of Laying of trees, is, Cut a place round, about one Inch or two, where you find it most convenient to lay into the ground, and so proceed as is shewed in the first way of Laying. A Fifth way to lay some sorts of Trees, is, to twist the place you intend to lay into the ground as you do a withe, and lay it as is shewed in the first way of Laying; by this way and the first, you may furnish your Woods and Hedges: For they being easie, any ordinary man will perform the same. Thus you may from one Stub, as a Sallow, or the like, between one Fall and another of your VVood, for a Rod square of Ground and more, (if that one Stub produce but strong shoots) fill it well with Wood: For when the Stub hath got two or three years shoot, then lay round it, as before at large is shewed, there letting them remain to produce new Stubs. But if you would increase by laying some young Trees from an high Standard, whence you cannot bend the boughs down to the ground, then you must prepare either Box, Basket, or Pot, and fill them full of fine sifted Mould, putting a little rotten VVillow-dust with this Earth, for that keeps Moysture to help the Layer to draw root; then set the Pot or Box thus fill'd with Earth, upon some Tressel or Post, as your Ingenuity will direct you, then lay your Bough by the second, third, or fourth way of Laying, leaving not too much head out, because the wind will offend it if you doe; and by its own motion be likely to rub off the tender young Root; and thus lay your Hops this way. These things observed, you may raise many choyse Trees, as Mulberry, Hors-Chesnut, &c. These Rules may instruct you sufficiently concerning the propagation of Trees by Laying; but let me tell you, it is hard to raise a fine straight Tree by a Layer, or Cutting: I have hinted at the Reasons before. Note, the smaller your Boughs be, Set them the less out of the ground, and keep them clean from VVeeds, that they spoyl not your Layers. Alsonote, that the harder the VVood is, then the young VVood will take root best, laid in the ground; but if a soft VVood, then older boughs will take Root best: Now you that be Lovers of wood, make use of these sure Directions, and if you repent, then blame me.   Image 15 (page 12) CHAP. VI. Of those sorts of Trees that will grow of Cuttings, and how to perform the same. IF your Ground be moist you may Set with success any sort of Willow, Sallow, or Osier, Alder, Water-Poplers, any sort of Apple that hath a black burry Knot breaking out of the Boughs; that Knot, if set a Foot deep in good Ground, and the top a Foot out, is apt to grow: Some sorts of Wildings, Codlings, Gennitings, some Sweetings, the smiling Willow, Quinces, Tamarisk, Lawrel, Firr, Box, &c. The time that I have spoke on for Laying your Layers, is also the very best time for Setting of Cuttings, which you may see in the fore-going Chapter, to be in August, for those sorts of Trees that hold their Leaves; and October for those Trees that cast their Leaves in Winter. Those sorts of Trees that do grow of Cuttings are common, therefore you may take your choice the better for the bigness of your Cuttings; which I Advise you to let be from half an Inch to one Inch Diameter: If they be less than half an Inch Diameter, then they will be weak, with a great Pith, which Pith will take wet, and be likely to Kill your Cutting: And besides, when your Cuttings be so small, they be not prepared with those pores, (as at present I name them) that is, little black specks on the Bark where the Root breaks out, I suppose, if Set in the Ground; or else Almighty God, for a Sign to shew Man that those that have that Mark upon them, will grow as your Elder, Alder, Sallow, Water-Poplers &c. hath; and also if they be Young, they then have not that burry Knot, which is very apt to take Root, as your Codlings, and some sorts of Apples have; in hard Wood, the Younger the better: But if they be greater than one Inch Diameter, then the top of your Cutting will be long in covering over, therefore may somewhat decay your Cutting by the wet lying on the Head so much. But you may Set your Willow and Water-Popler of a greater size, because they be Set for Pollard, where Cattle come, therefore they must be great and high, to be out of their harming the sooner; but the other size is most proper for your Hedges and VVoods. If you set them by a Crow of Iron, or by an Instrument which they have about Cambridge, that bores a hole in the Earth, somewhat like to an Auger; Let the Foot be free from cracks, cut smooth at bottom, and the Page 13 top of your Cutting the like, but let your top be slanted off; take care you do not rub up the Bark when you set your Cuttings; therefore make your holes large when you set them, and ram or tread the Earth close to them, keeping them moist the first Summer; and let the slant cut off the Head hang downward, and if your Cutting be choise, put a little soft VVax on the Head and Foot to keep out Air and VVet. VVhen you set any Tree or Trees in your VVoods or Hedges, be mindful to put in one or two Cuttings with them, it will not be much time lost to do it, but well spent, as I have often proved.   CHAP VII. Of such sorts of Trees as may be Raised by the Roots of another Tree; and how to Raise them. AS for such sorts of Trees which may be Raised onely from part of a Root of another Tree, there be many; but of those that I have made Experience, I shall in this place give an Account. First, Let the Tree be a thriving Tree, but not too Young, nor an Old Tree: For if it be too Young, then the Roots will be too small for this purpose; if too Old, 'tis possible the Roots may be a decaying, and then not fit for this purpose. Let the Roots be from a quarter of an Inch, to an Inch and a half Diameter, and from some Young thriving Tree is the best, for in them the Sap is plentiful, and therefore will put forth the greater shoot: then in the latter end of February, or the beginning of March, digg round the Trees you intend to increase from, till you find such Roots as before are mentioned, and taking your Knife, cut them three or four Inches from the great Root, smooth at the place you cut off; then Raise up that end, putting in the Earth to keep it up, that when your Ground is levelled again, the end of this Root so cut off, may be two or three Inches above Ground. I do Judge the fore-said time of the Year to be the best, for then the Sun hastning to the Vernal Equinoctial, or rather this Star of the Earth, to Libra, the Sun having heat, and a stronger drawing faculty on the Head of the Tree, draweth by its secret influence on the several Branches on the Head, and the Head from the Body, and both Head and Body from the Roots; and the Roots being furnished with Sap from the Earth, to supply the Body and the Head, is then the fitter to produce with that Sap a Image 16 (page 14) new Tree, likelier than when 'tis in its full Sap, viz. in Summer; for then the abundance of Sap will rather choak a Bud, than produce one out of the Root, if the Root be of such sort as will produce Trees from part of the Roots; and then the Weather is so hot, that it suffocates a new Bud that will be so full of Sap, as that will be, if any: and as to the opening of the Roots at that Season, how unnatural 'tis to the roots of the Mother-Tree, you may easily Judge. And then, to do this in Winter, though there is a continual Motion and Ascending of the Sap from the Roots (unless Accidentally hindred by Frosts) all the Year long (for Nature is no Sluggard) yet to cut the Roots then, and to expose them thus cut, as afore-said, to the extremity of the Weather, which then usually is great, the Frost and VVet pierce that new wound so much, that 'tis more likelier to Ruine, than to Increase its Kind; but if it doth Live, the Spring is the time when it will Bud; therefore by Consequence the best. My Reason for cutting the Root two or three Inches off from the great Root is (then) that two or three Inches of the Root will put forth many Roots at the end, especially if smooth cut off, and so the better for the Tree from whence you take the Roots. Thus much for the manner of Raising by part of Roots; the Kinds which may be thus Raised, are these that follow, viz. Elm, Maple, Poplar, Aspen, Abete, Cherry, Crab-tree, Plumb, VVhite bush, Serves, &c.   CHAP. VIII. What Soyl, or Dung is best for Trees, or their Seeds, &c. ANY sort of Dung that is very hot of it self, as Pigeons, Hens-dung, Sea-Coal, or VVood-Ashes, Soot, or Malt-dust, such or as heats after 'tis laid in the Ground; as Horse-dung, and Horse-Litter, or Green Grass, or VVeeds: these or the like, unless a small Quantity, and in very cold Ground, are better saved than used for Trees, especially Forest-trees; some Reasons may be given for this. First, their Fore-Fathers have not met with such Kindness, therefore their Children do not, nor cannot digest it so well. Secondly, these sorts of Dungs are good for several sorts of Plants, especially Annuals, for 'tis the Nature of them, where they meet with such warm Entertainment, to come up the sooner, provided the Dung be not so hot as to burn them; for Nature hath accustomed Page 15 them so much to a Yearly decay, that the Seeds of them will lay hold of the first Opportunity, and put forward for their Journey, either Spring, Summer, Autumn, or Winter; according as they meet with Provision for their Progress, till they have Accomplished that which was done for them, viz. produced Seeds. When your Forrest-Tree knoweth its continuance to be long, and that Naturally it hath many Years to produce its like, it will not be much forced by Art or Artificial means; for who can by the best Art or Care that can be used, force the Keys of an Ash to come up in a Year, or to grow but one Inch? For it will lie a Year or more before before it will begin to shoot; when as several sorts of Annuals will at any time of the Year come up in three or four days, if their Entertainment be accordingly. Therefore neither your Forrest-trees not their Seeds require much Dung, but love a ground Trenched deep with some Addition of fresh Earth, such as they delight in; as if your Ground be a strong Clay, then trench it deep, and mix it with fat Sand, Rubbish of Buildings, Sea-coal-ashes, Highway-Earth that hath drift Sand in it, or small Gravel-Lime, or Lime-Rubbish, &c. And if your Ground be a Gravel or Sand, then trench it and mix it with Loom-clay, the turf and upper part of each is very good, digging the Ground deep, and mixing it well: But if it be for an Orchard, you may add to any sort of Ground; some rotten dung of Horse or Cow, &c. will do very well, so it be not where your Root is; but set the Roots of any sort of Trees in fresh fine Mould. In stiff Ground it is good to trench it with Straw, Thatch, Litter, VVoodstack-Earth, or small wood, but let not your Roots stand upon these by no means, nor upon no dung or turf, but let them be at least one Inch or two from every Root; and then in a Year or two, when the Roots of your Tree comes to this Dung, or Soyl, the Ground will then have made it rotten and fit to lead your Root along in the Veins as it lieth for them, to find their Nourishment the better. Note, that those Trees whose Roots run shallow, do most delight in light Ground, as on a Gravel your Beech, Cherry, Ash; if mixed with Loom, the Elm or any; on a Brick Earth the Oak, Elm, Pear, &c. But for these I shall refer you to each particular Chapter of their Kinds. Of all sorts of Ground for Trees, or most sorts of Plants, I take your Clays to be the worst: that is, your strong blue, strong white, or strong red; but if any of these have some stones Naturally in them, they make them the better; and the nearer they turn to a mixture of Loom, they be so much the better: So likewise Gravelly or Sandy Ground, the nearer a Loom the better; for a Loom, that is, a light Brick-Earth, is the most Image 17 (page 16) Natural Ground for Gardens or Plantations that is. Your strong Grounds are worse for Trees than your light, especially for their Seeds; for they be more subject to great Weeds, as Couch-grass, Thistles, Nettles, &c. When your Gravelly Ground hath in most places a short Grass, or Mother of Thyme, or Moss, commonly the greatest Plant is Fern, which is very Natural to Seeds of Trees, and to the Roots of Trees: You may often see several Young Trees come up in Fern, which Naturally grows on your light Ground, therefore is most Natural for the increase of wood: But your strong Ground doth most commonly produce the greatest Oak, and your Gravelly or shallow Ground the finest Grain; that is, when Trees are on such Ground as they do Naturally Love to grow on, they then produce the greatest Grain, for then are their Annual Circles the greater; therefore such Trees are your strongest and toughest Timber. But when a Tree grows on a Ground it Naturally doth not like, then the Annual Circles being small, the Grain of such a Tree must by consequence be finer, and the Wood not so tough; so that these stately Trees do not love such great variety as your Annuals: For if they be in a Ground which they do not very well like, if you give them but room by deep and often digging, they will then search the further from home, and provide such Nourishment as will make them thrive, and be stately. When as your Annual Plants, and others that be not very long Lived, they will desire better, and more variety of Dung than your Forrest-trees. I have often admired what should be the Reason that some Plants will not come to their perfection, unless they stand on Dung, or that which will give a great heat; which would kill the Seeds of several others, did they but stand there one day: But as for the Reason of the heat that such Plants desire, it is because they were made for hot Countries, and therefore if we would have them to come to Maturity in our cold one, we must give them warm Lodging, especially in the Spring, which is too cold with us for them: but what is it then that Plant does feed on? But then to consider well this, why the heat of Grass or green Weeds should bring them forward as well as dung of Horses, provided you can keep it but as temperate (for 'tis subject to be too hot) and as long lasting, for it will not keep its heat long: where is then the salt, Sulphur and Mercury or Spirit in the Dung more than in the Grass to feed these Plants? Also I have Observed, that if you take Rich Mould, half or more of it rotten dung, and cover one end of your Bed with; the other end cover the same thickness with poor hungry Mould, provided you make it fine and fit for the Roots to run in, this last shall do as well, and many times better for any seeds on a hot bed, than the Rich Mould: Where is then Page 17 the salt Sulphur, or Mercury in the rich Mold, more than in the hungry, as most do hold, that the richer the mould, the more of them, and that all Plants draw their Nourishment from these matters; when I know that the seeds (most we sow on hot beds) could well digest that matter in the rich Mould, if it were there more than in the pore, and come on much forwarder in these Molds, each, if not on a hot-bed: the rich Mould would bring on Plants much stronger than the poor, provided the seeds be of such Plants that are quick of digestion. Pidgeons dung sown thin upon cold Land, and early in the Spring, is very good for Barley: But if sown late, and on dry hot ground, it will then do more harm than good, for it will burn up your seeds or plants: this dung is too hot and quick for the seeds of Trees; for 'tis the nature of Pidgeons to eat Salt, and to go to the sea-side early in the Mornings, and there to pick up Salt, which the heat of the Sun makes by drying up the salt water, and then leaving the salt upon the sand. Now this Fowl feeding so much upon salt, the dung of it is hotter and salter than any Fowl I know: Now the Reasons why it is good for cold Lands, and withall to sow it Early, are these: Every one knowes that 'tis the Nature of salt, that the dryer and hotter 'tis kept, the more it keeps its own Body, and doth not turn to water: And when it stands in a cold and moyst place, it then dissolves in a little time to water; and when 'tis turned into this Element of VVater, then is it fit for the nourishing and feeding of seeds, especially Annuals: For they be alwayes prepared to set forward in their Journey, provided they meet but with suitable Entertainment. But the seeds of most Forrest-trees, they will stay the time that their and our great God hath allotted them. But then why Salt should be a feeder of Plants or Seeds, I take the Reason to be this, namely, Salt-water; (yet I do not mean of Salt in a great quantity, and in meet places that will turn it into water.) I have oft observed, that Salt if fallen upon a Board or other place, it will be long a drying; and if Heat have made it drye, then Dews or Rain make it moyst again, then it steams forth, and that it is which nourisheth all Plants: VVhen if on a hot and dry ground, and late in the Spring, if dry weather come, then it doth not nor cannot yield its steam or fume, as Paracelsus in his Philosophy to the Athenians, lib. 3. p. 57. saith: Every Body or tangible substance is nothing but a curdled fume; whence (saith he) we may conclude, that there is a manifold Coagulation, one of VVood, another of Stones, a third of Mettals, but the Body is nothing but Fume, smoaking out of the Matter or Matrix in which it is. So that which groweth out of the Earth, is a fume, rising out of the Image 18 (page 18) Moysture of Mercury, which is various, and sendeth forth several fumes for Hearbs, Trees, &c. I do remember when I was a Boy, about fourteen years of Age, the Sea brake a bank into a Marsh of my Fathers, in Lincoln-shire, and did over-flow that Marsh and some others with salt Sea-water; the next Summer proving dry, all our Grass was clearly burnt up, so that I was very much concerned for some particular Reasons, thinking that all our Grass had been quite killed, and indeed so it appeared: The next Summer proved wet, so that towards the latter end we had some Grass again, and the third Summer we had Grass enough, but the fourth and many after in abundance. So that it appears, the ground was stupified with too much Kindness at first, but after the Rain had allayed the too much strength of the Salt water, then the Grass could well digest the gentle Fume: I would have those that lay Salt on their Gravel-walks to kill their weeds, observe if in a few years more they do not produce more weeds than some other that had not Salt laid on them at all. Sea-sand is a very good Compost for Ground, especially for stiffe Ground, for there it doth the too main parts to plants, or any seed or tree; that is, it makes way for the tree or seed to root in stiffe ground, and makes a Fume to feed it: but this is too nimble for the seeds of trees, (unless a very little) observe the Reasons before. Mault-dust is a most excellent Compost in a small quantity, for many sorts of Annual seeds, as I have oft tried with good success; but the Reasons are still the same: for this being a small part of the roots of the Barley, and being very dry, drinks in the Element of water, which is the principal and first matter of all things, (as a learned Author hath it, in the Genealogy of Minerals, p. 44) So wonderfully hath God created VVater, the first Matter of Nature, which though it be so tender and feeble a substance, yet from thence is created the most solid and durable Fruit: that is, from the fume of an Oyly, Earthy water, is the Life of all Plants. The parts of the dust being thus filled, upon the Suns attracting that and the Plant, the Root embraces this Fume: This little root, it having not life to grow, turns to Earth, and its Grave is a room to lead the root of another Plant in: it will give good entertainment to its own Kind. Thus you see, the Destruction of one is the increase of another: A little of this is good for some seed of Forrest-trees; but sow it not too thick, for any thing, lest it mold, or turn Musty. Note, that the place which is best for the root to be in, when the Tree or Plant is growing, is, the place that bringeth it soonest to Destruction Page 19 when dead, and contrary: for a Tree cannot live in water, or alwayes dry, and those preserve the Timber longest when the Tree is dead. This may be further improved by ingenuity. Note also, that the place which is best to keep the Fruit of a Tree in, is the very worst for a Tree or Plant to grow in, and contrary. Old Rags of Woollen Cloth, as is found by Experience by the industrious Farmer, cut into small pieces, are a good Compost for their Ground: they draw the Dew and Rain to them, and keep it till Sol's presence makes it fit for the Roots of the Plant: I judge them to be best for a pure dry soyl, because they hold their Moysture long, and I suppose 'tis a soyl that is lasting; for Wooll will not rot with wet suddenly. A little of this for the Trees or Seed on a dry Ground, will do good to them, as appears by the aforesaid Reasons: For Annuals better. Conny-clippings are of the same nature (but I do suppose they will not last so long) and are better for a stiffe ground. Saw-dust, if well rotten, and of soft woods, is very gratefull to the tender Roots or Seeds of any sort; 'tis good for dry ground, for it holds water, and makes way for the Roots of Trees very well, and is as good as most Preparers are. Rotten-dust out of hollow Trees, especially those of soft wood, is a rich Leader of tender young Roots: the Reason is shewed before. Soot is good to kill Moss, for its heat kills the Roots, for they lye on the top of the Earth: and good also to keep worms from doing harm to your Seeds. Sea-coal Ashes are very good in cold stiffe ground, either for Trees, or any other Plant, to make that ground work well, and to keep it hollow for the Roots to run in, &c. Rubbish of Buildings, that is, broken Bricks, and Stones and Lime is very good for the Roots of Trees in a stiffe cold Ground, the Reason is told you. Chalk broken small into pieces, is a very good Compost for stiffe cold grounds. There is much difference in Chalk, but that which is soft, fat Chalk, is good for such Ground as aforesaid, and for ground that is not very stiffe. Let your Reason instruct you further. Lime is a very rare Compost for cold Grounds, and stiffe Clayes, for its heat causeth a fume, and its tenderness makes way for the Roots, to fetch home their Nourishment, and its heat is great at first, therefore lay not on too much on no ground; and let that be slacked. If your dry ground be it your Tree delight to grow in, and you are forced Image 19 (page 20) to set them on wet, then adde some of this Lime among your Earth. Clay, especially that sort which is a light Brick-Earth, is very good for such Land that is a light shovey Gravel, or hath too much sand in it: Such grounds as these, they do not retain the spirit of Plants: for when Nature hath by the two Lovers, Star-Fire and VVater, generated their Babe, such ground as this doth drink down too fast, and again doth drye too hastily; so that the water cannot have time to leave nor to prepare its slime; which is the Mercury that makes that fume which feeds all Plants and their seeds: But this Clay must not be digged too deep, for then it wanteth of that which feedeth Plants, &c. I have taken the green Slime that is common in standing waters, (I do not mean the Frogs Spawn, which is cast many times into this) and have dryed it and beat it into fine dust, and then have mixed it with good fresh Earth, and have found very good success in raising several sorts of Flower-seeds and others: Though I have Notes of them, yet it is out of my Road to speak of them now, being I am Writing of the stately Forrest-trees. However, I may (its possible) write somewhat of them, if the Lord permits, and according as I find these few Lines Accepted of by some of the Royal Oaks of this our Age. For I do suppose that there is not one thing in Gardening yet well known: For (as a Learned Author hath it,) he that knows a thing well, must know what it was, is, and shall be; Therefore all humane Knowledge is but a shadow of superficial Learning reflecting upon mans Imagination, but not the least thing comprehended substantially. But to the business in hand, take Clay or Loom, and lay it on your Ground, not too thick, the beginning of Winter, and there let it be till the Frost hath made it fall into Mould, then in some dry open time harrow it all over: and if it be Ground you plow, then plow it in a drye time, but if it be Ground you trench for Forrest or Fruit-trees, observe to order it so: for by thus doing the Clay will mix with the Sand or Gravel much the better: The better that any man cheweth his Meat, it is certainly the easier to digest; and the dryer you put it into your ground (provided it hath but time to water it self well before your trees be set) 'tis the better; for then it draws the Mercury, and stores it up till the Roots have occasion for it: for 'tis quickly exhaled out of sand: but the Clay holds his store till a time of Necessity, and then contributes to the Roots, that is, in drye weather: and the smaller you make it to mix with your ground, the likelier the small Roots (as well as the great) are to meet with it. Note further, that the smaller your Plants be, the finer must your Earth be made, by skreening, fifting, beating, turning, &c. Page 21 I know by good success this to be true: for the Right Honourable my Lord (and the more to be honoured because a great Planter, and as great a Lover thereof) gave me order to make three Walks of Line-trees, from the New Garden to the New Bowling-green, and withall to make them descend towards the House, as neer as we could; which to doe, I was forced to cut through one Hill thirty Rod, most of the Hill two foot-deep, into a sharp Gravel, and the greatest part of all the length of the Walks was the same; they being Trees that I raised of Seeds, most of them, and the rest of Layers, at Hadham-Hail, they being with my Lord ever since their Minority, and he many times their Barber, engaged him to have the more particular Kindness for them, therefore he ordered me to doe what I thought good in preparing the ground for them: which I did as followeth. First I levelled the Hill, and when I had brought the Ground neer to the Level concluded on, I staked out my ground where every Tree should stand, and then ordered my holes to be made for my Trees, each hole three foot-deep, and four foot-wide, being the ground was so bad: This I did neer a Year before I set my Trees, and having the convenience of Brick-Earth near, I got near a Load to every hole, and mixed this with the Earth digged out of the Holes, turning it over twice, and in dry weather throwing out the greatest Stones, but the Turf I did throw into each Hole (the grass-side downward) as soon as they were made; but the Hill of Gravel I trenched that with Loom, Cow-dung, and the Litter under the Cow-racks, two Spade deep, and five foot on each side every row of Trees. Thus having prepared my ground, and the season of the year come, about the beginning of November, 1672. I had the Trees taken up with good help, as carefully as I could, and carried to Cashiobury, the place of their now Abode; and then having good store of help, and good Mould prepared, of the smallest and finest, I set the Trees with the upper part of the Roots of each Tree level with the top of the Ground, making a round hill half a foot high about every tree, and the Compass of the Hole. Having prun'd the heads of each Tree, and cut off the bruised Roots, and the Ends of such roots as were broken, I sorted the Trees, and observed this Method in placing them, namely; I set the highest next the Bowling-green, and so shorter and shorter till the lowest were next to the Garden; which I did for these Reasons: Next the Green was the worst Ground, and the Trees more in danger of being spoyled, by reason of a Market-path that goeth cross that end of the VValks to Watford. Image 20 (page 22) Thus having set my Trees streight in their Rows, and trod the Earth close to their Roots, and made my Hills, I then laid round every Tree, upon those Hills, wet Litter taken off from the Dung-hill, a good Barrow-full to every Tree, and covered that with a little Mould, leaving them to take their rest for a time; but early in the Spring I found them to begin their Progress, and that Summer they had such Heads shot forth, that I was forced to cut off some of their Heads (that is, the sideboughs) to keep the Wind from breaking them: There is in these four rows of Trees 296. and of these I lost not one Tree the first Year, but they did grow and shoot so well, that there were several Noble Men that saw them, did think, as they said, that they were not removed the Year before; but the year after we had three spoyled by some base Men or Boys. Of the very same parcel of Trees my Lord gave Sir William Temple thirty of the best of them, which he himself saw chosen out; they were Set at Sir William's House at Sheen, a much better Natur'd Ground than ours, yet they lost all but six of them the first Year: I saw a walk of Line-trees (but I think they were the Bastard-kind, which we have growing in many of our Woods in England) set at Debden-hall, the Right Worshipful Sir Richard Brown's House; the Natural ground was not bad for them, but how they were Ordered I do not know, for they had the first year not above one in ten that did grow any thing considerably. I saw the like (or worse) spoyl of the same Trees at my Lord Chief Baron Turnor's near Startford, where the ground might easily have been made very good for them. I onely write this, to perswade Noble Men, and others that are Lovers of Planting, to remember the old saying, viz. A thing once well done, is twice done: And those that are resolved to Plant, that they make their Ground fit for those Trees before they set them, and not bury them in a hole like a dead dog, as too too many do. Let me then beg that they may have good and fresh Lodgings sutable to their Quality, and good attendance also, to preserve them from their Enemies, till they be able to encounter with them; they that will not do this� let them never resolve to Plant Trees; for why should they spoil the least of those stately Monuments, and in so doing throw away their Monies? For let such note that Nature bestows not her gifts but where she finds sutable Convenience, therefore order your Ground well, and then you may see a good success, as my Lord hath had in several of his Plantations, though as bad ground as most is to Plant on. One Night (me thoughts) walking up one of Page 23 my Lords Line-walks, I heard the grateful Trees thus Paying the Tribute of their thanks to his Lordship: Like Pyramids our Stately Tops wee'l Raise, To Sing our Noble Benefactor's Praise; Freshly we will to After-ages show What Noble Essex did on us bestow; For we our very Being owe to him, Or else we had long since intombed been In Crop of Bird, or in Beasts Belly found, Or met our Death neglected on the ground: By him we cherish'd were with Dung and Spade, For which wee'l Recompence him with our Shade; And since his kindness saw us prun'd so well, We will Requite him with our Fragrant smell; In Winter (as in Gratitude is meet) Wee'l strew our humble Leaves beneath his Feet. Nay, in each Tree, Root, Trunck, Branch, all will be Proud to Serve him and his Posterity. Thus having shewed you by Example the good Effects of a light Brick-Earth upon Gravel, I could also tell the same of a Fat Sand, drift-sand, small Gravel upon your Clay or stiff Ground; but I hope that I have informed your Judgment so much, that you will Reasonably conclude with me, that the preparing of Ground for Trees is, onely to mix Ground so together, that there may be convenient room for the Roots to search for their Nourishment; and to humour the Tree so, that there may be a good part of the Natural Ground which each Tree delights to grow in. I know that if your Ground be a stiff Clay, then to trench and mix it with fat Sand, drift-sand, Lime, Rubbish, or Chalk and Lime, are great helps to such Ground, either for Trees, or Corn, or Grass; and more lasting than Dung, and for Forrest-Trees full as good as Dung: For it doth not onely give leave, and make way for the roots to run in the Earth, but takes away that over-moistness in the cold stiff Ground, which hinders Conception, by letting the water down into the Earth, and by keeping it from Cracking, and so Nourisheth the Spirit of the Earth, and also keeps it from spending it too hastily. Horse-dung is the best to make your hot beds with, for such Plants as are commonly raised of them be Annual Plants, but it is too hasty for the Seeds of Trees, unless it be rotten, and well mixed with Natural Mould: It is best for your stiff cold Lands, and if you lay it upon Image 21 (page 24) Plowed Ground (which 'tis best for) then Plow it in as soon as you can, for if it lies there to dry, there will a great part of the Oily substance, which makes the fume for nourishment of Plants, be exhaled out by the Sun: Let no sort of dung lie long on the top of your Ground unplowedin, but plow or dig it in as soon as you can; for by lying so, it doth not onely lose a great part of its goodness by the Sun (especially if it lies thin) but where your Dung-hill lies every shower will wash the strength of the dung into the Ground, so that if you take the dung off from that place as clean as you can, yet you shall have that place bear Ranker Corn than where you thought the dung had lain much thicker, if it lies long in a place. The Observation of this taught me many good Uses; as first, to lay dung about the Roots of Trees is much better than stones, as my Lord Bacon Advises in his Natural History; for this keeps moist the Ground better than they, and Rain washes the strength to the Roots, as is aforesaid: and if you dig in this when the strength is gone, and your Trees strong, it then prepares way for the Roots, and there is a great benefit to your Trees. Or if it is not digged-in, but lies on the top, and there turns to Earth, it then feeds the Roots on the top, and leads them upward. And seeing where Dung lies, the Ground is so much improved by the washing-in of the strength of the Dung, it may well inform you that Dung steeped in Water is very good, especially if you use Dung, in Quantity according to the Nature of your Plants, and strength of your Ground; the weaker your Ground, make your Water the stronger. There is in some places in Farmers Yards, a Water that washeth from their Dung-hills, a Load of which is not inferiour to a Load of Dung, yet by them totally Neglected; but of Waters I shall speak more in the next Chapter. Thus having hinted of these two Useful and Common Dungs, Cow and Horse, in the Example of these Line-trees; onely Observe this, and then I shall proceed: Horse-dung is best for Plants that are quick of Digestion and Growth, and for Trees or Plants that shoot much in a year; for it yields a great Fume, and such Plants can well dispose of it. Cow-dung is a good Soyl for most Trees or Plants of hot Ground, and better for durable Plants than it is for Annuals: It is Excellent for many sorts of rare Flowers, if first it be thorow-rotten, and then dryed and beaten to dust, and some fresh fine Earth then mixed well with it. Deers-dung is much of the Nature of Cows, or Bullocks; but 'tis more proper for tender and smaller Plants. Page 25 Sheeps-dung is also of the same Nature, but more agreeable to tender and small Seeds and Plants: By this our Yeomen and Farmers find good profit, by Folding their Sheep every Night on their own Lands; for there they find a far certain benefit on their Ground by the Dung and Urine which the Sheep make in one Night; though it is not long lasting, yet 'tis a sure help for the first Crop, and a good Addition to the second. This may teach you that a thin sprinkling of dung is more sure most years for your Corn-Land than greater Quantities; and also that to break your dung small is best; for the smaller the better, especially if you have laid it on your Ground not long before you sow, especially for your Summer-crops, from this I do Advise my Ingenuous Countrymen of these few Rules which are spoken before: To well Observe the Nature of your Land, and by so doing to enrich it with such Soyl and Dung as is most Natural to the Ground, and to the Seeds you intend to sow on it; and to lay it on your Ground at the most convenient times. First, as to the Ground, I have hinted at many useful Composts, and also that several of them are far more proper for some Grounds than they are for others, though there be many more sorts that may be and are made use of to very good Effect, yet I shall not trouble my self nor you with the naming any more, knowing that he that Understands to Number to 20 in Arithmetick, may soon count to a 100. Now, as to the Seed you intend to sow, whether it be of Trees, Plants, or any sort of Grain, the smaller your Seed is, make the ground the finer; the quicker your Seeds be of growth, and the more they run into stalks or leaves, your dung may then be the newer and stronger, and the more in Quantity, according to the Digestion of your Plants. But if for Trees or Plants of long lasting, then let the dung be the more rotten; and the more they be apt to shoot great shoots, the more you may allow them; but let them be sure of some such Ground as they Naturally delight to grow in, and also to allow them room that is large enough; for High and Lofty Spirits do not love to be Confined to little and small Cottages. And as for laying it on your Ground, if the time be the Spring, that is most proper to sow your Seed, then lay such dung as is hot and dry early on your Ground; and rather erre in too little than too much, such dungs as be your Pigeons, Hens, Sea-coal-ashes, &c. But if they be hot and moist, such as Horse-dung, Horse-litter, or Green grass, Hay, &c. these be most proper for Annuals, and it is not good to be too sparing toward these tender Plants; rather erre in keeping your Image 22 (page 26) dung too dry than too wet, for in so doing you shall keep its heat the longer, and have the more Command to keep it so: But if you have occasion to lay dung on Ground to help such Trees or Plants as are not Annual, but more slow in their progress, then mix such dung thin, and not too near the Roots; but if it be the Autumn Season that you have occasion to lay it on your Land, then lay it something thicker; for the Winter will qualifie the strength and heat of it. To conclude, if you are to lay dung on Land that you are to sow with Seed that doth not run much into stalks, and is but slow in growing, then do as our Farmers do, let it be rotten and mixed well with Mould before you lay it on your Land, and then your Grain or Seed will the better agree with it, or else you may find on your Land strong great Weeds, such as the Ground is most inclined to; for strong Land will produce the stronger Weeds, and the other contrary. Therefore if your Dung be too rank and new for the Seed you intend to Sow your Ground with, then mix it with some other Compost as is most proper for your Land, and most convenient to be had: and if your Land be stiff, then mix it with Chalk, Light Sandy Ground, or somewhat of the like Nature; laying a good quantity of Earth first, then your Dung, and then Earth to cover your Dung all over; by so doing you will save that Oyly water which will soak from the Dung by showers of Rain into the Earth under the dung: and by covering your dung with Earth it will keep the Sun from drying out that moisture; and whatever Fumes arise, the Earth on the top will receive: be sure you let it not grow with Weeds on the top, but when you find them to appear, take them off, and suffer none to grow on your Compost; or turn it over, and mix it with your Earth below, however let it be mixed together before you lay it on your Land: Thus do with New Horse-dung and Litter, but if it be any other dung, lay it on your Land as soon as Opportunity serveth; for the longer you let it lie, the more it loseth of its strength, therefore lay it on rather too thin, and in dry weather, and early. To assist Nature do thou not neglect; �se her not Roughly, lest there be defect. Thus much may serve for Trees, but if it be for Flowers, or other fine and tender Plants, you then must be more Curious, and mix your Earth better; but they be out of my Road at this time. The main business is to prepare your Ground so, that there may be room for the roots to run in, to fetch their Nourishment. As for Trees and Plants Page 27 that root deep, trench your Ground accordingly, &c. Now, for to please the Tree or Plant with such Earth as it delights to be in, add such a quantity of dung as may be sutable to the growth of your Tree or Plant, thereby to make a fume to feed it; for let this fume be made of what it will, for-my part, I shall not contend whether it be Salt, Sulphur, or Mercury; or as some affirm, that 'tis Salt, Sulphur, Mercury, and Spirit: All, or any one of these that feeds the Plants of this Terrestrial Globe; or if it be Fire, Earth, Water, or Air, as was formerly the Opinion of the Learned; for Sulphur or Brimstone may answer to Fire, Salt to the Earth, Mercury to Water, Spirit to Air. For 'tis certain, that Plants have Salt, Sulphur, Mercury, and Spirit in them; some more than others, according to their Heat or Coldness, but that they feed on these is not certain to me: But it is as I conceive the Fume, Steam, or more properly the Spirit of the Earth that they feed on; for the Earth is full of Spirit, which is the cause of the vast many productions of Plants, and Insects which are produced every year, and from no seed or sperm, but according to the fit Matrix of the Earth; and the Star-fire, and Virgin Mercury: their Dame Nature is then busie to make some Plant or Insect according as she hath provided a Breast to suckle and feed them. The Earth is then but onely a Lodging-place, and simple Water is onely its Garment; for simple crude Water feeds nothing, but is rather Destructive, as is seen by Water that runs forth on a Gravel, and the stream quick, there is feldome good Meadows by such Rivers, unless there be some Town that washeth it self into the River, or good Rich Land, or Lanes, or the like. Your Spring-water, unless it have some assistance, is the like; but of Water, see more in the next Chapter. And now I shall give you an Example of Earth, by which you may well perceive that Plants do not feed on simple Earth, nor crude Water. My Lord was the Author that told me this, and as soon as the Season of the year did permit me, I then did try the Experiment, which was thus performed. I took out of a Hill of good Rich fresh Earth (which I had prepared for other things) some of the dryest, somewhat above a good large Flower-pot full; this I carried into a little Room, which I had at Hadham-Hall, it joyned upon the Bake-house; there I spread this Earth thin upon the shelves, now and then turning it till it was as dry as dust, and as I thought, as dry as it well could be, provided it were not burned: having thus prepared my Earth, I filled a Flowerpot with it, which pot and Earth thus filled, weighed as exactly as I could weigh it just eighteen pounds and a half. Image 23 (page 28) March approaching, in the year 1666, I put this pot into a hot bed, to secure the seeds, and withall to help forward my design to preserve them: the seeds were Purslain which I sowed in it, the quantity was very small: I kept this pot in hot Beds till the beginning of May, and then I set it under a South Wall, where it stood till that Moneth was out, and then I set it in the shade from the Meridian Sun: there it stood till the latter end of August, and then finding my Plants full of seed and at a stand, I then cut up the Purslain close to the ground, at Noon-time, when it was very dry, and weighed the Purslain as exactly as I could, and it weighed just six pound two ounces. Then I took the pot of Earth and set it in a South Window in a Banqueting House to dry, turning the Earth to the Sun, to dry out some of the moisture, for the Earth was wet, for I had kept this pot with watering all the Summer, as occasion served: then I took this pot of Earth, and carried it into the little Room to dry the Earth as I did before, and putting some of the Earth into a Box, and the rest in the pot, I made it as dry as it well could be, or at least as dry as it was when I sowed my seeds in it: and then putting all my Earth into the pot again, I weighed it as exactly as I had done before, and then the pot and the Earth weighted just eighteen pound and seven ounces; there was, I confess, the roots of the Purslain, but when they were dryed, I do believe they did not weigh one ounce; and this one ounce that it lost of weight might be Earth dashed over with Rains. Now, these Plants weighing so much, and the Earth wasted or decreased in its weight so little, doth plainly shew that Plants do not feed onely on Earth; for I do believe this, that the earth that was wasted, was dashed out of the pot by hasty watering, and by sudden showers of Rain, or perchance some might go out of the holes of the pot with the Water. Now, though Plants do not feed on earth, yet Earth is the Nurse and receptacle of most things, and the Earth is spongy and porous, fit to receive the several Influences of the Heavens, of Heat, Rains, and Dews; and stores them up for the Conservation of her products: and when the seed or plant desire it, is put into Motion by the Coelestial heat the earth freely gives out of her store, according as the Plant can dispose of it. And if there be no Plants to feed on this Spirit of the Earth, then many times Nature makes some which do; for the earth will produce several Plants of its self, without seed or root, but they be Plants of no long lasting, and when they die, they then turn to Air and Spirit, as all things do; for there is nothing that is at a certain stay, for all things Page 29 have their time of increasing, and their time of decaying, till they be turned to that of which they were made. No man can see Trees grow, yet all men know that they doe: It is plain to see when a Trees is decaying, yet to know how long it will be before it is of its own decaying turned to Earth or Dust, is hard to know: Though it is Reported, that an Oak is a hundred years a growing, a hundred years stands at a stay, and a hundred years decaying, yet this is very erroneous; for on shallow Grounds an Oak will not grow so long, and on deep ground much longer, and neither it nor any thing else stands at a stay, but when it doth begin to decay, it keeps on, according as it meets with Accidents, till it comes to dust. Thus have I ghess'd, but whether right or no, The Criticks lash I'm sure to undergoe. I to th'ingen'ous Practiser direct These lines, which hope with him to gain Respect; For Learned men oft-times mistaken are, When Fools as oft ghesse right, though unaware.   CHAP. IX. Of Water for Trees and Seeds, and watering them. I Have oft observed your Cisterns and other places, that are onely filled with Rain-water, that that water will in a Summers time produce several sorts of Insects, and some sort of Water-plants; and also that it will leave a green slime not much unlike to Plants, which substance (or slime as I tearm it) would certainly be spent into Plants, were there but some quantity of Aquatick Plants put into this water; such as Mints of any sort, yellow Water-flagge, Flower-de-luce, Crabsclaws, or water Sen-green, Brook-lime, Ducks-meat, &c. I once made an Experiment to trye this, which I have here inserted, and thus it was: I took two water-pots, and filled them full of water, out of a Fountain which had been filled by Snow and Rain the Winter before, and which was made clean the Michaelmas before: I set these two pots, thus filled, in the open Air, but in the shade, and put into one of them a good handfull of Mints, the Runners, which I put Image 24 (page 30) in the first of March, 1664. where I let them continue till the first of April next, and then put in a fresh handfull, and let that continue for one Moneth more, and so I did both May and June: I poured out this Water about the beginning of September, to observe which of those Pots had the most of this slime: whereupon I found, that pot that had no Mints put into it, had twice as much, and being forced too to fill up that pot that had the Mints with the same water often, and that pot that had no Herbs in it, the slime of it was green; the other pots settlement that was in it, was black, and of an Earthy colour: I did intend to have prosecuted this further, as to have filled two pots of fresh Earth, and not too rich, and to have sown in them several Seeds, and to have kept them from all water but this, and then to have noted well the success, with more like Fancies which I thought on; but I was prohibited by one of the Drones of this Age, and did not know whether I should stay or not. A Stone lying in water gets a kind of slime about it; and if you put into water seeds that be quick of growth, (as most of your Annuals are) keep it but temperately hot, and they will in a little time spear out, and then if you put them into fine Mould, temperately moyst and warm, you may (if you pull up one of them and observe) see the Roots feeding upon a white substance, which I have often observed; for in water is the seed of all things. Likewise put seed into Earth, and if it be very dry, then though it be kept never so temperately hot, it will rather keep the seeds from growing than hasten them. But water dissolves, then Life followeth the dissolution; for water opens the parts of the Seed, and makes them swell, then they draw the Spirit of the water to them, (for the World is full of Spirit) so the Seeds they have been so long in water till the body of them cracks, which is as soon as it hath filled it self with enough to make a Root, then that seed if once dryed, and a stop put to its proceedings, the Art of Man cannot make it grow again. I have heard some affirm, that Malt will grow, but 'tis false, unless they mean some Barley-corns which never speared. Therefore if you have once watered Seed, keep them with watering if the Earth require; and if your Earth be poor, and your seeds great growers, then water with rich dunged water, and often, but let it not touch the Leaves; and if you think your ground be too Rich for the Nature of your seed, then water your seed with water not very Rich; but if your seeds be slow growers, for such keep your ground only moyst, and no more; for, though it be Earth that stores up the Spirit that seeds Plants, yet it is water that sets it on motion, and water Page 31 is full of Spirit also, but without Heat both these lie still: for Heat draws out first the crude water, and sends it into the Aire: Therefore, unless it be for Aquatick Plants, or Plants that grow much, and the weather be warm and drying, do not water too much, keep your Earth just moyst; for when ground is full of water, the Coelestial Fire heats first the superficies of the Earth, and puts that into a fume, but the Roots which are deeper in the ground being covered with water, there is no fume riseth there till most of the water be drawn up by the Sun, or settled into the Earth: Therefore if your Ground be subject to be wet, keep it loose and open, by deep trenching, and Earth to drein away water; for it is oft seen, that good Land that lies low in a wet Spring hath no great burden, because it is over pressed with wet; and dunged Land in a wet year bears the worst Corn, especially if it be low stiffe Land; for Dung then holdeth the Moysture, and the ground being wet withall, commonly doth produce great weeds, which can digest the spirit of the Earth and Water better than Corn, because they grow much quicker, and so they spoyl the Corn: For the greatest good that Dung doth to Land, is, to hold the water in the ground, and to keep the ground hollow, for the Roots to fetch their Nourishment. For 'tis the nature of Dung to draw water to it, to fill it self like a Sponge; and when dry weather comes, then it spends it self in fume, and so it wastes it self, and feeds Plants by its decay. Thus you may see and admire the Order of the great God of Nature, that the Destruction of one should be the Preservation of another. This you may observe in rotten Wood, Malt-dust, Wool, woollen Rags, Horn-shavings, &c. how full they will be with every little Dew, and keep that longer than a Clod of Earth twice as big, thus will they doe till they be turn'd to a very little Earth: By this you may inform your self what sort of Dung will last longest. Some sorts of Dung there be, that if they be not over-pressed with Water, will waste themselves by their own heat; Witness your Hot-beds, &c. yet notwithstanding, this heat is very Natural to Annual Plants. Dung steeped in Water, or water strained thorow Dung, doth take a great part of the substance and strength of the Dung with it, and that water when dryed up in the ground, and evaporated, when Rain or Dew falls on that place, it there leaveth such an Oily or slimy substance as catcheth the Water or Dew, and hindereth it from running deep into the Earth, and then the Over-plus which the Plants receive not, is rarified into Air, till it hath spent it self as it were to nothing. Image 25 (page 32) After dry weather in Summer, if there comes a good shower, and a warm day after, you may see this Fume hang in the Aire, sometimes low, close to the ground, as if it were loth to part with the Earth, and toward the latter end of Summer, if great Rain and warm VVeather happen, then this Fume being great, and the Nights something cold, it will spend it self in Mushromes, Puffes, &c. as old Trees and rotten VVood will doe, where there is a great decay, and nothing to feed on. Therefore, if you fear dry VVeather, do not deferre too long before you water your Trees and Seeds, but water while your ground is yet moyst: for believe me, I would not have you stay too long before you water, if you be minded to water at all: And also when you do water, do it well; Consider the depth of your Roots, and those that root deepest, water most; and also when you begin to water, continue it as long as you find occasion: water Trees well, and Seeds and small Plants often: use not VVell-water, especially for tender Plants, for it is so strained thorow the Earth that it hath little spirit to mak Nourishment in it for Plants. Rivers that run quick and long on sharp gravel are little better; therefore if you must use such, let them stand some time in the Sun, in Tubs, &c. mixed with Dung. Let the Quantity and Quality of your Dung be according to the Nature of your Plants; as, if your Plants be great growers, and require heat, then put Horse-dung� &c. in the water. If your Plants be fine and tender, then put Sheeps Dung, or Cows-dung, &c. into the water, remembring, that if you think your ground be bad, you must adde the more Dung. If your VVater be bad (as is aforesaid) and that you put Dung into it to help it, let it then stand in the Sun and open Aire uncovered. Take care you water no Plants with standing stinking Ditch water, nor no water that stinketh: for sweet water not too clear, and fresh Mould, not musty or tainted by stinking weeds, &c. is as proper for tender Plants, as sweet and good Food, and warm and clean Lodging is to a tender fine-bred man. Rain-water I take to be very good, if not too long kept; yet if your Vessel be large, the oftner you stirre it, the longer it will keep sweet. Large and Navigable Rivers, (such as our Thames) that receive much Soyl by the washing of Streets, and the many Sinks that run into it, and which by its own motion doth cleanse it self from that which is noxious both to Man and Plants; is a most excellent Water for all sorts of Plants. Page 33 The larger that Ponds be, the better their water is for Plants; and if they have the shoot of some Stable-yard into them, it addes much to their goodness; the opener they be to the Sun, the better; and the more of motion they have, as by Horses washing in them, or Geese or Ducks swimming in them, 'tis so much the better: for the swimming of Ducks in Summer in your small Ponds will keep the Water from smelling. Now having shewed you several wayes of raising Forrest-trees, with some other hints of their Seed, &c. and of Compost for them, and of VVater, and VVatering them, I now shall shew you the manner how to raise them of Seed, which is to be preferred before all others, though some of the aforesaid wayes for some Trees are much easier and quicker. Good Aire for Plants (as well as Men) is much assisting to their Health and Life, for without this nothing can live; and that which is most healthfull for tender Men, is also the best for tender Plants. Aire takes up the earthy Exhalations of all sorts, and there mingles them together, and being touched with Coelestial Fire, it reduceth them into general Principles, for great uses. I shall say no more of Aire, for it is an Hermaphrodite, and is inclosed in Water, therefore near a-kin to it.   Image 26 (page 34) CHAP. X. Of the Oaks Raising and Improving. I Shall not trouble you with the several kinds there be; though the Learned J. Evelyn, Esq; Reduceth them to four, in his Discourse of Forest-Trees, but if they were distinguished by several Names, as we do our Pears, you might find as many varieties, onely according to the shape and taste of the Acorn: for as we know by Experience that several of our Pear-Trees grow Pyramid-like, as the Oakman-berry, and Bordon-Musk-Pears, &c. And some likewise grow much spreading, as the Winter-Bonchristian, the back Pear of Worcester, &c. Even so do some of your Oaks; therefore if you desire aspiring Trees, take care to gather your Acorns off from such Trees, or rather gather them from under some such Trees, when fallen, and in a dry time if you can. When you have so done, lay your Acorns thin in some open Room to dry, and when they be dry, keep them in some dry place till the latter end of January, and having prepared some good fresh Loomy Ground, by digging and keeping it clean before-hand, sow them, and let them be covered about an Inch and a half, or two Inches deep; by sowing them at this time, you shall save a great many, which otherwise would have been spoyled by Mice or other Vermin; but if it happen to be a wet time when they fall, then will they begin to spear out in a short time after: And then so soon as you see them shoot forth a little bud at the small ends, commit them to their Spouse as soon as may be; for when they be come to the time that the Almighty hath alotted them, and be sed and made lusty by the dews and showers of the Heavens, then the Star-fire impregnats the Moysture in the seed, and then the seed throws off, or endeavours to do it, and then takes his Lodging in the Earth, where he prepares a room for his Off-spring; that is, as soon as the seed hath imbibed himself in the Water, and received heat, (for without both these no seeds can produce its kinds) the Body of the Acorn cracks, and the spear shoots into the Earth, and as soon as it hath got Entertainment there, and the Season of the year agreeable, the Body of the seed either turns into leaves, or spends it self into leaves, and that little small part of the seed, the spear, that shoots forth Root, and Page 35 then shot and leaves; so that if the Acorn hath had a convenient quantity of heat and moisture (but if too much of either of these, that is deadly to all seeds) then the seed spears forth, and if it be not committed to the Ground before it be dryed, and the spear withered, then for certain that Seed, Acorn, Nut, or Stone will never grow. For Nature, if once set on Motion, will rather cease to be, than alter its course; for Nature hates violence, neither can the seed receive this precious sperm without these two, Father and Mother; and these two must have a sutable Agreement between them: for though one Vessel be sufficient to perfect the Infant in the Womb, yet Nature hath not been wanting to provide several Breasts to Nourish it. Therefore if your Acorns have taken wet, and the heat hath made them spear, you must sow them as soon as you can, and venture them a whole Winter in the Ground; remembring to keep some Traps set to catch the Mice. In the Spring following they will come up, keep them clean from Weeds, and let them stand two or three years on their first bed, then having prepared a piece of good fresh Ground, by adding some rotten dung to it, if poor; or good fresh Rich Ground (which is better than dung) cut the tap-root, and the side-boughs, and set them as you do other Trees in your Nurseries, keep your Ground with digging, and the Trees with pruning up every year; thus Order them till you find them fit to Remove, and you will then find no such hazard in the Removing them, as if they were never Transplanted before; for there is a great deal of Reason to be given that the oftner you Remove a Tree, the likelier 'tis to grow when it is Removed again, provided it be not too great. Besides, Experience doth plainly shew the same, for I have often found that a Walnut-Tree set of a Nut, and never-removed in its Minority, but still keeping his place of Situation, till it is six or seven Foot high, that in Removing such a Tree, you shall find near as much hazard in the growing of that Tree, as in Removing an Oak of the same stature, provided the Oak hath had his Abode in open Air, and not been tenderly Nursed up in a Wood; for such Trees, let them be of what kind you will, are nice to be removed out of their warm Habitation: But at this I have hinted before. Now, to shew you some Reason why any Tree being Removed before, is the likelier to grow when removed again, Observe these few Rules: First, 'Tis the Nature of all Trees to put forth one Root first, and then some side-roots, according to the Kind and Nature of the Ground; and this most stately Tree doth commonly run to the bottom of the Soyl that is fit for his Nourishment, before it puts forth many side-roots, especially in a loose, hollow Ground, and then at the end of the tap-root Image 27 (page 36) it puts forth feeding Roots, and when this Tree comes to be pretty big, it having few feeding Roots near home, the Tree can hardly be taken up well, without losing most of them, which will be a great hazard to the loss of your Tree. Secondly, But when a Tree is taken up young, as at one, two, or three years old, then there is but small head, so that a little Root will maintain that, and then this little Root lying not deep, and in a little compass of Ground, may be taken up with less loss, to the proportion of the Head, than a greater. Thirdly, When you have taken up these young Trees, in cutting off the end of the tap-root, and the ends of the greatest of the others, those very ends so cut off with the slope lowermost, will at that place put forth many small Roots, which lying near to the Body of the Tree, are the easier to be taken up with the Tree when 'tis Removed again. Lastly, Custom in Removing of Trees tends somewhat to their growing, being Removed; for I sansie, that if you could get some Acorns of an Oak, that had (with his Fore-Fathers) been accustomed to Removing, as our Apple-stocks are, I do Judge it would be then as patient of changing his Habitation as they. From that which hath been said I hope you will conclude with me, that 'tis best to Remove, either Forest-Trees, or others, when young; for if you Remove them when they be older, the better the Ground is, the more the Tree runs down with a tap-root; therefore if never Removed before, the worse to remove off from such a Ground. Thus having Ordered these Young Trees till you have Nursed them up to the stature of six or seven Foot high, you may afterwards Transplant them into your Walks, Wood, or where else your Fancy pleaseth, onely in Transplanting Observe this: Make your holes four Foot wide, and two Spade deep at least; half a year, or a quarter at least before the time of Planting (if it be a year 'tis the better, provided you keep that Mould which you threw out of the holes clean from Weeds and Grass, by turning it over as Occasion requires) and if you think your Ground be poor, or of some contrary Soyl to what your Tree Naturally delights to grow in, mix it with some such like Earth as your Tree doth best delight to grow in; as for an Oak, if your Ground be Gravelly, mix it then with the upper Spade of Ground that is a Brick-Earth, turning these together with the Earth you did throw out of the holes; if Clay, mix it then with a light Loom, or a fat Sand, or small Gravel; and if the Ground be poor, a little laying of rotten dung in the bottom of your holes, but let none be Page 37 among your Earth when you set your Trees, that is, to touch the roots of them. Having thus prepared your holes for your Tree, and your Earth, if your Ground be a dry Soyl, then begin as soon as you find the Leaf to fall, that is in October: 'Tis not the Hill or Valley, North or South Situation which makes the finer or tougher Grain; but if there be a seeding Ground on the top of an Hill, or on the North side, more than there is in the Valley or South-side, there then will be the toughest Timber; for where a Tree grows most in a year, that Oak is the toughest Timber, and there that Tree shall have the most sap, as on a deep Loomy Ground: But let it be Hill or Valley, if it be a shallow ground, and the bottom Gravel, and not mixed with Loom or Clay, there Oaks will grow slow, and the Annual Circles being close together, the Timber must then be the finer Grained: and the sap of such Oaks is little, as I have many times Observed: Experience and Reason (which I have alwayes hitherto taken with me as Guides in my Travel and Search after Nature) have confirmed me in this: A light Brick-Earth, or a Loomy-Clay produce the stateliest Oaks, soonest, and toughest Timber, for there they grow quickest, Your Clays produce great Oaks, for that is a holding Ground; although they grow sometimes slow, yet they last long. Your Gravel produceth many Oaks, and streight, they grow slow, the Timber is fine, and they decay while they be young; the Reasons of this I have told you before. Having made Ready your Holes, and taken up your Trees well, I Advise you to open the Earth well round your Tree, keeping the side of your Spade to the Body of your Tree, to prevent Cutting the Roots when you take them up; and also to digg deep round the Tree, that when you come to pull up your Tree, it may come up easily, which will prevent those Roots which grow Elbow-like, which if they do not break off in pulling up, by straining them to pull up, they will crack so in the Elbow, that they will never grow, nor put forth Roots below that place; therefore for such Trees as be ticklish to Remove, take the more time, lest you verifie the Old Proverb, which saith, Too much haste Oft makes waste. Such Roots as you find Bruised, or much Cracked, cut them off, till you come at firm sound Root. Such Trees as are slow-growers, as the Oak is, you may prune up to the smaller Head; as, if your Image 28 (page 38) Tree be taper and streight, you may prune up such a Tree to one shoot; but if your Tree be not taper, then leave two side-boughs, or more, to receive some of the Sap, which will make the shoot that you intend shall lead to make the body of the Tree, the smaller, and so your Tree will be taper; but top your shoots, all but your leading-shoot, which will make the Body of your Tree swell the more, and hinder them from equalling the leading-shoot, and by topping the other it will grow the stronger: I need not tell you which shoot you should leave to be the leading-shoot for your Tree, not Questioning but Sence and Reason will teach you to leave that which grows streightest and strongest; if you do leave any shoots, as most often it is necessary, leave them not right against one another, for that will make the Tree grow too suddenly thick in that place, but leave them one above another, so will your Tree grow the more taper, for it will be less and less upward, between the shoots, which shoots you must take off Year after Year, as your Tree runs up in height, minding still, now and then to leave some side-boughs to keep the Tree taper, or else you will want your height of Timber; or your Tree may grow top heavy, and so Crooked: I speak of Timber-trees, or the ways to Order Trees for Timber, (for I wish all Oaks were fit for Timber) but if your leading-shoot be much Crooked, then top it underneath a bud that tends upward, so low as if that bud lead away, it may grow near streight up; or cut off the leading-shoot under another that grows more upright, Ordering it to be the leading-shoot so, as your Tree grows, mind to lead it up every Year, according as you see Cause, taking care to keep off the Suckers, especially the first Year, unless you find the Head grow too great for the Body, then leave some side-boughs to receive some Sap, and to make your Tree taper, but this you shall hardly find in Oaks in their first Years growth, namely, to grow too much in Head. Thus endeavouring to keep your Tree, (of what sort soever it be, if it be for Timber) with no great Head, still keep the leading-shoot uppermost, by sometimes heading the other side-boughs, about a Foot or more from the Body, or else they will be ready sometimes to make your Tree top-heavy, therefore keep your Tree till you have got it to the height you intend, by keeping it as is above-said; and if you find it is not taper by these means, then in the Moneth February slit the Bark quite thorow on three or four sides, according to the bigness of your Tree; but if small, but one or two: so if the Tree be three yards high to the Head, then let three slits go up one yard, two slits two yards high, and one to the top: But if it be a streight Tree, and taper, as you Page 39 would have it, if the Bark be bound, slit it on one or two sides, from the Ground to the top. If your tree be young, though thriving, it will do it no harm, but much good, for you may see in many thriving trees the Bark part of it self, telling you that it wants your help, therefore observe Nature, and assist her in all your undertakings; for Wisdom standeth, not onely in the Streets, but in the Woods, calling to you to learn of her. Note also, if you find any tree Crooked, slit it in the ham at the afore-said time, and take off some of the lower side of his Head, and you will help the crook of the tree, whether it be great or small; and in time, by so doing, it will grow streight: for by slitting the Bark in the ham it makes the tree swell there, and so sets the tree streight; therefore make two or three slits in the ham, according to the bigness of the tree and crook; but if the tree be pretty great, then take your Bill and cut the Bark thorow in the ham in several places, about two or three Inches asunder, let the Cut be cut slanting upward, a little cross the Diameter of the tree; by so doing you will stop the Sap in that place, the Bark will dilate, and the place grow greater, and so the tree will grow streighter. Sometimes if your tree be not taper, in Summer when it shoots much, the weight of the Head will draw the Body crooked, and the Head will incline to the Ground; in such trees Leave shoots on the Body, to check and receive the Sap, and to keep it from abounding too much in the Head; but when you find your tree grown crooked by the Head, in Summer, with Leaves and Boughs weighing it down, as soon as you find it begin to leane, take off some of the Boughs on the leaning side, and top some according as you see cause: By this Summer-pruning you may keep your tree streight, therefore Observe it. I have found good success on Walnut-trees and Lines by it, &c. But though Oaks grow Crooked, it is not often by their great shoots, for on most Grounds it grows slowly, but sometimes their Head, or leading shoot being cropped off by Cattel, it then breaks out on the sides into several leading shoots, and one leads one way, and another another; and so distributeth the Sap, which makes the tree not onely grow crooked, but slowly; and sometimes the early shooting of the leading-shoot in the Spring causeth the same: For Frost coming upon the tender leaves and leading-bud, kills them, and then it is forc'd to break out a new on the sides; this happens often-times to young seedling Oaks in long Grass, which would gladly be more in the open Air, but by making too much haste many times they lose their Heads for it. Now in such Cases you must take off some, and cut some half a Foot off from the leading-shoot, Image 29 (page 40) preserving that which is most likelie for the leading shoot, which though it be crooked, despair not, for Naturally it will grow streighter, and if you use pruning, and the afore-said Rules, it will be streight much the sooner. But in case you find your Young Oak very much stubbed near the Ground, and never a shoot that is fit to lead to make a Tree, in such a young Tree you must cut it off close at the Ground, in the Spring-time, so shall you have one fine shoot or more, but be sure take off all but one, and then you shall find that shoot thrive very much, till it hath got such a Head in bigness as the Head was before, and the Bark being then fine, it will enlarge it self for the growth of the shoot, and give good way for the Sap to run into the Head, and so make a fine Tree; therefore if your Tree be stunned, or much Crooked, then take this course, to head them close at the ground, and the Summer following neglect not to take off all the shoots but one, for at Midsomer it is as good, nay, better to prune some Trees than in the Spring, for then the Sap will soon cover round that wounded place, and if not heal it quite, it will preserve it from much harm, till the Spring following, and at that time shoots will not break out much into the head, to make it top-heavy: You may safely cut off small branches, and prune small Trees at this Summer-season. And for such Trees as have a great Pith, as the Ash and Walnut, I take it to be the best time for them. And whereas some say to the contrary, yet if the Reader will be Advised by me, let him prune such in Summer. But in the midst of Winter forbear to prune most Trees, especially great Boughs, or such Trees as have a great Pith, or tender, for then the wound lyeth exposed to the open Air and Wet, and Frost coming upon the Wet, and piercing so far into the wounded place as the wet hath gone, kills the Wood, and makes a hole in that place, and that hole holding Water many times, Kills many a good Tree, especially where great Boughs are taken off, for they be long a covering over; and never will be covered if the Tree be Old. Therefore if your Tree be Old, forbear to cut off great Boughs; but if for some Reasons you are forced to do it, then cut off such Boughs two Foot, or a Yard from the Body of your Timber-tree; and let the place where you cut off such a Limb be perpendicular to the Horizon, rather inclining to the Nadir, than the Zenith; by so doing, the water will not lie on such a place, and then the Tree will receive no harm. But if your Tree be young and thriving, then cut off the Boughs as close as you can, keeping the wounded place perpendicular to the Horizon, and be sure not to leave Elbows to receive the wet, as too many of our Husband-men do; for, the closer you cut off a Bough to the Page 41 Body, the sooner the bark covereth that place, therefore cut off the side-boughs of young Timber-trees close and smooth. I wish I could perswade all Lovers of handsome Timber-trees, at every Fall of their Woods to prune up all the Timber-trees; but then the Wood must not stand too long before it be fell'd. You may prune off boughs of ten years growth very well, and so every ten years; or oftner if it be in Hedg-rowes, prune up your Trees till you have got them to such a height as you find most convenient, viz. to fifty or sixty foot high: For I have many times observed Trees, of Oak, Ash, Elm and Beech, to have leading shoots sixty foot high and more, when they have had not above ten foot of good Timber; for Boughs have broke out at that height, and have so distributed the sap, that they were little worth, but for the Fire; when, if they had been pruned up as is before directed, you might have had the same height of good Timber; which, how much more profitable it would be, and also beautifull, I leave to any mans Judgement. The Ash and Beech cover the wounded place over soon, and seldom break out many side-boughs: The Elm very frequently breaks out side-boughs, yet will arrive to a great height of good Timber: the Oak is a little subject to break out side-boughs, and though a slow grower, yet by its own hardness of his Wood he preserves himself well till it hath over-grown the wounded place, which it will in a few years doe, if your Tree be young and thriving, and the boughs, not very great; for if the boughs be great, that place when they be cut off is such a Damm to the sap, that it forceth it to break out with many small boughs there; especially in such Trees as have a thick and rugged bark, as the Elm and Oak have when old. But if the Tree be young and thriving, then is the Bark thin and loose, and will more readily give way to the sap to ascend into the Head, and not break out into side-boughs; but if some few do break out, often pruning them close off will prevent that: But if you would be at a little more trouble, note this which I have found to be true, and your Timber shall pay you well for your pains. At Midsommer, after you have pruned up your Trees, take off all the small shoots that are broke out on the side of your Trees, close to the body of the Tree; do thus two or three years together, and you will find every year the side-boughs to be fewer and fewer, till you have a clear body, beautifull to behold, and profitable for as good Timber, thirty or forty foot or more, which otherwise would not have been a quarter so high. Thus may you make an Elm (which is a Tree most Image 30 (page 42) subject to break out side-boughs) as clear from boughs forty or fifty foot high, as they be. Your Oak that is young you may easily master, and bring it to a clear body; though it is some what troublesome in Woods, yet in Hedg-Rowes it may be practised with ease, or in Walks, or on single Oaks: But our Yeomen and Farmers are too much subject to spoyl such Trees as would make our best Oaks, by heading them, and making them Pollards. I wish there were as strict a Law as could be made, to punish those that do presume to head an Oak, the King of Woods, though it be on their own Land. By this means we should have the Farmer that is scanted in Wood, by often pruning off the side-boughs make many finer Trees than now there are; for in such places there is great food to make him a great Tree; and then in Coppices, if you let a Tree stand to be very great, it spoyls many a young one, and also your under-wood. But methinks I hear some opposing me, saying, that by so pruning up of Trees, they do not prove so well for the Joyner, Carpenter, Wheeler, &c. for they say, if the Tree doth over-grow the Knot, when they come to cleave such a Tree, that place proves faulty within, and the Timber is not so good. Secondly, They say, that cutting off the side-boughs, makes Trees more knotty. Thirdly, they say, that it makes a Tree decay sooner. To these three Objections I shall answer, and then hasten to conclude, and so leave my beloved Oak. I do grant, that if the Knots be great, though the Trees be young and thriving, and have covered the place over well, if you come to saw out such Trees for Plank, Board, or VVainscot, that there may be some Defect there where great boughs were cut off; but suppose there be, you have still the same length clear Timber at the lower end as you would have had if these boughs had not been cut off; and then by pruning up your Trees, they grow straighter, and your Tree carries a greater length of Timber, usefull for Beams, Summers, Raising, VVallplats, Rafters, Joyce, &c. and how much Timber these spend more than the other, viz. Board and VVainscot, &c. I leave you to determine. But my Advice is, not to let your boughs be great, but take them off from such Trees whilest young, and then the boughs will be young and small, and such Trees will cover such places in a little time, and these small Knots will not be perceived then, in case the Tree be sawn for VVainscot, &c. Page 43 Again, as to the first Objection, this seems to me a full Answer; as first, for such Trees as stand abroad single, you shall find them to have a clear body, of six, seven, eight or ten foot high, I only ask my Opponent, whether such a length of Timber had Knots on it or no? I hope they will grant it had; well then, how comes it to be so clear without Knots? Now I tell you, 'tis Cattle that crop off the boughs whilest they be young, and that makes it clear from boughs, and the sap mounts up higher, and there breaks out, which if it were but taken off as it is below, it then would be as clear sixty foot as it is at six, and as straight. This very Reason possess'd me so much, that it told me, an Elm (which is the most subject of any Tree to break out side-boughs) might be made clear Timber sixty foot high, as well as ordinarily they be six, by early, often, and Summer-pruning. This my Experience hath proved true. Again, a Thorn or VVhite-bush growing in a Park, and kept under by Dear cropping of it, for eight, ten or more years, so that it hath got a hundred little boughs, if it once get but a leading shoot, and that out of the Dears reach, all shall unite in that one, and that shall come to be a straight body, and straight-grained, notwithstanding it was so crooked below; for the lower ones will all die by the Dear cropping them, and the saps free ascending into the leading shoot. But as to the second Objection, I grant, that sometimes cutting off boughs, (especially great ones, and of Old trees) makes more, but then they be small; for the more a River is divided into small Rivulets, the easier those little ones are stopped and brought into one; for a great River must have a great Damme, and taking off a great bough is a great Damme to the sap; for the Tree falling suddenly narrow upwards, and the sap being used to spend it self there, and having free passage thither, when it is got into that place it breaks out on each side of the Knot, into many little boughs; but if you take off these little boughs that Midsommer, the Summer after there will be but a small quantity in comparison of the Spring-sap: And the bark being then loose, it makes the easier way for the Sap to ascend into the head, and not to break out into Boughs; and so having prepared the way by the Sap, that Midsommer-shoot will not be at a stand so much the Spring following. Or if the Spring after you have taken off the Boughs, you take off the little ones that were shot out the year before, and slit the bark above each Knot, that is, somewhat great down to the Knot; by so doing you may bring your Tree to have a clear Body, by a few years Image 31 (page 44) pruning; for I have Observed it usual in many Trees the Year they have been pruned up, for the Bark to have cracked an Inch or more; which tells you most plainly, that the pruning of Trees doth make them swell in Body, therefore help the pent places by slitting the Bark: you may often see this on your Ash, &c. Pray you, how comes it, that in your Coppices you shall have Timber-trees ten or twelve Foot high, clear, without Bough, and then the Tree break out all into head? It is (I am confident) the under-wood which smothers, and beats off the side-boughs as high as that grows, and so makes the Timber clear so high; also if you mark where high Timber-trees are, that have clear Bodies a great height, they do, or did stand thick together, and so one draws up another, smothering the side-boughs, and beating them off (sometimes) by their Motion in great Winds. Thus by what has been said of Cattels Cropping, Trees standing in Coppices, and by Trees standing thick together, you may Learn that you may do the same, and have Timber, by pruning, as clear from Knots, as it is by those Accidents. Thirdly, Whereas they say it makes a tree decay sooner; I grant this, that to prune off great Boughs from an Old tree, makes it decay sooner; for the Wounded place being great, and the Tree slow of growth, is a long time covering over that place (if it can be done at last) and that takes wet and Air, and decays the Tree; therefore I do not Advise you to take great Boughs off from any tree. But small Boughs cut off smooth, and close, from an Old tree or Young, causeth the tree to last longer, and to be clearer Timber: For when small Boughs are taken off from the side of your Tree, though Old, the Tree then not drawing much Sap, that little Sap doth most of it then ascend into the Head, and so makes the Head continue fresh and thriving the longer; and taking off the side-boughs makes the Tree to swell, and grow sooner into a great Body. For the Boughs that break out of the side have not such deep Root in the Body of the Tree, (I mean those that come forth after the Tree hath been once pruned) for every bough that breaks out, breaks out through the Bark, and hath its Root between the Bark and Tree that Year, and as the Tree increaseth, so that knot is deeper and deeper in the Body of the Tree: thus taking off the small Boughs often, keepeth the Tree clearer from great knots within the Timber, and the little knots do cover over so soon before the out-side of the knot be dead, that they become as clear Timber. Thus have I shewed you, that all sorts of Trees come to have clear Page 45 Bodies by pruning, either Natural or Artificial; that is by Cattel cropping, by under-wood beating off the side-boughs, or by standing close one to another, and so drawing up one another, and smothering the side-boughs by standing so thick, or by pruning, &c. Reader, if thy Faith hold out, Read on; But if you find you can't believe, be gone: For, with more ease a Man might undertake To bring Brute Bear unto the Fatal stake, Than him to Teach, whose Infidelity Does Demonstration, Reason, Truth defie. Thus have I shewed in part how to Raise and Order the Oak from the Acorn, till it is thirty or forty Years old. There is one thing more to be known, which is, how to Remove an Oak that is large (or other Tree) and that was never Removed before; I shall borrow part of it from the Learned Esquire Evelin's Discourse of Forest-trees, p. 13. Choose a Tree as big as your Thigh, saith he, (but if less, the better to grow) Remove the Earth from about him, cut through all the Collateral Roots, till with a Competent strength you can inforce him down upon one side, so as to come with your Ax at the tap root; cut that off, and cut all the Roots smooth on the under-side, re-dress your Tree, and so let it stand, covered about with the Mould you loosened from it, till the next Year, or rather longer, then take it up at a fit Season, and you will find it will (at those ends where the Roots were cut off) have drawn many tender young Roots, apt to take, and sufficient for the Tree wheresoever you shall transplant him: further to facilitate the Removal of such great Trees, or small ones that are ticklish to Remove, for the Adornment of some particular place, or the rarity of the Plant, there is this Expedient: A little before the hard Frosts surprise you, make a Trench about your Tree, at such distance from the stemme as you judge sufficient for the Roots; dig this so deep till you come lower than the side-roots, if your Ground be a dry Ground, water the Hill of Earth, the Frosts will lay hold on it the more, but commonly in Winter before Frosts we have showers saves you that Labour; then lay some Litter in the bottom of your Trench, which will keep that part from freezing, in case you have Occasion to undermine it more to loosen it when you take it up, as is very likely you will: Thus let it stand till some hard Frost do bind the Earth firmly to the Roots, and then convey it to the Pit or Hole prepared for its new station, having before covered the Earth by with some Horse-Litter to keep that Earth Image 32 (page 46) from freezing, which Mould will then be ready to cover that clod round the Root of the Tree, and the ends of the Roots, and so secure it the better; and that Litter will do well to lay round the Tree on the top of the Ground. But in case the Tree be very great, and the Mould about the Roots be so ponderous as not to be removed by an ordinary force, you must then have a Gin or Crane, such a one as they have to Load Timber with; and by that you may weigh it out of its place, and place the whole upon a Trundle or Sledge, to convey it to the place you desire; and by the afore-said Engine you may take it off from the Trundle, and set it in its hole at your pleasure. By this Address you may transplant trees of a great stature without the least Disorder, and by taking off the less of their Heads, which is of great Importance where this is practised, to supply a Defect, or remove a Curiosity. I do suppose that one of these small Cranes or Gins would be very useful to those that have a great many pretty big trees to take up in their Nurseries, especially such as have strong and tough Roots; for if the Ground were but well loosened round the Roots, and a Rope well fastened a little above the Ground to the stemme of the tree, I dare engage, that this way one Man with a Lever shall draw up more than ten Men: And besides, this will draw upright, which is better than drawing on one side, as many are forced to do. You must have on the lower end of the three Legs, pieces of Plank, to keep it from sinking too far into the loose Ground: I have now one a making, and hereafter I shall be able to give you a better Account of it than now; the onely Inconvenience I think of at present, is, in fastening the Rope about the Tree so, that it may not slide, or gall the tree; but a piece of good Leather, about four or five Inches broad, with three or four Straps to come through so many holes, when it is fastened to the Rope they may all be strained alike; this I suppose will do your work. The afore-said Learned Author Adviseth you, before you take up trees, to mark them all on one side, the better to place that side to point to the same Aspect it did before: For, Oaks growing on the North side of an Hill, are more Mossie than those that grow on the South-side: this I grant, because that side is Colder and Wetter; for it is Cold and Wet Ground that breeds Moss most, and that gets from the Ground upon the Trees: Also he says, that Apple-trees standing in a Hedge-row, after the Hedge was taken away, the Apple-trees did not thrive so well as they did before, for want of the shelter of the Hedge. I say, that if the Hedgerow had drawn up the Apple-trees so as to make them top-heavy, they might not thrive so well; but if they were not, the shelter being taken Page 47 away, they would thrive the better: unless by thriving he means growing in height: See Lord Bacon's Natural History, p. 113. For a tree pent up cannot spread. But as for placing the South-side of a tree South again, this is not to the purpose; for the greatest time that Trees grow in, is from the Suns entring into Aries to his entring into Libra; and all that time (that is, half a Year) the Tree hath the Sun on the North-side both Morning and Evening, and the North side hath the benefit of warming it self later in the Evening, and earlier in the Morning, having two hours time earlier, and two later in the height of Summer, more than the South-side: Again, you shall have the Cold be as much on the Southside of a Wall or Tree in the Night, as on the North, if the Wind blow on the South-side; therefore I do Judge that to place a Tree the Southside South again, signifieth little, though the same Author saith, p. 88. and the Author of the Book, Called [Mathematical Recreations] p. 75. saith, That a Tree groweth more on the South-side than on the North; I have oft Observed the Annual Circles, and have found as many, nay more, to the contrary; for thus I have always found, on a Tree near the Ground the Annual Circles have been the greatest on that side from which most of the great Roots came: As if a Tree grow on the South-side of a Bank, you shall find the Circles on that Tree to be greatest on the North-side, &c. but higher on a Tree the Circles are ever greatest on that side the Tree where there is a great Bough breaks out, for the Sap has great recourse thither; many times by sudden cold some is stayed by the way, and so increaseth that side of the Tree most. For I take the Sap of a Tree, if the Weather be open (that is, of those Trees that shed their Leaves) to be still ascending into the Head, though it be Mid-winter; though there do not rise enough to keep the Leaves on, nor to make it bud forth, yet it is plain that it keeps the buds full and fresh, and increaseth the growth of the Tree, for that same pory substance of the Tree which is between every Annual Circle that is made by the Winter-sap; and the milder the Winter is, the greater you shall find this to be, as is visible in Ash, Oak, Elm, &c. The other, which is more hard and clear, is increased by the Sap in Summer; and the more feeding the Summer is by showers, the more shall the Circles increase on dry Ground; and according to the Nature of the Ground that the Tree Loves, and the depth of the Soyl, so doth the Tree increase in these Circles and growth in all parts. Between these Annual Circles doth some Sap rise, as is plain in a tree that is Barked round, for that tree shall put forth Leaves and increase Image 33 (page 48) in Body, but produce little or no shoot, and the more porous the tree is between these Annual Circles, the longer that tree will Live, as accidentally I have had it Experimented on Walnut-trees, Ashes, &c. And they have continued sometimes two years, and sometimes near three before they have dyed, when they have been barked quite round the stemme, a Foot or more; and by way of Experiment I cut off the Bark from a Holly-tree and a Box-tree about half a Foot clean, quite round the stemme or body of each tree, and the tops of both did die in less than one years time, which informed my Reason, as much as though I had Learned it out of the most Learned Author, that the Sap of those trees that shed their Leaves, doth in a small quantity ascend between the Annual Circles, in that pory place: for trees that hold their leaves, their Wood is close, and Compact between the Annual Circles, and that is the Reason that they die soon, being barked round: Also their Sap being of a Turpentine and Clammy Substance, is the Reason they hold their Leaves all Winter, being as it were glued on by that Substance; and the Sap of such Trees as hold their Leaves, being once set by cold, requires a pretty deal of heat to make it thin, and set it on Motion: As Comparatively, a little Cold will set or make stiff Pitch or Turpentine; but it must be Frost that sets or stays the Motion of Water. Also those Trees which hold their Leaves will grow much better under the dropping of other great Trees, than those that shed their Leaves; for their Turpentine-sap shoots off the drops, so that they have little or no harm by such a Scituation, But in case you should have a Tree Barked round by Accident, and would willingly preserve it, your best way is to get a shoot below the wounded place, and if your Tree be Young, you shall then have several break out a little above the Root, if you find they shoot strong, preserve two of the strongest, and see that the Barked place be near the Ground; but if your Tree be Barked high from the Ground, or that it shoot up slowly, then leave but one shoot, keeping all other that shoot out clean taken off, as soon as ever you see them break out; so Nourish up the two shoots or shoot till you have got them higher than the wounded place; then cut a long slit in the Bark, above the wound, and joyn in that shoot exactly, making it fit the slit, the in-side of one bark right against the in-side of the other; tie it close in, and Loom it over with good and well tempered Loom, to keep the Air and wet out; or better with soft Wax. The Spring is the best Season, but if you fear your Tree to decay, defer not, but do it as soon as your shoots be shot long enough. If you would be further satisfied concerning the Largeness and Usefulness Page 49 of this Royal Tree, see Esquire Evelyn's Discourse of Foresttrees, who hath writ very well of this and others; but before I bid adieu, I must Plant these few unpruned Verses, and so leave the most Useful Oak. O Stately Tree! Who right can speak thy Praise Doth well deserve the Lawrel or the Bays. Ask but our Thames what Burdens thou hast bore Of Gold and Silver fine, and in their ore, Of Rubies, Diamonds, and Pearls most rare, With others which past valuation are. Of Silk and Sattins fine to Cloath the Back; Of Wines, Italian, French, and Spanish Sack: Of Spices, Fruits, and many a Rich Dye, To Satisfie and Feast the Curious Eye: Of Mastick, Myrrh, and many a Rich Gum; Alloes and Druggs which from the Indies come. He who Loves this thy Burthen, and not Thee, He deserves never to be worth one Tree. 'Twas Faithful Oak preserv'd our King, that we Might thence Learn Lessons of true Loyalty. Kings, Lords, and Earls, and Men of Low Degree, Transported are by this our Royal Tree; Oak-Walls our Seas and Island do inclose, Our Best Defence against our Forreign Foes. No thing on Earth but Oak can Time Redeem, No Wood deserving of so high Esteem. When in Salt Seas Sir Francis Drake did stear, Sailing in Oak he sav'd one day i'th' Year. His Oak which the Terrestrial Globe did Measure, Through Dangers led him t' Honour, Profit, Pleasure. No Wood like Oak that grows upon the Ground, To make our House and Ships last long and sound; No Oak like Ours: By Love to Oaks let's then Appear true Subjects, and right English-men.   Image 34 (page 50) CHAP. XI. Of raising and Ordering the Elm. THere are several sorts of Elm, but the best sort (because it produceth the greatest Trees, and soonest comes to perfection) is that which hath its Leaves not much less than Line, or Lime-tree leaves, and shoots with a shoot not much less than a Sallow when it is lopped: it is called by some the Trench-Elm, by others the Marsh-Elm. Some other sorts there are that are not much inferiour to this for producing high and good Timber. One sort there is that hath on the young shoots great pieces like Cork, subject to spread in head much, and grow crooked, this is not very good to make high Trees, but makes good Pollards: Another sort there is which I see in Essex, the sides are subject to have Wenns thick on them, which makes the Body hard to cleave: this is not very good to make a high Tree, but good Pollards. All sorts of Elms doe increase from the roots much of themselves; and the more you take, the more they will give, provided you keep them from being taken from you; that is, from being spoyled by Cattel, and though they be so kind of themselves, yet there are several wayes to increase them, but the way to have of the best Kinds, and to make the finest Trees, is by raising them of seeds. Therefore about the beginning of March, or about the tenth, you shall find the broad things like Hops begin to fall, which have the seed in them; when you find these begin to fall, in a dry day (if conveniently you can) gather what quantity you please to sow, then lay them thin in some place where they may drye four or five dayes, and then having prepared a Bed (in bigness according to the quantity of your Seeds) of fresh light Brick-earth, sow the seeds and their Vessels all over, then sift some of the same Mould all over the bed, for they will not well rake in; let them be covered about half an Inch thick; if the Summer prove drye, water them sometimes, and keep them clean from Weeds; let not weeds stand on your bed till they be great, lest in pulling such up you spoyl their spearing, by breaking it off, or by letting in the drye Aire, and so kill it; therefore keep your Beds clean from weeds, and about the middle or latter end of August they will be come Page 51 up: About the midst of September sift a little richer Mould all over the Bed, but not so much as to cover them, thus doe the next Summer, and take off the side "" boughs though young"
66,"A vindication of chymistry, and chymical medicines Courteous and candid reader, chymistry, is an art that doth both teach and inable us (for our exceeding good and benefit) to seperate purity from impurity; ...",1676-01-01,,"Image 1 (unnumbered page) Page 1 A VINDICATION OF CHYMISTRY, AND Chymical Medicines. Courteous and Candid Reader, CHYMISTRY, is an ART that doth both teach and inable us (for our exceeding good and benefit) to seperate Purity from Impurity; Exalt and advance what God and Nature hath given us, to a farther and higher Perfection than we receive it indewed with. For all Bodyes, more or less, partake of the Grossness and Terrestriety of their Matrixes: But after their essential purities are seperated from that Terrestriety adhering, which they drew from their Matrixes, they make it plain enough by their powerful effects, that it is to this state they ought to be reduced, before they work with Efficacy; and yet they still retain their Character and Internal Idea. Now if we shall well and truly consider it; what have we in this curious Nice Age, either for Back or Belly, Pleasure or Necessity, that hath not in some kind Image 2 (unnumbered page) Page 1 1 page duplicate	 Image 3 (page 2) or other been oblidged to Chymistry, and its beneficial Operations, for that perfection we receive it in? What Calling may be said to have attained to the perfection and hight it now Glories in, without its help in some one or other of its (more sublime or trivial Operation. Consider our Bread our Beer, Wine, Meat, &c. Or whatever can render our lives happy or satisfactory: And you will find it in one degree or other to pass under the hand of Chymistry, and its various Operations, or Preparations. And can we then be thus Insensibly led to admit its dayly help and assistance in things of smallest value; and can we be so stupid, dull, ignorant and blind, as to neglect its assistance in things of greater moment and concern? And not only neglect its friendly advice, but deny its profitable hand in those things, which above all others we most need its help in? Nay, we do not only deny it makes us happy; but we seek by all means possible to disgrace, slander, and make it (and its Professors) contemptible and odious to the whole world. Doubtless these are great follies, and we declare our selves either very ignorant, or else very Malitious and selfended. Can we with ease and content, admit and allow its favours, (and greedily seek after them) to improve and maintain our Purses and Pleasure, and cannot we admit and embrace its help for the preservation of our Health; without which the other will be of little benefit, and less pleasure? Consider, if Nature be weakned and oppressed, that she cannot accept of her usual and accostomed Food; so as she would, and ought to dispose of it for the supply of her Spirits, and maintaining of her Habitation; and if she cannot in her ordinary course, so play the Chymist, as usual: Doubtless, Page 3 she is less able to do it, in that which the very name, as well as the nature of it, makes her utterly to abhor, and reject; and if she be not strong enough to seperate the Essenses of her dayly and accustomed Food, how shall she Extract any thing from her Physick (if given gross) that may give her that rerelief, which her present condition requires and calls for? She [viz. Nature] hath a double work to perform: First, to Extract the Essential part (and to make use of it) and secondly to cast off the Gross as an enemy. It would doubtless, therefore (in this ease) be far better to save her the labour of seperation in this her weakned condition: For although Nature her self when in health, can digest her Food (when Dressed) and seperate the Alimental parts to her self, (and make use of it for Sustentation) and cast off the Gross as useless: Yet her Medicines must be Pure, Digested and seperated, and fited for her use: for if she cannot Digest her Food, then not Gross Medicines; her Food when in health may be Gross, because she can dispose of it to advantage; but when Diseased, her Physick must be pure, seperated and fit for her use, viz. To Joyn with the Spirit, or Natural life in man. And in this the Physician is rightly stiled, Natures Handmaid; but not for loading her with more Impurities, but in assistng and helping her to cast off Impurities, by that which is Pure. For of Necessity, either the Physician or Nature must officiate, or act as Chymist, before she can have, or receive what she calls for, and requires for her help and assistance. Who therefore not drowned in Ignorance and Envy, would so strongly oppose so great a Good as Chymistry is Author of? For this is the only Art (which by supplying us out of the light of Nature, with Convenient means and particular Image 4 (page 4) Natures to seperate the pure from the impure) will teach us: First, to heal all Diseases of the Macrocosmical substances, and afterwards by examples and experiments deduced from those exteriour Cures, will shew us the right and infallible Cure of Diseases in our own Bodies. He that knows not how to purge and heal Metals, how can he restore the decay'd, or weakned Radical Balsom in Man, and repair it by Comfortable and Concordant Medicines, to perform perfectly all its appointed functions; which must necessarily be put into action, before any Disease can be expelled: He that knew not what that is in A, which purges Gold, how can be come by an effectual and Wholsome Medicine that will purge and cast out those Extrarious peccant causes that afflict and destroy the Body of Man? He that knows not how to fix Arsenick, or to take away the Corrosive nature of a Sublimate, or to Coagulate Sulphureons Spirits; and by a convenient Specifical Medium to break and dissolve Stones in the greater World, will never in the body of man allay and tame the Arsenical Spirits of the Microcosmic Salt, nor take away the Venimous indispositions of Sulphur, nor dissolve the Stone in the Bladder, and drive it out being dissolved. Now as the Antient Phylosophers; who knew Nature indeed, obtained their noble Medicines by the strict and exact observation of Nature in her own path; how that kind was multiplied by kind, and without putrifaction there could be no Generation: And as they found excellent Medicines, by doing all things in the Metallick Kingdom according to the possibility of Nature: So if you would have a Medicine indeed, although inferiour to theirs, whether of the Mineral, Animal, or vegetable kingdom, you must proceed in the same method; for as kind is multiplyed by kind, and not without putrefaction; so if you will exalt any concrete to make it a friendly Medicine, it must be in Natures path; Kind Page 5 with kind, and that by putrifaction. For the absolute things requisite to one that would conscionably undertake the Sick; are first to know how to unlock those Medicinal Bodies which the Almighty hath created, and how to prepare them, and when, and to whom to apply them; and also how to order and dispose the Patient, so as that he may reap that good from them, which by carefull administration of them is expected. And thus will a little quantity of such a well prepared Medicine, manifest it self in the powerful operating and friendly assisting of Nature, to cast off her Enemies (viz. Diseases) with speed and safety. But on the contrary, how loathsome is the very name of (gross and ill prepared Physick unto debilitated Nature! And what's the reason? Doubtless, the hard task she hath had put upon her by it, and even when she is least able to perform it, and hath more need of succour, than of a farther trouble. Alas, how shall she receive so great a portion of loathsom Medicines, being weak when even in the greatest of her strength she would (not only) be troubled to take (but also at the sight of) it! and this from a secret sense and antipathy, her natural life or spirit hath against its nausceating, and dull Quality, as well as the greatness of its Quantity. Then certainly Nature hath no greater help, nor better remedy, then that true and friendly Spagerick Art or seperater of the Impure, from the Pure and Medicinal part, that so renders it apt, and fit, for her more easie and friendly Reception. Why then should any so Obstinately oppose so clear a truth, and so great a Good as this Excellent Art of Chymistry, in the preparation of Medicines (if compared with the other gross, sluggish and ineffectual foundation of Physick) or why do the Galenists cry out against others in things Image 5 (page 6) they understand not? Or why do they Envy us, and speak against our Art, (by which we prepare Pure and harmless Medicines) and yet make use of those unnatural Chymical Medicines, prepared by the power of violent corrosive Fires, Destructive to Nature. Our way of preparing vegetable specificks, is by friendly Dissolvents as are in themselves agreeable to the Nature of the thing acted upon, so that in seperation the whole Essence of the Concrete is preserved both volatile and fixed, in Odour, Taste and Collour, and the Drossy gross part cast away. I say why do they make use of Oyl of Vitrial Salt Brimstone, and that dangerous Vomit @ Vitae prepared of that high Exalted Poyson, viz. Oyle, or Butter of A also why do they use, Crocus Metallorum, prepared Steel, Crocus Martis, Flos Sulph. Lapis Infernalis, ? Dulcis (falsly so called) Sacharum D, Tarbith Minerals (that hellish fluxing Preparation of Mercury) with many other of those churlish unnatural  in the London Dispensatory: Also why do they use Chymical Oyls, and Salts of Herbs, Seeds, Berries, Spices, Barke, Woods, Wax, Rozins, Minerals and Stones� with their Compound and simple Distilled Waters, all unnaturally seperated from their other parts, or principles, as their late learned unlearned W. calls them. Doth Nature use these Fires in producting these Natural subjects they thus work upon? (No) Neither must her Children in their Art of Melioration. She uses Fire 'tis true, but 'tis her own, and it is she that furnishes the true Son of Art with his Fire, which is Gentle. Does she seperate the Salt Sulphur and Mercury, (in her Acts of Generation) and afterwards joyn them again. No, she Ferments, Putrifies, Digests, Vivifies and performs all her work and acts of Generation, Page 7 with one only Fire which Varies the Species according to the Matrix, &c. What can you Gentlemen say for your selves, that have followed the subtile Doctrine of the Athenians, rather then the plain path of Nature, but do you glory in the Art of your Masters. We will rejoyce in the works of our Tutress Nature, whose Excellency will appear as well by reason, as dayly Experience. Consider, what is it that gives Eminency and Perfection, to any one thing we esteem as Excellent; we shall find that it is the Purity of it, and that either in the Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral Nature: If we consider then what we are speaking of, viz. Medicines prepared Chymically; we must also conclude its Efficacy and Excellency to proceed from its Purity, or Purified Nature. Let us (I say) consider what it is for, it is to help and restore decayed Nature and her languishing Spirit. Now this Spirit is the most subtile part of Man (I mean not the Rational Soul) therefore no way to be assisted, but by that which is of Purity and likeness with it (viz. Medicines of a subtile penetrating Nature.) The Consideration of Nature will tell you, what her Medicines ought to be, and a true consideration of such Medicines, will teach and tell you, what Nature is, so that the quality of the one will inform you what the Nature and Essence of the other ought to be; for the Physician must (if he will Cure a Disease) Administer his Medicines to the Spirit, because the Spirit is the sole Dispencer of Guifts to all the parts and faculties of the body; now as to the Quality of the Midicines you ought to use for Natures relief, and assistance, is, that they ought to be of most subtile and thin parts. Therein lyes the excellency of Chymical Medicines, above others, this Art being able Image 6 (page 8) to Exalt the most dull and inactive Medicines, to the greatest of subtility, and far beyond what nature presents them to us in. Nor doth it thus Exalt their Purity and Efficacy, as to Cure all Diseases both inward and outward only, but Renders the Medicine it self Incorruptible also: whilst the best of Galenical (Mixtures) will hardly keep a year. How then should these poor Dirty, Drossy Medlies, answer those great Ends they Administer them for? And how shall they root out inveterate, fixed and Chronick Diseases? How shall they purifie the Impure, or help the Infirm, who are not Cured of their own Crude, corrupt and infirm condition? If any shall here object, that the Galenick Medicines are safe and the Chymical quickly Cure, or quickly Kill: Let such objecters know, that they grant, and add more to the praise of Chymistry and Chymical Medicines then they are aware of; for nothing can quickly Cure but what is Efficacious, and fitted for so great a good, which nothing can be, that is not in some measure pure and like unto the nature it shall so assist. Herein do they unawares affirm the Excellency of such Medicines: and then to those that suggest, they as suddainly Kill, I must thus answer them, that they cannot Kill, if administred by skilful Operators (as those must be that know their true preparation) for as Fire will warm at a fit distance; yet if any man shall (to warm another) apply a red hot Iron to his flesh, it will burn him� So water will wash a man clean, (if dirtied) and he therefore unadvisedly leap into a deep Well, he may be Drowned. Wine will cheer the heart, if moderately taken, yet many by excess have Killed themselves; but this cannot be attributed to the dangerous, or Killing quality of the Wine, as Wine. So these Medicines we know, use and extoll, if administred, Page 9 or taken by Pints, may destroy Life: But if taken by Drops, Drams, or Spoonfulls, in their Vehicles, they Enliven and help nature to Conquer her Enemies, viz. Diseases. When other Gross, Sluggish and ill prepared Nauseating Mixtures, serve only to stuff up the body (already too much obstructed) with such quantities, which rather hinder then further her own operation, and also to rob Nature of that praise due to her (and the Author ofher) when she hath overcome, both the evil of the Disease, and such Medicines. Now having briefly (and I hope to the satisfaction of every unbyased and candid Reader) vindicated Chymistry, and true Chymical Medicines; I shall also with the like brevity, give the Reader an account of some Excellent Useful Chymical Medicines prepared by me; which may be of great benefit to all Honest Physicians, Chyrurgions, Apothecaries, Midwives, and others who design good, and desire to be serviceable to their Generation.

These Excellent Specificks, are all prepared by proper Dissolvents, by which the Volatile and fixed parts are presverved with their Odour, Tincture and Colour, so that what Nature is best pleased with, is here fitted for her reception, that she may dispose of them, for those great uses and ends they were designed, &c.   Reader, I have not given you a full relation of the uses and Vertues of those before mentioned Essences. Therefore I add this; Image 8 (page 12) Whatever is, or may be attributed to any Vegetable, the same and more may be attributed to the Essence of that Vegetable, for by how much it is exalted in Purity; by so much it ecceeds in Vertue and Excellency. And as these noble Remedies are Purer, (then the other common Gross Mixtures, which are usually given in great quantities) so must their Dose, viz. 5. 10. 15. or 20 Drops in VVine, Beer, Ale, Sider. Tee, Coffee, or Broth, 3 or 4 times a day, that the active penetrating subtile parts of the Medicine, may expel the Evil, Obnoxious Diseasy Matter, and so restore decayed strength, and bring Nature again into her true Path, by which she may preserve the whole man in health. Thus having hinted unto you the Excellencies of true prepared Vegetable Essences, and their safety above others: I shall also speak a little to Mineral Preparation, and so conclude the first part. Mineral Medicines have a more universal tendency then Vegetables, they being higher graduated in Nature, and more fixed, and more locked up, and harder to come at, for prudent Nature hath put Bolts and Bars upon her best Jewels, and hath made strong Fences about them lest strangers should espay them, and steal them away, and make an ill use of them, and cry they are ours, and Nature shall obey us, she is our servant, and we will do what we please with her. Therefore she keeps the Keys of her Treasuries her self, but she will vouchsafe to lend them to such of her Children as are willing to be instructed by her, and will promise alwayes to walk in her path, and perform whatever she commands; I say, such a one, and no other, will she fet into her Chambers of Beauty and Riches, but he that hath her Keys, which are friendly Adjuncts, may open Mineral bodyes, and extract that solar tincture, which she hath Page 13 planted in them; for it is this solar Tincture, which is so amicable to Nature; and Cures the most Radicated Diseases, by Enlightning and Enlivening the natural spirit, by which Nature comes both to see her Errours, and amend her Wayes; being thus enabled, not only to cast off all offending Matter formed in the body, but also changing those Venoms, the cause of such Matter"

Your most humble Servant, Robert Turner.   Unnumbered page To the Reader, Whose Studies are seasoned with Salt. WHEN the rude dark Chaos, and indigesta moles, lay tumbling in darkness, and rowling amongst the undivided waters; when the Spirit of the Great Eternal Elohim, moved above Image 6 (unnumbered page) the Face thereof, it seemed good to his Great creating power, to make a Witness of his Glorious Majesty, by framing the spatious �niverse: then did he pronounce a fiat Lux, Let there be Light: and no sooner was his will declared, but Light immediately, like a ready swift-wing'd Herald, soon proclaim'd his Embassage to the as-yet unseparated Fire, Air, Earth and Water: Unnumbered page and they, as dutiful Subjects, yield ready Obedience to his Glorious Commands; and Light speedily muzzles up darkness, and presents the Creator with a new baptized morning. His sacred Power further intending to manifest his Glory, commands a divorce between the Earth and Water; and as a mighty Monarch doth his conquered Enemy, or Image 7 (unnumbered page) stubborn Rebel; so he with another fiat, makes that terrible, boundless, fathomless Element, the Sea, become his Prisoner; and confines her swelling waves to their bounds and borders; banishing them from one end of the World to the other, to run up and down in an unsettled motion; that though her brinish Mountains swell never so high, yet further then his great fiat permits, Unnumbered page they never dare approach. Then after he had vanquished this terrible (to poor mortals apprehension) adversary, he soon bespreads the Earth with a green robe, embroyder'd with such variety of glorious flowers, as the greatest Potentate on the earth, with all his Glory, could never attain to the like array. Moreover, did his refulgent Majesty yet further illustrate the Image 8 (unnumbered page) beams of his glorious might in bedecking the bespangled azure skies with those powerful Creatures the Sun, Moon, and Stars, which he set for times and seasons, days, months and yeers; and to divide betwixt day and night: to omit the ready obedience, the Sea, Air, and Earth yielded, in bringing forth fishes, birds and beasts, immediately at his command. Whither now doth Unnumbered page my wandring Muse soar? What royal Potentate or princely Guest, should now be expected to this glorious Entertainment? Not the Mighty Angels, that excel in strength; but the great Deity, call'd a triune Council, & commanded the Earth also to bring forth an Epitomy of all his voluminous works, the Manual of his glory, Man, a naked puling Creature, born without Sword or Image 9 (unnumbered page) Shield; yet into his Soul did the All-eternal breath the Image of Himself, crown'd him glory, made him little lower then the Angels, made him Commander of Earths Empire, gave him an os sublime, a lofty countenance, to view the Stars, and learn to know their powerful influence upon the inferiour World. Now doth the wise Philosopher, he who is a true Unnumbered page contemplator of the divine Wisdom, by a threefold operation, and threesold matter, make his creation, and erect the fabrick of his world, with his Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury. The Mercury & Sulphur of the Philosophers, hath much been written on, more then needs talk'd on; but the third and chief principle, was as yet unsupplied. Here, Reader, it is fully Image 10 (unnumbered page) discussed, and to the intelligent and deserving, will be a great revealed Secret: despised by fools, crack'd on by bragging knaves; who indeed like degenerate bastards, unframe the frame, & blot the manual, and deface the Glorious Image of the Almighty. Some seek to fill the insatiate Gulf of their unfathom'd wills, in vain pleasure: Another seeks to mount the slippery stairs Unnumbered page of staggering honor, and to make a perpetuity of his off-spring: Another digs in the Earth, and is shipwrack'd with covetous dunghil-passions. The actions of all these are not a whit tinctured with the true Salt of the Philosophers; for therein is no such thing. Many indeed there are to whom the Philosophers Study seems ridiculous, because their unseasoned Image 11 (unnumbered page) brains cannot apprehend the great mystery thereof: to them I will not bestow time to say a word; nor here tell you the Vertues of Salt: yet you see our natural vulger common Salt will preserve dead flesh from putrefaction: What then will the true-prepar'd Philosophical Salt do? It is not meet to tell you here; but if you are worthy of it, the Book will; and Paracelsus told you already. Unnumbered pageLet me intreat you to take notice by the way, that when you finde any mention made of heaven, earth, soul, spirits; or our heaven, &c. these are not meant the celestial heaven, or natural earth; but terms used by the Philosophers, to obscure their sayings from the wicked; spoken with all due and holy reverence to the divine Majesty; of whose glorious Attributes, the true Philosophers Image 12 (unnumbered page) and Astrologers are as tender as CLassical John can be; yet this I thought good to mention, being cautious lest any spark of my flint should touch the wild-fire of his beacons; but that my Salt may rather preserve the hopes of my intelligent Reader, to dive through his Studies, to his crown'd haven: with which desire I conclude, 22 Decemb. 1656.

Image 2 (unnumbered page) Unnumbered page The Authours Epistle. TO THE HONOURERS OF Natural Light. AFter I had lately with-drawn my self from publick employments, & reprieved my Soul from the dangerous attendants of a COURTIER's life, and Image 3 (unnumbered page) had now ancor'd my thoughts in a blest retirement, I alwayes had resounding the Eccho of that poetical passage in mine ears: Here is the Freedom the Soul gains, Enfranchiz'd from her golden Chains. Now began I to feel those thoughts of Natural Philosophie, alwayes fostered by me, though till now, as it were ill attended, to give a fresh and sprightly Spring in my Soul. I could not but upon their return, give them a wonted and merited Well-come, Unnumbered page that I might by the gain of this inward and natural Light, repair my voluntarie ressignment of that outward and deceitfull splendour: Besides, by this course, I had hopes to wipe off a publick guilt, for now did I apprehend the charge of a desertour of publick employments, and of the Laws of my Countrie likely to fall upon me, therefore lest this might issue a deep censure, I fled to that Sanctuarie, the Studie of the Occult, and almost unsearchable Laws and Customes of Nature in the Universe, the common Countrey Image 4 (unnumbered page) of all, hoping a securitie in this studie, and a protection from this Policie. For certainly civil Constitutions will not decree any remarkable Amercement upon him, who laying down the burden of those Troubles, doth retire himself to the general service of the World. Now was my Soul rowling within it self thought concerning the Sovereigntie, Lawes, Order, Government, Harmonie, Effects, Causes, yea, the unconceiveable Riches of Nature; now indeed was I lost in admiration of these, which astonishment, Unnumbered page though it be an evidence of ignorance, yet it is also an incentive to knowledge, for it causeth the Soul to soar above, by which it is enkindled with a burning desire to know what it is, as yet ignorant of, though affected to. My Soul being thus enflamed, brought several philosophical Constitutions to a severe Text, and upon the touch, assented not to their Veritie, because Nature did seem to dart some weak and waining Light, as it were breaking forth upon the confine and border of a scarcely Image 5 (unnumbered page) discerned Truth, till at length, the Light began so to rise, as to break through the encompassing Fogs, and to break into my Soul, whereby it was not onely made more resplendent, but also more confident, not onely to view the ground, but also to dig for the Treasure. The first Errours of the Ancients, and which are the worst and radicall Errours that came into my thoughts, were those concerning the Principles of Nature, concerning the first Matter and that Universal Form, from which all things flow, concerning Unnumbered page the Number of the Elements, their Qualities, their Opposition, Scituation, Reciprocation; when I had seriously turned these within my thoughts, I layed hold of an Opinion different from the Current; neither was the authoritie of ancient Philosophers, nor their ingenious, but unsatisfactorie reasonings, able to divert my mind from that perpetual devotion, in which it stood to the light of Nature. So now what I first admired, I now affected, yea, that Love, which hath no weapons but fierie rayes, strook my soul into Image 6 (unnumbered page) a flame, to enter into the most secret and sacred rooms of Nature. But I was long in a suspensive Dispute with my self, whether it were my dutie to communicate to you, the Students of Philosophie, those secrets I have found, suspicious lest it might prove a disgust to you, a danger to my self; for I found Experience the best Counsellour to give me warning to be wise by the folly of others, and to learn to stand by their falls; for I alwayes was musing how many had wrackt their credit by scribling, how Unnumbered page our modern Wits are close in their commendations, but lavish enough in their detraction of other mens labours, how attempting their souls are in fancying and fostering follies, how obstinate in the retaining a conceived Truth; yea, I considered it was not onely a project of difficultie, but also of danger, to pull up a received and an acknowledged Opinion, and to implant a new and divers. But in this Conflict, (Ye most ingenious Assertours of Natural Light) the victorie fell upon the love of you, and Image 7 (unnumbered page) of Truth, so that I was determined, that since those had been the Motives to the Disquisition of these Truths, they should also be the Incentives to their publication. Yet let me have this Boon granted, that if you will be competent or just Judges, let not the swoln names of Plato, Aristotle, and of any other prime Philosophers, be summoned as convicting witnesses; or empannell'd as a condemning Jury, but lay aside their nominal, though seemingly real authority, and bind not your souls to a continued credulity of their positions; Unnumbered page but preserve your Souls free to your selves. In the reading of the learned Monuments of former Ages, let not the popular fancy of their general Applause, bewitch you into a blind Belief of all their Notions. Far be it from me to stain their Credit, or detract from their Learning, who alwayes had exhibited by me almost a Divine Adoration, there is no earthly glory competible to theirs: they were the Men that first took infant Philosophie into their arms, and nourished it up to so incredible a strength and Image 8 (unnumbered page) stature, that those lofty souls seemed to have cut off from succeeding Ages, the hope of an Addition to their Labours, and to an advancement of Learning. Yet as for the deep search of the winding creeks of Nature, and for the exquisite knowledge of her concealed Mysteries, the growing Age of Philosophie, even in its own judgement, did not comprehend them, these were brought forth by the fertile Brains of future Times, they brought to light Obscurities, they polish'd rough-hewn principles, they propt up perplexities. Unnumbered page So did Knowledge get its accomplishment by Age, and Truth its perfection by Time, which demonstrates the vigour of our present years, and that the number of things we know, is far less than of those of which we are ignorant. Philosophy is not like a Garment, as that age should wear it or worse it, and they that pretend a gray head to their errours, by this seek not so much to patronize it, as to discredit it. Forbear I beseech you, by an unadvised censure, to condemn me without plea, if I Image 9 (unnumbered page) shall seem to unsettle the boundaries of Philosophy, be not angry, and accuse me as sacrilegious, but consider whether I do not aym at their settlement rather than otherwise? whether I do not rather confirm than weaken her priviledges? whether I do not rather honour than impayr her Royalty? upon which grounds I hope She will, as by way of requital, not deny me her assistance, as a buckler against the delusions of Sophisters, and a breast-plate against the environed darts of either Envy or Ignorance. These Beasts will bark, the Unnumbered page first pining at anothers good, the second raging in its own clouds, both break into the cultivated Gardens of Knowledge, and the delightfull paradise of Philosophy, and either snip or blast the endeavours of a more fortunate Genius. These to no purpose strive to stop my course by their frights, I am seated above their highest reach; as long as I can see the Deity of Truth, under her patronage I walk, I work secure. Onely be you pleased to accept these sprinklings of my retirement, with the same soul it is presented, if any thing seem in Image 10 (unnumbered page) it to disrellish, deal so gently as that you may seem rather not to comply, than wholly to refuse. I shall in the interim reach my end, if my pains shall cause you to fall upon greater attempts with better success.    Unnumbered page Image 11 (unnumbered page) Page 1 Enchyridion Physicae Restitutae. OR, A Summary of the Physicks Recovered. THE FIRST RULE. GOd is an Eternal Being, an infinite Oneness, the radical Principle of all things, whose Essence is an incomprehensible Light; his Power, Omnipotency; whose beck is an absolute act. He that dives deeper, is swallowed up in a trance and silence, and is lost in the abyss of unfathomed glory. 2. Most of the Ancients conceived the world from eternity to have been figured in its Archetype, and Image 12 (page 2) Original, which is God, who is all Light: before the Creation of the Universe he was a book rowld up in himself, giving light onely to himself; but, as it were, travailing with the birth of the world, he unfolded himself, and that work which lay hid in the womb of his own mind, was manifested by extending it to view, and so brought forth the Idaeal-world, as it were in the transcript of that divine Original, into an actual and material world. This is hinted by Trisgmegist,In Pimand. when he says, That God changed his form, and that all things were in a sudden revealed and brought to light. For the world is nothing else but the disclosed image of an occult Deity. This beginning of the world the Ancients seem to have denoted by the birth of their Pallas, out of the brain of their Jupiter, by the Mid-wiffery of Vulcan, that is, by the help of divine fire or light. 3. The eternal Parent of all things, not less wise in governing, than powerfull in creating, did so orderly dispose the whole organical frame of the world, that the highest are so intermixt Page 3 with the lowest, and the lowest interchangeably and inconfusedly with the highest, and have an Analogical likeness, so that the extreams of the whole work by a secret bond, have a fast coherence between themselves through insensible mediums, and all """"""""gs do freely combine in an obedience to their Supream Ruler, and to the benefit of the inferiour Nature, onely being subject to a dissolution at the will of him who gave them their constitution. Wherefore it is well said of Hermes,In Smarag. Tab That whatsoever is below, hath an assimulation to somewhat above. He that transfers the sovereign order of the Universe to any Nature diverse from the Nature of God, denies a God. For it cannot be just to conceive any other uncreated Deity of Nature, as the Cause of the production or conservation of the seve""al Individuals of this large frame of ""he world, besides that spirit of the ""ivine Worker"

But (O most iust God) after his fall, death crept in as it were a leaprosie, and the Image of God was darkened, blemished, and almost blotted out: Yet by thy mercifull goodnesse O God, this Image is repaired by thy gospell, because wee be renewed by faieth into the hope of euerlastyng life, that wee maie liue in God, and with GOD, and maie bee one with hym. And whereas man after the eatyng of the Apple forbidden, had the knowledge of good and euill, yet the euil men doe detaine thy trueth O God, in vnrightuousnesse, and doe refuse thy vocation and callyng, which by thy trueth doest continually call vs vnto thee, yet this thy trueth naturally grafed in vs continually doeth indeuour as much as it may to appere in action, but it is let and hindered by concupiscence, which some say is in the nether part of the soule� others say it is in brutali spiritu or Anima, therfore thou hast giue vs, O God, that what we knowe, we study to make manifest & shewe forth, which if we doe not wee be reproued by our owne iudgement: for the better part of the Soule or Spiritus, which some call sinteresis, Unnumbered page doeth perswade to that is good. Hereby appeareth the wonderfull power and strength of conscience: which in great offenses cannot be perfectly quieted. Wherefore, it is written, the Gentiles which haue not the lawe, by nature, doe the workes of the lawe, and doe shewe the worke of the law written in their hearts: their conscience bearing the witnesse: their thoughts either accusing or defending them. This propertie to perswade to doe good, some call sinteresis, which thy word calleth conscience, which is a liuing lawe, which cryeth, stirreth, and moueth to doe good: for thou O God, art so mercifull and good to vs, that thou hast giuen this knowledge to our minde: which like a Schoolemaster doth instruct and teach vs: so that coscience, is as it were a certaine lawe in thinges subiect to sence and reason. But (O good God) omnipotent, Aristotle his heathnish Philosophie, very absurdly teacheth, that all the Orbes, be bodies subiect to no corruptio, and that they and their motions be eternall: and he assigneth to certaine myndes, Intelligentis, or vnder straunge natures and essenties, and seperated their seuerall and singuler motions of the sayd Orbes: And he assigneth one Orbe to the high God, which is moued by him. Whereby he maketh all those essenties seperated, among who Image 6 (unnumbered page) those Orbes are distributed to bee equall and like substaunce: but he alloweth that mynde or essence which is the elder: that is, God to bee onely so much the more excellent then the rest, by how much the orbe assigned to him, is more excellent then the other Orbes. That Philosophie also teacheth, that it is an absurde thing and against reason, to say that any thing eternall had any beginning: therefore because those Orbes be eternal they had no beginning. Likewise, it teacheth that God medleth not vnder the Moone, and that he is not the maker nor the creatour of any thing, but onely the mouer of the heauen: and it maketh God to be the finall cause onely of motions, and not of the nature of ech seueral thing: neither doth his Philosophie teach any agent cause of those thinges which it affirmeth to be eternall.

MY LORD, IT may seem very improper to address a Translation out of French to Your Lordship, who have spent so many years to the greatest advantage in France, and who is not only a Great Master of that Gentile Language, but of all the more eminent modern Languages of Europe. But those Image 3 (unnumbered page) who have the Honour to know any thing of Your Lordship must needs allow, that no Dedication of what is �seful to the world, or Learned in any kind, can be more properly tendered than to a Person who being born in the Highest Rank of our Nobility, has Power to Patronize whatsoever he takes into his Protection, and who being fully replenished with all the admirable accomplishments, which a mighty Genius, a penetrating and vigorous �nderstanding, an early and exemplary Virtue and Piety, and all sorts of Foreign and Domestick improvements could bestow; in order to render Your Lordship either a Great Minister in affairs of State, Unnumbered page a Compleat Courtier, an Eminent Patriot in the time of Peace, a Valiant and Judicious Commander in the time of War, or an excellent Judge both of Men and Books. My Lord, the Treatise I now offer You, is not writ after the usual way of ordinary Chymists; it has none of the bombastick expressions, nor ridiculous pretences, none of the Melancholick Dreams, and wretched Enthusiasms, none of the palpable falsities, and even impossibilities wherewith the common rate of Chymical Books has been stuff'd heretofore. The Author is no Believer in that great and unhappy stumbling-block, the Mystery of Projection, nor at all addicted Image 4 (unnumbered page) to the Transmutation, or rather Adulteration of Metals. He is an excellent Operator, his Reasonings are close and pertinent to the matter in hand, and all deduced from matter of Fact; insomuch that I think he may be said to have Purified and Refined Chymistry from the many dregs and feculencies, which by other mens over-refining, and over-curious diligence it had been tainted with before. I shall not trouble Your Lordship too much with things so unsuitable as these are, considering that Your Noble Soul, and Publick Spirit is hourly engaged in serving, and becoming highly useful to your Countrey upon the Unnumbered page greatest occasions. Your Lordship had a considerable share in the happy conclusion of this Summers Campaign, with Your most Illustrious Father, his Grace my Lord Duke of Beaufort, who did maintain, by his Presence, and Wise Conduct, that great Post of the utmost importance, the City of Bristol, against the power of the Rebels, who confidently gave out that they were sure of Bristol, and doubtless might have been so, unless prevented by the Wisdom and Courage of His Grace, and Your Lordship. These things, My Lord, are but the beginning of what the World is to Image 5 (unnumbered page) expect from You, and may now very reasonably promise it self, under the auspicious Government of our most Potent, and most Invincible Monarch. What great thing may not reasonably be presumed, when the Head and Body are so admirably fitted for the Conquest of the World! and the rather, now the Body is so well Purged from the sowre Leaven of Intestine Rebellion. May Your Lordship long continue to partake of His Majestie's Royal Favour, and to Ennoble the most Illustrious House of the Somersets, with thousands of gallant Actions, worthy Your self, and Unnumbered page worthy Your high Descent from some of the Greatest Men in the World, for many Generations past. I am, MY LORD, Your Lordship's most Humble, and most Obedient Servant, WALTER HARRIS.   Image 6 (unnumbered page) Unnumbered page THE PREFACE. I Shall easily acknowledge that the world is in no want of Chymical Books; Germany alone can sufficiently furnish those who are much inquisitive after them, with as great variety as their heart can wish. And yet in this great plenty, or rather superfluity of Books of Chymistry, when we have weighed things a little maturely, we shall find that something very material is still wanting, in order to render Chymistry of good use to the World; and that is, to give a just and impartial judgment of the benefits and the mischiefs, the safety and the danger of many great and common, but Image 7 (unnumbered page) those very Active Chymical Medicins, according to the proper use, or irregular application of them, and according to the innocence, or destructiveness of their composition. In order to this end, I do conceive that this Author's plain and natural way of examining every Operation by Reason and Experience together, his singular perspicuity in his Discourses and Remarks, and his universally avoiding all Imaginary Notions in the explication of the accidents and circumstances which do attend the Operation, may be a good foundation upon which some Judicious Practisers may hereafter raise cautions & instructions of excellent use to mankind. This Author is one of the first through-pac'd Chymists who has had the ingenuity and sagacity to suspect the influence of Fire on the chief Preparations made with it. For Unnumbered page though Chymistry has by some been called Pyrotechnia, or the ART of FIRE, and Fire has seemed to be as much deified by most Chymists, as Scaliger tells us, Exercit. 258. it was by the barbarous Lybians, who did worship it as a God; yet this worthy man has in many places of his Book abundantly acknowledged, or at least sufficiently hinted at the hurt, as well as the good, which medecins may receive from its violent nature. He says, p. 21. If we consider impartially how Fire does act, we shall be forced to acknowledge, that it rather destroyes, and confounds the greatest part of the bodies it opens, and does not leave them in the natural state they were in before, and especially when it is driven with that force which is necessary to draw them. He proves all Alkali Salts, whether Volatile or Fixt to be changed from their Natural state, by the means of Image 8 (unnumbered page) Fire, and also to have received, and to retain the very particles and substance of Fire in its full activity; and shews how the great ebullition which happens upon the mixture of Acid and Alkali is or may be presumed to be wholly or in great part owing to the fire contained in them. The heat, and fume, and ebullition, the noise and detonation, which do attend the making Spirit of Niter Dulcified, do shew what a Fire is drawn into the body of that Corrosive Spirit that can make so remarkable a conflict and bustle, that it is even ready to take flame of it self, though the operation or Dulcification be made without coming near the fire, and though there is no appearance of Alkali contending with Acid, to cause the aforesaid tumult, see the Remarks on Spirit of Niter Dulcified, p. 302, 303. The same thing happens upon mixing Oil of Vitriol, Unnumbered page (another Corrosive Acid) with Oil of Turpentine, which is no Alkali; the mixture grows so hot, through the Fire contained in the Acid, that it sometimes breaks the Viol, and often produces a considerable ebullition, see p. 342. He observes, that water thrown upon Tartar newly Calcined, does heat and cause ebullition, after the manner as it does with Quicklime, the Fire that was entred into it making a violent eruption. He is the first perhaps who has taken such particular notice, what an augmentation of weight is added to many Preparations by the concurrence and incorporation of the substance of Fire into their composition, as you may see in the Calcination of Lead, p. 107. in the Distillation of Spirit of Saturn from the Salt of Saturn, p. 116. in the Calcination of Regulus of Antimony, p. 208. and even Image 9 (unnumbered page) in the Calcination of Antimony by the heat of the Sun with a burning-glass, p. 228. which few instances may possibly lead the way to Inquisitive persons to discover the same augmentation in divers other Preparations. His addiction to Chymistry has not heated his head with fond and groundless hopes of attaining Projection, nor led him to abuse the world with Counterfeiting the Nobler Metals, but he has candidly exposed the impostures of Alchymists at large, in the Chapter of Gold, p. 49, &c. I shall say nothing of his description of the Phosphorus, and divers other new matters delivered in this Edition. I dare presume the Judicious Reader will not dislike many things in the Book, when he has a little considered them. Therefore although we may possibly Unnumbered page be overstockt with Books that pretend to Chymistry, yet I hope the discerning Reader will think it no dis-service, that I become an instrument of adding one more good Book of this kind to the number of our bad ones: the kind reception which the former Edition met with, when comparatively short and imperfect, has already in some measure bespoke the welcom, which this may reasonably hope for, being revised, and very much inlarged by the ingenious Author, and when compared with the former Edition will be found to bear the proportion of a Man in his full strength and vigor, to that of a growing hopeful Youth. I will not detain you from the work it self, only would advise young Students, for whose instruction it is principally designed, not to be too bold in the use of such Medicins as Image 10 (unnumbered page) have undergone great Fires, nor to be over-credulous in believing the strange wonders, and most mighty Cures which too many other Chymists have extravagantly boasted, and most solemnly, but groundlesly assured us. The wise Hippocrates will acquaint them, that  in non-Latin alphabet 	. And Galen frequently teaches, that Nature is abundantly wiser in her works than Art can be; and that the Works of Nature are far above our greatest praises, and deserve our highest admiration, as may be seen more at large in his 7. and 11. Books of that excellent Tract, de usu partium. A good Physician must have studied Art and Nature too. And a Chymist of the first rank will find himself never the worse an Artist, by his being likewise a skilful Naturalist.   Unnumbered page A TABLE OF THE CHAPTERS.  OF Chymistry in general.

THE Word Chymistry is derived from the Greek word  in non-Latin alphabet 	, a Juyce, or from  in non-Latin alphabet 	, to melt; because it teaches us to separate the purer substances of Mixt bodies, which are sometimes called Juices; and because it shews us how to melt things that are of the most solid nature. The Chymists have added the Arabian particle Al, in the word Alchymy, intending to give it a sublime signification, as particularly when the Transmutation of Metals is understood by it, though otherwise Alchymy signifies no more than Chymistry. It is called the Spagirick Art, from  in non-Latin alphabet 	, and  in non-Latin alphabet 	, to separate, and to gather together, because it teaches how to separate the useful parts of a body from the unuseful, and how to joyn them together again. 'Tis called the Hermetick Art, from Image 15 (page 2) Hermes, one of the first Inventors of it. Lastly, it has been called Pyrotechnia, from  in non-Latin alphabet 	, and  in non-Latin alphabet 	, signifying the Art of Fire; for in effect it is by Fire that we bring all Chymical Operations to pass. Other names have been given to this Art, but because the knowledge of them is to no great purpose, we will be contented with having related some of the chief. Chymistry is an Art that teaches how to separate the different substances which are found in Mixt bodies: I mean by a Mixt body those things that naturally grow and increase, such as Minerals, Vegetables, and Animals. Under the name of Minerals, I comprehend the Seven Metals, Minerals, Stones, and Earths; under Vegetables, I understand Plants, Gumms, Rosins, Fruits, the several sorts of Fungus, Seeds, Juyces, Flowers, Mosses, and whatsoever else comes from them. Among these also I reckon Manna, Honey, and those that are called imperfect Mixts. And under Animals I contain both the Animals themselves, and whatsoever belongs to them, as their parts and excrements. But before I begin to speak particularly of all these things, I believe it will be convenient to say something of the Principles of Chymistry, and give a general Idea of Furnaces, Lutes, the degrees of Fire, and Terms that may occasion any obscurity.   Of the Principles of Chymistry. The First Principle that can be admitted for the composition of Mixts, is an �niversal Spirit, which Page 3 being diffused through all the world, produces different things according to the different Matrixes, or Pores of the earth in which it settles. But because this Principle is a little Metaphysical, and falls not under our senses, it will be fit to establish some sensible ones; wherefore I shall relate those that are commonly held. Whereas the Chymists in making the Analysis of Mixt bodies have met with five sorts of Substances, they therefore concluded that there were five Principles of Natural things, Water, Spirit, Oil, Salt, and Earth. Of these five, three of them are Active, the Spirit, Oil, and Salt; and two Passive, Water and Earth. They called them active, by reason they do cause all manner of action; and the others passive, because being in repose themselves, they only serve to stop and hinder the quick motion of the actives. The Spirit which is called Mercury is the first of the Active principles, that appears to us, when we make the Anatomy of a mixt body. 'Tis a subtile, piercing, light substance, that is more in motion than any of the others. It is this which causes all Bodies to grow in more or less time, according as it abounds in them more or less. But it happens that the Bodies wherein it abounds are more liable to corruption, by reason of its too great motion, and this is observ'd in Animals and Vegetables. On the contrary the greatest part of Minerals, as containing but a very small quantity of it, do seem to be incorruptible. It cannot be drawn pure, no more than the others I am going to speak of. But either it is involv'd in a little Oil, that it carries along with it, and then may be Image 16 (page 4) called a Volatile Spirit, such as the Spirit of Wine, of Roses, of Rosemary, of Juniper; or else is detained by some Salts, which check its Volatility, and then may be called a fixt Spirit, as the Acid Spirits of Vitriol, Alum, Salt, &c. The Oil which is called Sulphur by reason of its inflammability, is a sweet, subtile, unctuous substance, that rises after the Spirit. This is said to cause the diversity of Colours and Smells, according to its disposition in Bodies: this gives them their Beauty, and Deformity, uniting together the other Principles: this also sweetens the acrimony of Salts, and by shutting up the Pores of a mixt, hinders it from corrupting, either through too much moisture or cold. Wherefore many Trees and Plants that have a great deal of Oil, are wont to last green much longer than others, and can resist the extremity of ill weathers. It is always drawn impure. For either it is mixt with Spirits, as the Oils of Rosemary, of Lavender, which swim above the water; or else it is fill'd with Salts, that it draws along with it in the distillation, as the Oil of Box, Guaiacum, Cloves, which do precipitate to the bottom of the water by reason of their weight. Salt is the last of the Active Principles, which remains disguised in the Earth, after the other Principles are extracted. It is drawn by pouring water upon the earth to imbibe its Salt; then filtring the dissolution, and evaporating all the moisture, a Salt is found at the bottom of the Vessel. It is a fixt, incombustible substance, that gives Bodies their consistence, and preserves them from corruption. This causes the diversity of tasts, according as it is diversly mixed. Page 5There are three different Salts, as the Fixt, Volatile, and Essential. The Fixt Salt is that which remains after Calcination: the Volatile is that which easily riseth, as the Salt of Animals: And Essential Salt is that which is obtained from the Juyce of Plants by Crystallization. This last is between the Fixt and Volatile. Water, which is called Phlegm, is the first of the Passive Principles: it comes in distillation before the Spirits when they are fixt, or after them when they are volatile. It is never drawn pure, but always receives some impression from the Active Principles. And this causes it to have a more detersive virtue in it than common Water. It serves to separate the Active Principles, and to bridle their motion. The Earth, which is called Caput Mortuum, or Terra Damnata, is the last of the Passive Principles, and can no more be separated pure than the rest, but will still retain some Spirits in it; and if after you have depriv'd it of them as much as you are able, you leave it a good while exposed to the Air, it will recover new Spirits again.  Remarks upon the Principles. The word Principle in Chymistry must not be understood in too nice a sense: for the substances which are so called, are only Principles in respect of us, and as we can advance no farther in the division of bodies; but we well know that they may be still divided into abundance of other parts, which may more justly claim, in propriety of Image 17 (page 6) speech, the name of Principles: wherefore such substances are to be understood by Chymical Principles, as are separated and divided, so far as we are capable of doing it by our weak imperfect powers. And because Chymistry is an Art that demonstrates what it does, it receives for fundamental only such things as are palpable and demonstrable. It is in truth a great advantage to us, that we have Principles so sensible as they are, and whereof we can have so reasonable an assurance. The fond conceits of other Philosophers, concerning Natural Principles, do only puff up the mind with grand Idea's, but they prove or demonstrate nothing. And this is the reason that going to discover their Principles, we find some of them do frame one Systeme, and others another. But if we would come as near as may be to the true Principles of Nature, we cannot take a more certain course than that of Chymistry, which will serve us as a Ladder to them; and this division of substances, though it may seem a little gross, will give us a very great Idea of Nature, and the figure of the first small particles which have entred into the composition of mixt bodies. Some modern Philosophers would perswade us, that it is altogether uncertain, whether the substances which are separated from bodies, and are called Chymical Principles, do effectually exist and are naturally residing in the body before: these do tell us that the fire by rarifying the matter in time of distillation is capable of bestowing upon it such an alteration as is quite different from what it had before, and so of forming the Salt, Oil, and other things which are drawn from it. Page 7This objection does at first seem to have much weight and reason in it, because it is certain (as hereafter shall be shewn) that the Fire does give a very considerable impression to the preparations, and that very often it does put such a new face upon things, that they are very hardly to be known when compar'd with what they were before. But it is easie to shew, that though the Fire does so diversifie and alter substances, yet it does not make those Principles; for we see them and smell them in many bodies, before ever we bring them to undergo the Fire. For example, it cannot be denied, but that there was existent Oyl in Olives, in Almonds, in Nuts, and in many other fruits and seeds, because it is drawn, only by beating and pressing them. Turpentine, which is a thickned Oyl, and many other fat, or unctuous liquors, are drawn by meer incision into the trunk, or root of trees; and what else I pray is the fat of animals but an Oyl, or Sulphur coagulated? Nor can it be denied, but that there is salt actually in mixt bodies, since that by bruising a Plant, and making expression to draw out its juyce, and then leaving the juyce to settle in some cool place for a few daies, a salt will be found fixt about the vessel in form of little Crystals. I know that some doubting Scepticks (who make it their business to doubt of every thing) will still say that by beating the Almonds, and then pressing them, and by making incision into Trees, the parts which compose the plant are agitated and put in motion after such a manner as they are by Fire, and that this agitation of parts is capable of ranging them so, as to make the Oyl and Salt. Image 18 (page 8) But such reasonings as these do destroy themselves by too much niceness, and there is no sober understanding man but easily perceives the falshood; for can a man well perceive that meer trituration or incision are able to make Salt, Oyl, Earth? it is abundantly more probable, nay, and it may be sufficiently demonstrated, that those substances did exist in the bodies before, and that by incision and trituration the gate has only been opened to let them come freely out. Others again do attack the Principles of Chymistry after another manner a little differing from this, these do acknowledge that the foresaid substances are naturally in the Mixts, much as we draw them by Art, but they assert that we have no proof that the Mixts are compounded of these same substances, called Principles, and that they are not drawn from the juyce of the earth in such a form; that Salt, Sulphur, &c. may indeed have been formed in the natural Fermentations, and other elaborations, which happen in the Mixt during its growth, and therefore they conclude that those substances cannot properly be called Principles, because we do not know sufficiently whether the Mixt was composed of them at first. But since we are satisfied that the earths which serve for a matrix to Mixt bodies, are impregnated with Salt, Sulphur, and other substances of the nature of those which we do find in the bodies, and since we can perceive nothing else which can contribute to their composition, it remains beyond all doubt that they are even compounded of them. It must be granted that the Fermentations, or other Elaborations which come to pass in mixt Page 9 bodies, have given the Principles a certain order of parts, or some dispositions they had not before, but they do by no means form, or compose them. The five Principles are easily found in Animals and Vegetables, but not so easily in Minerals. Nay there are some Minerals, out of which you cannot possibly draw so much as two, nor make any separation at all (as Gold and Silver) whatsoever they talk, who search with so much pains for the Salts, Sulphurs and Mercuries of these metals. I can believe, that all the Principles do indeed enter into the composition of these Bodies, but it does not follow that they must remain in their former condition, or can be drawn as they were before; for it may be these substances which are called Principles are so strictly involved one within another, as to suffer no separation any other way than by breaking their Figure. Now it is by reason of their Figure that they are called Salts, Sulphurs, and Spirits: For example, if you mix an Acid Spirit with the Salt of Tartar or some other Alkali, the edges of the Acid will so insinuate into the pores of the Salt, that if by distillation you would separate the Acid Spirit again from the Salt, you'l never be able to effect it, the Acid will have lost almost all its strength, because the edges of these Spirits are so far destroyed or changed, that they no longer preserve their former Figure. Every body knows that glass is made of Salt, but because the Fire hath wrought so great a change upon its Texture, or Figure, it can do nothing at all that Salt is used to do; nay, and it is in a manner impossible to draw any true Salt from it by Chymistry. Image 19 (page 10)There are three sorts of Liquors that are qualified with the name of Spirit in Chymistry; the Spirit of Animals, the Burning spirit of Vegetables, and the Acid spirit. The first of them, as the spirit of Harts-horn, is nothing but a Volatile salt dissolved by a little Phlegm, as I shall shew when I treat of Animals. The second, as the Spirit of Wine, the Spirit of Juniper, and the Spirit of Rosemary, is an exalted Oyl, as I shall shew speaking of Wines. And the last, as the Spirit of Vinegar, Tartar, and Vitriol, is an Acid Essential salt, dissolved and put in fusion by the fire, as I shall prove, when I speak of Vinegar, and the distillation of Tartar: this last is called a Fluid salt. These three sorts of liquors comprehending all that can any way be called Spirit, this may pass for one Principle very well; for seeing that the Spirit which is drawn from Animals is nothing but a Salt dissolved by a little Phlegm; that Spirit of Wine is only an Oyl exalted, and that the Acid Spirit is a Salt become fluid, we can observe nothing in these liquors but an Oyl, Salts of a different nature, and water. Wherefore it must be concluded, that the Spirit or Mercury which Chymists have talk'd of is a meer Chimaera, that serves only to confound mens minds, and render Chymistry unintelligible; for men might if they would, have called these liquors by more proper names: thus what hindred them from calling the Spirit of Animals, by the name of a Volatile salt dissolv'd? the liquors which come from Oyls might have been called an exalted Oyl; and the Acid spirits a Fluid salt; and hereby we should not Page 11 have been troubled about an imaginary Principle, and Chymistry would have been better understood. But it is impossible to change a name that has been so long fixt and appropriated to these liquors. All that I can do is to explicate, as I have done, what is meant by the word Spirit, in order to avoid Equivocations. Nothing but the Oyl, can properly be said to be Inflammable, and the Oyl is so much the more so, as the Salts, with which it is closely united, have been more or less spiritualized. For that which I call Spirit in the Oyl, is nothing but an Essential or Volatile Salt; this Salt is not of it self Inflammable, but serves to Rarifie and Exalt the parts of the Oyl to render them the more susceptible of Motion, and consequently of Flagration; after the same manner as when Salt-peter is put to mix with some Oily substance, this Oily matter fires much more easily than when it is alone; though Salt-peter of it self is not at all Inflammable, as I shall prove hereafter. We have examples of the truth of what I say in Spirit of Wine, Oyl of Turpentine, and all other Inflammable Liquors; for they are only Oyls subtilized and refined by the Volatile Salts they contain. Vegetables have a great deal of Salt much like to Salt-peter; this Salt being straitly united with their Oyl makes them the more apt to flame, than if they had been deprived of it. The Fat of Animals as well as their other parts, is full of a Volatile Acid salt; Wax, Rosine, and all other matters that are inflammable, are impregnated with an Acid Salt, Essential or Volatile. Image 20 (page 12)I say the Salt which causes the flagration of Oyls, must be either Volatile or Essential, for if it were a fixt Salt, 'twould have a contrary effect, it would allay in some measure the quick motion of the parts of an Inflammable body; and this we see happens when Sea-salt is flung into the fire, it serves to put it out. Common Sulphur yields us another instance of the same kind: consisting of one part Sulphureous or Oily, and another Saline or Acid fixt, which plainly appears in the opening of it, the Oily part fires, and would soon rise like other Oils into a great white flame, but that the Acid part being a load to its activity hinders it from rising, and so forces it to cast but only a small blue flame; and a proof of what I affirm may be had from mixing Salt-peter with Sulphur; for the Volatile salt of Salt-peter does Volatilize the Salts of Sulphur, and causes a white flame to burn violently, as I shall shew hereafter in the Operation of Salt Polychrest. Many things are called Oils very improperly, as the Oyl of Tartar made per Deliquium, the Oyl of Vitriol, and the Oyl of Antimony. The first is nothing else but a Salt dissolved, the second is the strongest, and most caustick part of the spirit of Vitriol, and the last is a mixture of Acid Spirit, and Antimony. As for Salt, I am apt to think, that there is one chief, of which all the rest are compounded, and do conceive it to be made of an Acid liquor sliding through the veins of the Earth, which doth insensibly insinuate and incorporate in the Pores of stones, which it does dilate and attenuate: afterwards by a long fermentation and concoction of Page 13 several years, a Salt comes to be formed, that is called Fossile; and this Opinion is the more likely to be true, because from the mixture of Acids with some Alkali matter we always draw a substance very like unto Salt. Now stones are an Alkali. I add, that the long fermentation, and concoction which is made in the stone, serves to digest, and perfectly unite the Acid with the stony parts, for the making of Salt. This Fossile salt, which is called Gemma, by reason of its transparency, is found in many high Mountains of Europe, such as those in Poland, Catalonia, and Persia, and in the Indies; it is altogether like that we use for nourishment, which is called Sea salt, insomuch that the Waters of the Sea may be said to receive their saltishness from nothing else but this Salt dissolved in them. Is it not likely enough that the bottom of the Sea, or its shores, may be much like the surface of the Earth we inhabit, and that there may be Mountains, Rocks, different sorts of earth, and consequently inexhaustible Mountains of Salt in a Million of places at the bottom of the Sea, whence it receives its brackishness? And it may be there are Waters, which after taking Salt from several earths, do at last discharge themselves into the Sea through an infinite number of subterranean channels, which do much contribute likewise to making Sea-water salt. That which confirms me in this opinion is, because there are Lakes in Italy, Germany, Egypt, the Indies, and many other places, which are as Salt as the Sea, and can have no other cause but that their waters have hapned to run through Mines of Salt. Image 21 (page 14)I doubt not but many will be apt to object against my opinion, that the Sea being of so prodigious boundless an extent, all the Salt I have spoken of, would not be able to salt it as it is; but if they please to consider, that this great extent of the Ocean may meet with Mines of Salt in abundance of places, and that what is once dissolv'd can never be separated from it, I am perswaded their doubt will soon vanish. Add to what is said, that Sea water does not contain so great a quantity of Salt as is commonly imagined: and this is easily prov'd, if you take the pains to evaporate some of it over the fire, or dissolve salt in that water; for it will receive a considerable quantity into it, which is a certain sign, that the water was not so salt before, as it might have been, for if it had been impregnated with as much as it could, it would have dissolv'd no more. Therefore we have good reason to believe, that the Sea, which may be called a large Lake, becomes salt through the Mines that are therein, and the Salt Currents that in several places empty into it. Some Fountains are also seen to yield a Salt like this; because their waters having passed through places fill'd with this Salt, have dissolved and carried along with them some of it. Salt-peter differs from these salts I speak of, in that it contains more spirit; so that when you take the pains to exalt a part of it, what remains is like unto Sal Gemme. It may be objected that Salt peter is found in places where no Acid liquor can be thought to come; but no body can doubt but that there is an Acid in the Air, which though a very insensible Page 15 body, is able enough to enter into Stones and Earths, the truth whereof is seen every day in Earths that have lost their Salt as much as could be drawn by Art, which upon being exposed some time to the open air get new additions of Salt, and encrease their weight considerably. Now the liquor that I speak of, which runs in some places of the earth, receives its Acidity from this Acid Spirit of the Air, which condenses in some places better than in others, by reason of the coolness, or some other disposition it finds there. I conceive therefore that Salt peter is form'd in Stones and Earths by the Acid spirit of the Air, after the same manner as Sal Gemme in Mines by an Acid liquor, and that this Aerial acid entring insensibly into the body of stones produces a Salt at first much like Sal Gemme; but afterwards new Acid spirits still coming and mixing with it makes it of a middle nature between Volatile and fixt. And it is for this reason that a great deal of Salt peter is taken from old ruined buildings, for the stones there continuing a long time exposed to the air, receive greater quantity of spirits than other stones; it is likewise to be found in Cellers and other places where the Sun casts no heat, because the spirit of the air does there easily condense by reason of the coolness and moisture. But I shall discourse more amply of that, when I come to treat of the Preparations that are made upon Salt peter. Vitriols, Alums, and all other Salts, that are naturally found in the Earth, may be explicated upon the same Principle; for according as Acid liquors do meet with different earths, they produce different Salts. Image 22 (page 16)All Earths being impregnated with an Acid Salt, as I have said, it is not hard to conceive how that the salt of Vegetables is communicated to them from the earth wherein they grew. Their growth must needs have proceeded from a Saline juice of the earth they grew in, which having opened the Seed through the Fermentation it caused, insinuates and filtrates into the Fibres that constitute the Plant; and the leaving grounds fallow some years, is in order to preserve and retain the Salt that is continually encreased in them by the Acid spirit of the air. Likewise Dung, and other matters, which are said to fatten and fructifie Lands, do so by nothing else but their Salt. Neither need we wonder at the barrenness of sandy and stony soils, for that the Acid spirit of the Air cannot unite and fix with them in sufficient quantity to render them fertile. Nevertheless it is worth observation, that there are Lands which remain barren, through too great an abundance of Salt they contain, and for this reason in Egypt they are forced to temper their grounds with Sand after the ebbing of the River Nile, to make them Fertile; because the earth, till that is done, is so full of Salt, that its Pores are quite choaked up with it. So that instead of causing any Fermentation in the Seed, the Salt fixes and depresses it, so that it can't have its motion free enough to rarifie, and raise a stalk; but now when Sand is mingled with it, it is able to divide and separate the Salt, which not having then such power of fixing the Seed, it Ferments and rises into a Plant. Whence it may be seen, that too much Salt is at least as Offensive to the earths fertility, as too little, and that it is the same Page 17 thing with other Fermentable matters as it is with Earths, they come to ferment by means of a moderate quantity of Salt mixed with them; for if you add too much, the Fermentation will be spoil'd. Again, every kind of Salt is not fit to fertilize lands, it must be a Volatile Salt, or approaching to the nature of Salt-peter, to serve for Vegetation; a Salt too fixt would rather spoil it, and it has been observ'd that places which should fructifie, have brought forth nothing, when Sea-salt has been sprinkled upon them; the reason of which is for that this fixt Salt hinders the Fermentation that was necessary to fertilize. Nevertheless it sometimes happens, that the Ashes of Vegetables, though full of a fixt salt, do serve to fertilize; and this Countrey-men are well acquainted with, who in some places where they find their Lands too poor and barren to yield any thing without assistance of Art, do use at certain seasons of the year to burn Fern and Turfs upon them, and spread about the ashes. Now it is by reason of a Lixivious salt in the ashes, that the Lands are hereby improv'd. But this happens for the same reason as I said before, for the fixt Salt of Vegetables that lies in the ashes is very porous, as I shall prove hereafter; and so does very well mix with the Spirits or acid Salts of the Air, and turns easily into Salt-peter, as when Spirit of Salt-peter is mixt with an Alkali salt, it makes a good Salt-peter. As for sea-salt, possibly it might happen, that if it were left in the Earth for some considerable time, it would impregnate with the Spirit of the Air, and so being at length Volatilized would Image 23 (page 18) render a place fertile. But because it is a very compact body, and its parts closely united, the Volatilizing of it would be a tedious business, and so the present requisite Fermentation failing, the place would remain barren too long to gratifie our expectations. It is very likely that the Volatile or Nitrous salt meets in the Earth with some Sulphureous or fat matter, that is continually raised by the subterranean heat toward the surface of the Earth, and unites with it. This mixture of a Volatile salt and Sulphur together may much contribute towards explicating the manner of Vegetation; for just as the mixture of Sulphur and Salt-peter does excellently dispose to an Exaltation by heat, which will not happen while they are separated; so the Bituminous or fat part of the earth mixing with Salt-peter, which all Earths have, the subterranean heat exalts them much more easily, than if the Salt were alone. And now let us see what happens from this Exaltation to the production of Plants. Some part of this Sulphureous salt, meeting with seed in the earth proper to grow, does enter into the seed, and cause a Fermentation, that is to say, suppling the parts of the seed, disposes it to open it self. Now 'tis very certain, (and what has been sensibly demonstrated by Microscopes) that each grain of seed contains in little the whole Plant with all its parts. Wherefore this opening the body of the seed is by reason that the sulphureous salts entring at the pores of the root of this small Plant, and by their Volatile quality insinuating along the Fibres which constitute the Plant, do orderly display before us what was before but very confused in respect of us. Page 19These salts do never enter at the head of the Plant, and so descend to the Root, though often the Root of the Seed lies uppermost, and the head or stalk downwards, because the Pores of the stalk are not of such a Figure as is proper to receive them, whereas those of the Root have a proper contexture. The Volatility of these Salts does also cause the stalk, though seated downwards, to rise upwards, and follow their tendency, which is always up; and this is that which by extending and enlarging the Fibres of the Plant, makes it grow to that height which their nature requires. 'Tis probable that this fat part of earth insinuating with the salt, as I have said, does make the Oyl of a mixt body; for we find that those matters which help best to fertilize, are full of Volatile Salt and Oyl, as Dung, �rine, and Plants corrupted. 'Tis fit to observe here, that the salt does act after another-guise manner than the Oyl in hindring the Fermentation or corruption of the matter it is mixed with; for it does not only stop the pores, and hinder the air from entring, but fixes it likewise by its hooked parts, that it can neither have motion nor rarefaction, for which reason it is that meat is salted in order to keep it sweet, and does thereby remain firm and compact for some time. Three kinds of salt are drawn from Vegetables, an Acid salt called Essential, a Volatile, and a Fixt salt. The first is sometimes like Salt-peter, and sometimes like Tartar, according as it contains more or less earth; this salt is drawn from the juice of the Plant, as I said before; for after expression Image 24 (page 20) and purifying this juice, it is set in a vessel in some cool place a few daies without stirring, and the salt shoots into Crystals every way. This Acid salt may be said to be the true salt that was in the Plant, because the means that are used in drawing it are Natural, and such as cannot change its nature; but this can't be said of those others, because the violent fires that are used about them make impressions of another nature, and their effects are very different, so that the fire seems to alter and disguise them, as I shall shew in the following discourse. The second salt, or the Volatile salt of Plants is usually drawn from seeds or fruits Fermented. While it remains in the Vegetable, it differs from the Essential salt only in this, that being driven up higher by Spirits, it becomes more Volatile. The Fermentation that is caused in fruits by beating and bruising them, does very much assist us in Volatilizing the salt; for it sets the particles at work, and disposes them for an easier separation; but it happens that in the great circulation, or continual motion this salt is in, it unites so strongly with the Oyl, which Fruits and Seeds are full of, that they can't be separated by Crystallizing the juice, as they can in drawing them from other parts of the Plant. We must therefore have recourse to the help of fire. The fruit or seed which contains the Volatile salt, as I shall prove in its proper place, is Distilled by a Retort, and Water comes forth in the first place, then an Oyl, and lastly a most keen ill scented salt (that easily flies away) upon encreasing the fire to purpose, is driven into the Receiver. Now it is plain that fire has Page 21 chang'd, or else added something to this salt; for when it was in the Plant, it had no manner of smell like that it gets by distillation. But to shew there's a strange alteration in this salt, as soon as it is mixed with an Acid, there presently appears an Ebullition, or Effervescency, which remains until the Acid has throughly entred into the salt. Which circumstance does not happen to it in its Natural state, it is this Ebullition that gave it the name of a Volatile Alkali, to distinguish it from a Fixt Alkali, of which I shall speak hereafter. The Chymists will needs have this Volatile Alkali to be in the Plant, just the same as when it is drawn; that is to say, they make this a different species of salt, lying hid under the acid, until it is laid open by the force of fire. But this opinion is founded on no credible experience, for Anatomize the Plant how you think fit, without using fire, and you shall never find any other but an acid salt. Doubtless it will be said, that all other ways of dissecting Plants even into their salts, prove too weak without the assistance of this grand dissolvent fire. But if we consider impartially how fire does act, we shall be forced to acknowledge that it rather destroys, and confounds the greatest part of the bodies it opens, and does not leave them in the natural state they were in before, and especially when it is driven with that force which is necessary to draw this salt. So that I see no reason why the species of things should be multiplied without necessity, by admitting many kinds of salts in Plants, and I conceive with much more probability, that the Volatile Alkali salt is a part of the Acid Essential salt I spoke of, which having been first disposed to a Volatile nature, Image 25 (page 22) and afterwards driven by the force of fire, draws along with it a portion of Empyreumatical Oil, that gives it such a disagreeable smell, and some terrestrious calcined matter, with which it is so strongly united, and which changes its nature, by breaking the Saline points, and rendring them Porous, so that any acid liquor being cast upon it, enters into the Pores, and violently divides the parts, whence follows the Effervescency. Perchance likewise this Calx or Calcined earth may have retained igneous particles, and so the edges of the acid beginning to open the pores of salt, these little igneous bodies being in a violent motion do strike about, and break open all their small prisons, and from thence it may be, the violent Ebullition happens. Such as are prejudiced with the Sentiments of ancient Chymists, will rellish very hardly this new Opinion of mine; but I am perswaded if any one will take the pains to examine the matter near at hand, and make some Experiments on the salts of Plants, he will find my Discourse come near enough to truth. The last salt or the fixt salt of Plants remains mixed with the earthy part after Distillation of the other substances; the matter is taken out of the Retort, and calcined in an open fire, for to free it from the soot that blackens it; afterwards the salt is drawn by a Lixivium as I have shewn before. This salt is called fixt, in comparison with others, because this cannot sublime. It is observable, that because a great quantity of this kind of salt is drawn from a plant called Kali, the name Alkali has been given to the fixt salt of all plants; and that because an effervescency Page 23 does rise upon mixing an acid liquor with this Salt, all Volatile or fixt salts, and all terrestrious matters which ferment with acids, have come to be called Alkali's. The Chymists do assure us, but with little foundation for it, that in Terrestrious bodies, in Metalls, Coral, Pearl, and generally in all bodies that Ferment with acids, there is an hidden Alkali in them, which is one of the Principles of Fermentation, wherefore they give them the names of Alkali's; but because no manner of Salt can be drawn from them, to prove their Opinion, and they have no other rational Argument to perswade me, they must give me leave to think otherwise than they have done, and I conceive that the contrary to what they have established will serve me better to explicate the truth. Following therefore the Principle I have laid, I believe that those Terrestrious bodies are themselves Alkali's, rather than that the Ebullition of Acid and Alkali proceeds from a salt supposed to be contained in them; and further that the salts are never Alkali's until they have undergone the force of fire, and been reduced into a Calx. I have proved, speaking of the nature of Volatile salt, that the fire did very much change the substances of things; and as I have shewn there is good reason to think there is but only one species of salt in Plants, and the Volatile salt is but a change wrought by fire; I shall proceed upon the same Principle, and affirm that there is no fixt Alkali salt in Plants, but that by Calcination the fire has fixt a part of the acid Essential salt with the earthy part that has serv'd to break the keenest Image 26 (page 24) of its points, and rendred them Porous, like a Calx. It is by reason of these Pores that this kind of salt grows humid, and melts so easily when exposed to the Air; and the Terrestrious parts do turn it into an Alkali, for if they were not mixed with it, it would continue still an acid salt, and opposed to Alkali. But to clear up this point the better, we must consider as nicely as may be the nature of an Acid and an Alkali. Whereas the nature of a thing so obscure as that of salt, cannot better be explicated, than by admitting to its parts such figures as are answerable to the effects it produces; I shall affirm, that the acidity of any liquor does consist in keen particles of salts, put in motion; and I hope no body will offer to dispute whether an acid has points or no, seeing every ones experience does demonstrate it, they need but taste an acid to be satisfied of it, for it pricks the tongue like any thing keen, and finely cut; but a demonstrative and convincing proof that an acid does consist of pointed parts is, that not only all acid salts do Crystallize into edges, but all Dissolutions of different things, caused by acid liquours, do assume this figure in their Crystallization; these Crystalls consist of points differing both in length and bigness one from another, and this diversity must be attributed to the keener or blunter edges of the different sorts of acids; and so likewise this difference of the points in subtilty is the cause that one acid can penetrate and dissolve well one sort of mixt, that another can't rarifie at all: thus Vinegar dissolves Lead, which aqua fortis can't: Aqua fortis dissolves Quick-silver, which Vinegar will not touch: Aqua Page 25 Regalis dissolves Gold, whenas Aqua fortis cannot meddle with it; on the contrary Aqua fortis dissolves Silver, but can do nothing with Gold, and so of the rest. As for Alkali's, they are soon known by pouring an acid upon them, for presently or soon after, there rises a violent Ebullition, which remains until the acid finds no more bodies to rarifie. This effect may make us reasonably conjecture that an Alkali is a terrestrious and solid matter, whose pores are figured after such a manner that the acid points entring into them do strike and divide whatsoever opposes their motion; and according as the parts of which the Alkali is compounded, are more or less solid, the acids finding more or less resistance, do cause a stronger or weaker Ebullition. So we see the Effervescency that happens in the dissolution of Coral is very much milder than that in the dissolution of Silver. There are as many different Alkali's, as there are bodies that have different pores, and this is the reason why an acid will Ferment with one strongly, and with another not at all; for there must be a due proportion between the acid points, and the pores of the Alkali. The nature of Alkali's being thus established, there will be no need of flying to an imaginary salt in Plants for explication of the Effervescency; and 'twill be easily conceived that if an Alkali salt is full of a terrestrious matter that renders it porous like other Alkali's, it must cause an Ebullition. That which I said, speaking of Volatile salts, may here be added, that the Igneous particles breaking in through the Pores of the Alkali salt, wherein Image 27 (page 26) they became imprisoned by the Calcination, do much contribute to the raising this Effervescency. And really when the Acid Spirit of Vitriol, or Aqua fortis is cast upon an Alkali salt, there happens as strong an Ebullition, as when this liquor is flung into the fire it self. Acid Salts do rarely cause any effervescency with Acid liquors, because their pores being very small, the common acids are not able to pierce into them; but we do sometimes meet with Acids whose points are so fine and so proportioned to the pores of the Salts, that they will find an entrance even into the exceeding little pores of these Acid Salts, and thereby cause a commotion. And then these Salts, although they be Acid, yet may be called Alkali's in respect of such keen Acids. This does happen to Sea-salt, which is an Acid, for though it will make no Ebullition, neither with Spirit of salt, nor with Spirit of Niter, nor with Spirit of Alom, nor with Spirit of Vitriol; yet if you mix it with the strongest Oil of Vitriol, there will rise an Effervescency. Wherefore it may be said that one Acid Salt is an Alkali in respect of another, because there being few bodies without some pores, few of them will prove to be impenetrable, when they meet with Acids of an extraordinary subtlety. The Fermentation that happens to Dow, to new Wine, and such like things, differs from that I now spoke of, in that it is more gentle, and slow; this is caused by the Natural Acid salt contained in them, which expanding and exalting it self by its motion, does rarifie and raise up the grosser and sulphureous part which endeavours to allay its Page 27 motion, from whence it comes that the matter swells up. The reason why an Acid does not make Sulphureous things Ferment, with so much noise and suddenness as Alkali's, is, because that Oyls consist of pliant parts that yield and make no resistance to the points of Acids, as a piece of Wool or Cotton will yield and give way to needles that are thrust into it. Thus methinks two sorts of Fermentations may be admitted of, the one of an Acid with an Alkali, which may be called Ebullition, and the other, when an Acid does by little and little rarifie some softish matter, as Dow, or clear and Sulphureous, as Muste, Syder, and all other juices of Plants. This last sort may rather be called Fermentation. It is further remarkable that the Acid and Alkali do so destroy one another in their conflict, that when as much Acid has been by degrees poured as is necessary to penetrate the Alkali in all its parts, it is then no more an Alkali, nor can it be so again, though you wash it to carry off the Acid, because it has no longer that disposition of Pores which is requisite in an Alkali; and the Acid breaks and loses its points in the contest, especially when the Alkali is pretty compact and solid; so that if you would recover your Acid again, you'l find it has in a manner lost all its acidity, and retains only a sharpness. But the Sulphur or Oyl consisting of supple yielding parts does only receive some Acid impression, and no such close union, so that it can be drawn from Sulphureous bodies much the same as when it was mixt. Image 28 (page 28)Animals do yield us two sorts of Salt, the one Volatile, and the other Fixt; of the first sort they yield greater quantity than of the second, because they do abound much in Spirits, which by their continual circulation do Volatilize it. This Salt differs but little from the Volatile salt of Seeds and Fruits, both which are drawn in a Retort; they have the same kind of smell, taste, and other virtues. The Volatile salt of Animals keeps dry a longer time than the others, because it carries away with it more fixt salt than those others. As for fixt salt, animals do yield but a very little of it, and in some animals you shall find none at all; it is drawn as the fixt salt of Plants; they are both Alkali's. There is no salt that can be called alkali, to be found in the parts, or humors of Animals, until they have passed the fire; a Saline serosity may be observed in them, but that salt is acid; and it proceeds doubtless from the Aliments that are taken for nourishment. Now as I have shewn that there is only an acid salt in Earths and Vegetables, so I may say the same of Animals, and the rather because no other kind of Salt can be found in them in their Natural state; the alkali salts that are drawn from them, are only several mutations of an acid salt, made by fire, which mingles with them earthy particles after the manner I have spoken of treating of the Alkali's of Plants. But it is observable, that whereas there is a greater proportion of Spirits in Animals than Seeds, these Spirits do serve to exalt all the Salt; which is the reason that less fixt salt is to be found in Animals than Plants. Page 29As for what many do say that Choler causes an Effervescency like an Alkali, when an acid is cast upon it, 'tis a mistake through want of right Observation, for no Ebullition at all happens for some time. Nevertheless I will not say, that an acid produces no Fermentation in Choler, Bloud, and other parts of the body, for it does very often really do that; but that is no more than uses to be done in new Wine, Beer, and other liquors of the like nature. I have already explicated this sort of Fermentation. We ought not to omit speaking of the Coagulation that's made in Milk after a Fermentation caused either by Heat, or some Acid put into it. Methinks here is no need at all of supposing an Alkali salt, that ferments with the Acid of this liquor, as many suppose for explicating this Effect, since if we consider but the natural composition of Milk, we shall find it to be nothing but a Creamy substance swimming on the Serum, and mixed only superficially with it, by the intermixture of some salt; so that it is in a fitting state of separation, as soon as the salt gains a little more motion than it had, whether it be by Fermentation, or by encreasing its activity by an acid of its own nature. Thus when the heat of the Summer, or fire has stirred up the acid that is in the Milk, or else some acid is poured into it, the edges of the acid do cut and divide the Creamy part, to gain a free motion in the Serum, and separate into Curd all the Butter and Cheese. Now there's nothing strange in the Precipitation of the Curd, especially when an acid has been poured upon the Milk, for besides the weight it gains by thickning, some part Image 29 (page 30) of the acids do mix with it, and encrease its weight; for according as the acid that was mingled is stronger or weaker, the Curd does Precipitate more or less. Perhaps some will say, for as much as acid is always the cause of Coagulation in Milk, there's no great likelihood that a salt of the same nature should be the instrument of uniting the several parts of Milk. But it must be considered, that although there is an acid in Milk (as no body can doubt, seeing it sowres of it self, when stale) this acid is as it were imbodied in the ramous parts of the Oyl, so that there is loses all its motion and cannot come to action but by rarifying the Oyl, and making it fit to mix with the serous part; it is the due proportion of this salt, Oyl, and serum, that makes the Butter and Cheesy part of Milk. Now I hope I have said enough to establish what I have affirmed, that there's no salt in nature besides the acid, out of which all other Salts are made, and that the Alkali salt has no Natural existence in mixt bodies. My discourse will be the better relished when I speak of the Operations of Chymistry, and you'l find that by this Principle, which I may call the most Natural and impartial of all that have been laid till now, I shall be able to give account of many Phaenomena's that have never been explicated by common Principles.    Page 31 Of Chymical Furnaces and Vessels. It is not my design to relate here exactly all the kinds of Vessels and Furnaces that Artists have invented to use in Chymistry. I shall describe only those with which you will be able to perform all Operations, and send curious persons, who would be more particularly instructed in them, into the Laboratories, where they may learn more on this subject than ever they will be able to do by consulting all the Books in the world. These then are the principal. The Furnace which is most in use among Chymists is that which is called the Reverberatory; it must be large enough to hold a great Retort, for the Distillation of acid Spirits, and other things. This Furnace must be fixt, and made of Brick, joyned together with a Lute compounded of one part of Potters earth, so much Horse-dung, and twice as much Sand, the whole kneaded together in Water; let it be two Bricks breadth, that the Furnace being the thicker, the heat may be retained the longer: let the Ash-hole be a Foot high, and the Door contrived, if possible, on the side that the air comes, that when you have a mind to open it, the Fire may be lighted or encreased the more easily; the fire room need not be quite so high; you must lay a-cross it two Iron-bars of the bigness of your thumb, which will serve you to set your Retort upon; and the Furnace must be still raised near about a Foot higher, to cover the Retort; fit to it a Dome, or Cover, Image 30 (page 32) that may have a hole in the middle with its stopple, and a small Chimny a foot high, for to place upon this hole, when the stopple is taken out, and when you would raise a great heat; for the flame preserving its self by means of this little Chimney, it reverberates the more strongly upon the Retort. This Cover may be made of the same Paste, that I shall presently describe, speaking of Portable Furnaces. It will be necessary to have several Furnaces of this same fashion; but they must be of different sizes, to work conveniently according to the bigness of the Vessel you would place in it. For that the Fire may act more vehemently upon the Retort, there must be left but only the space of a fingers breadth all round between the Furnace and the Retort. These Furnaces may also serve for Distilling by the Refrigeratory, in the Sea-Bath, the Vaporous and the Sand-bath; for you may place the Copper body upon the Iron bars, when you would distil by the Refrigeratory. It is easie to do the same with the Balneum Mariae. As for the Sand-bath, lay an iron or earthen pan on the bars, and put sand enough into it for to cover the bottom and sides of the Vessel you desire to heat. As for Fusions, you must build a Furnace of the same matter and form as those spoken of before; only you must forbear laying the two Iron bars in it, that you did in the others, for support of the Vessel. Moveable Furnaces are made of a paste that consists of three parts of broken pots in powder, and two parts of clay temper'd together with Water. Their structure is just like that of the   Unnumbered page  Image 31 (unnumbered page) An Explication of the FIGURES of the FIRST TABLE.

Unnumbered page  The THIRD TABLE.    Image 34 (unnumbered page) Page 33 Reverberatory Furnace. You may also leave holes through which the Iron-bars may pass, which support the Retort that they may be easily taken out, when you have a mind to use this Furnace for Fusions. A Furnace of this form may be called Polychrest (or general) because such a one may be used for all sorts of Operations. It is likewise convenient for Fusions, to have a moveable Furnace of the same matter as the others; it must be round, and may be set upon a stool: it is to have only one grate, and six Registers, or holes on the sides, to let in the air to the fire. The Dome may be made of the same matter, for to cover it, and a small earthen Chimney for to place upon the hole of the Dome, that the fire may keep the stronger. See the figure of it in the second Table. You must be sure to put sand, or broken pots, or such like things into the Paste that you use for the building Furnaces, either fixt, or moveable, to hinder them from cracks, when they come to dry; for these matters rendring the clay more porous, the wet breaths out much the more easily. Again, Lime and Sand tempered together, might serve for the building your fixt Furnaces, and stones might be used instead of bricks; but because it is necessary to increase and lessen the Furnaces, to proportion their size to the vessels you would place in them, the description which I gave before is the more convenient, for that a man may very easily break them, and build them again, without the help of a Brick-layer. Image 35 (page 34)A small Iron Furnace with its iron pot, and a cover to it, is convenient for performing many operations; this pot may serve for a Balneum Mariae, and for a Vaporous Bath, when there is no other. It may be likewise used to distil by an Alembick, in a Bath of Sand, Ashes, or of filings of Iron. See the description of it in the first Table. A great Iron Furnace should likewise be had, whereon to place a Copper Balneum Mariae, for to distil with four bodies at once. In the middle of this Bath there should be a pipe raised, the top of which must be made like a Funnel, into which you are to pour hot water, in place of that which consumes away in vapour. See its figure in the third Table. As for Vessels chuse them as much as may be of Earth or Glass; for it is to be feared that those which are made of Metal will communicate some particular impression to the Liquors you put into them: but because sometimes you may have occasion to distil a great many things in a little time, you may use the Copper-Cucurbit, or Body Tinn'd, because that Tinn is not so soluble as Copper, and besides hath no such pernicious quality: upon this Cucurbit place a fit head, round about which must be made a kind of bason to hold the water that cools and condenses the vapours which rise from the Matter contained in the Vesica so soon as it is heated. See its description in the second Table. You may likewise provide a Copper pipe tinn'd o'th' inside, which may pass sloping downwards through a vessel fill'd with water; and when you would distil Essences with it, you must fit the upper Page 35 end of it to the nose of the head, and the lower end of it to the mouth of the Receiver; but you must remember to empty the water out of the vessel, according as it grows hot, for to cool the liquor that is distilling; and to this end there must be a hole made at the bottom of the vessel, to be stopt with a wooden stopple, which may be taken out, and put in again, as often as you would let out the water. The Moor's head is a Copper cap tinn'd on the inside, made like to a head. See the figure of it in the first Table. Many Retorts of different sizes are necessary in a Laboratory; those which are of Earth are convenient for the distillation of Acid Spirits, because they are able to endure the utmost degree of Fire, and will not melt as glass do. The Vessels made of Earth have their pores as close as glass it self, and preserve the Spirits as well. They who want Earthen Vessels may coat their glass Retorts with the Lute that I shall describe hereafter, that if the glass should melt, when they are distilling Acid Spirits, the Lute may preserve the matter safe. Earthen, and Glass Cucurbits, with their heads, do serve for a great many Operations. Matrasses both great and small, when they are fitted to the nose of a Limbeck, are called Receivers; at other times we put things into them to digest: and they are also fit for sublimations. When the neck of one Matrass is put into the neck of another, they are called a double vessel, and this is done when we desire to circulate Spirits, but then the junctures must be very well luted. Image 36 (page 36)You must also provide many large capacious Recipients for the Distillation of Acid Spirits by a Retort. They must be so very large, that the Spirits may have room to Circulate the better. Lingots are Iron molds of divers shapes, into which melted Metals are wont to be poured, in order to harden in the form that we would have them. That which is used for the making Lapis infernalis must consist of two pieces joined together with two little Iron rings, and the melted matter is poured into the upper part of it. See its figure in the second Table. Coppels are porous vessels made in form of a cup, to be used for the trying and purifying of Gold and Silver. They are made of Ashes well washt, or of bones calcined. See their figure in the second Table. Ashes deprived of their salts are rather used than others, for the composition of this sort of vessels, that they may be made the more porous, by such deprivation. See the Chapter concerning Purification of Silver by the Coppel, and the Remarks upon it. Many glass Funnels great and small, Viols of glass, Crucibles, Pans, Mortars of glass or stone, or Marble or Iron, must not be forgotten. Aludels must also have a place there; they are Pots without a bottom, joyned together, and are placed over another Pot with a whole in the middle, to serve for Sublimations.   Page 37 Of Lutes. The Fire is often raised to so high a degree as will melt glass Retorts in a Reverberatory Furnace, wherefore it will be convenient to coat them over with such a Lute, as when dry is able to preserve and contain the matter that is put into them to be distill'd. This Lute may be made after the manner which follows. Take Sand, the dross of Iron, Potters earth in powder, of each five pounds, horse-dung cut small a pound, glass beaten into powder, and Sea-salt, of each four ounces, mix them all, and with a sufficient quantity of water make a Paste or Lute, with which you must coat the Retort all round, to half its neck, and so set it a drying. This same Lute will serve to stop close the junctures of the neck of the Retort with the Recipient; but because when it dries, it grows exceeding hard, and it proves difficult to unlute it, it is needful to wet it with wet clothes, when you would take the Retort asunder from the Receiver. The Lute that I commonly use my self for such occasions, is compounded only of two parts of Sand, and one of clay tempered together with water. As for the conjunction of Limbecks, ordinary Glue upon paper will serve turn: but when something very spirituous is distilled, such as the Spirit of Wine, use a wet Bladder, which carries a Glue along with it, that sticks very well. But if the bladder happens to be eaten or corroded by Image 37 (page 38) the Spirits, have recourse to the following Glue. Take Flower, and Lime slackt, of each an ounce, Potters-earth in powder half an ounce, mix them, and make a moist Paste with a sufficient quantity of the Whites of Eggs well beaten before hand with a little water. This Paste may likewise serve to stop the cracks that happen in glass vessels, there must be three lays of the Paste bound on with paper. To Seal Hermetically, is to stop the mouth or neck of a Glass-Vessel with a pair of Pincers heated red hot. To do this, the neck is heated by little and little with burning coals, and the fire is encreased and continued, until the Glass is ready to melt. This way of sealing a Vessel is used, when you have put some matter within it that is easie to be exalted, and you have a mind to make it Circulate.   Of the Degrees of Fire. To make a Fire of the First Degree, two or three coals lighted will suffice to raise a most gentle heat. For the Fire of the second degree, three or four coals will serve, to give such a heat as is able sensibly to warm the Vessel, but so as a hand may be able to endure it for some time. For the Fire of the Third degree, you must cause heat enough to make a Pot boil, that is fill'd with five or six quarts of water. Page 39For the Fourth Degree, you must use Coals and Wood together, enough to give the most extream heat of all. The Fire of Sand, of the filings of Iron, and of Ashes, is made, when the Vessel that contains the matter that is to be heated is covered underneath and on all sides with Sand, or the filings of Iron, or with Ashes; this is done to heat the Vessel the more gently. All these Fires have their Degrees, but the Ash-fire is the mildest, because the Ashes cannot contain so great a heat as the others. The Reverberatory Fire is made in a close Furnace, that the heat or flame which always tends upwards, may reverberate or return upon the Vessel which is placed on two Iron bars. This fire hath its Degrees, but may be raised to a greater violence than the rest. The Wheel fire, for Fusion, is made when with lighted coals you encompass all round a Crucible, that holds the matter you desire to melt. The Balneum Mariae is, when an Alembick containing the matter that is to be heated, is placed in a Vessel filled with Water, under which the Fire is made; thus the water growing hot, heats the matter contained in the Alembick. The Vaporous Bath is, when a Glass vessel containing some Matter is heated by the vapour of hot water.   Image 38 (page 40) Explication of many Terms that are used in Chymistry. To Alcoholize, or reduce into Alcohol, signifies to Subtilize, as when a Mixt is beaten into an impalpable powder. This word is also used to express a very pure Spirit; thus the Spirit of Wine well rectified is called the Alcohol of Wine. Amalgamate is to mix Mercury with some melted Metal; this Operation serves to render the Metal fit to be extended on some Works, as Gold, or else to reduce it into a very subtile powder, which is done by putting the Amalgame into a Crucible over the Fire: for the Mercury subliming into the Air leaves the Metal in an impalpable powder; neither Iron nor Copper can by any means be Amalgamated. Cement is a manner of purifying Gold. 'Tis done by stratification with a hard paste made of one part of Salt Armoniack, two of common Salt, and four of Potters earth, or Bricks powdered, the whole having been moistned with a sufficient quantity of Urine: this Composition is called Royal Cement. Circulation is a motion given to liquors contained in a double vessel, excited by fire, and causing the vapours to ascend and descend to and fro. This operation tends either to subtilize the liquors, or to open some hard body that is mixed with them. Page 41Coagulate, is to give a consistence to liquids, by evaporating some part of them over the fire, or else by mixing liquors together that are of a different nature. Cohobate signifies to repeat the Distillation of the same liquor, having poured it again upon the matter that remains in the Vessel. This Operation is used to open Bodies, or to Volatilize the Spirits. Congele, is to let some matter that is melted fix, or grow into a consistence, as when we let a metal cool, after it has been melted in a Crucible; or else it is when wax, fat, butter, or the like, are taken from the fire and set to cool. Detonation is a noise that is made when the Volatile parts of any mixture do rush forth with impetuosity; it is also called Fulmination. Digestion is, when some body is put to steep or infuse in a convenient menstruum, over a very gentle heat. Dissolve, is to turn some hard matter out of a hard into a liquid form, by means of a certain liquor. To Distil per ascensum, is, when fire is put under the Vessel that contains the matter which is to be heated. To Distil per descensum, is, when fire is placed over the matter that is to be heated; for then the moist parts being rarified, and the vapour which rises from them not being able to arise away upwards as it would do if not hindred, it precipitates and distils at the bottom of the vessel. Edulcorate, is to sweeten some matter, that is impregnated with Salts, by means of common water. Image 39 (page 42)Extract, is to separate the purer part from the grosser. Fermentation is an ebullition raised by the Spirits that endeavour to get out of a Body; for meeting with gross earthy parts that oppose their passage, they swell and rarifie the liquour until they find their way out; Now in this separation of parts, the Spirits do divide, subtilize and separate the principles so, as to make the matter be of another nature than it was before. Filtrate is to purifie a Liquor by passing it through a Coffin of brown paper. Fumigate is to make one Body receive the Fume of another. Granulate is to pour a melted Metal drop by drop into cold water, that it may congeal into grains. Levigate is to reduce a hard Body into an impalpable powder upon a marble. Mortifie is to change the outward form of a Mixt, as is done in Mercury. Also Spirits are said to be Mortified, when they are mixed with others that hinder or destroy their strength. Precipitate is to separate a matter that is dissolved, so as to make it fall or settle at the bottom. Rectifie is to Distil Spirits, for the separation of what Heterogeneous parts might have been drawn along with them. Reverberate is to cause the flame of the Wood or coals that's lighted in the Furnace, to beat back upon the Vessel, by means of a Dome placed over it. Page 43Revive is to restore a Mixt to its former condition that lies disguised by Salts or Sulphurs. Thus Cinnabar, and the other preparations of Mercury are Revived into Quick-silver. Stratifie is to lay different matters bed upon bed. This operation is performed when we would Calcine a Mineral or Metal with a Salt, or some other matter. Sublime is to raise by Fire any Volatile matter to the top of the Cucurbit, or into its Head.    Image 40 (unnumbered page) Page 45 THE FIRST PART. Of Minerals. WHatsoever is found Petrified in the Earth, or upon the Earth is called Mineral. Petrification is made by a Coagulation of acid or salt waters, that are found in the pores of the Earth. This Petrification differs according to the divers dispositions, or different nature of the Earth, and according to the time that Nature uses in its perfection. The growth of Minerals proceeds from an accumulation, or from several veins of congeled Waters, that do as it were glue together, and these veins are the cause that all the adjacent parts have their Sinus, and meetings a travers one another, and not running directly downwards. These Sinus, like so many joints, are of great help to Labourers to cut in the Quarries; for by those cavities the stones are in great measure separated before hand, whereas 'twould be extream hard working them out, if nature had not so concurred. The growth of Minerals is very different from that of Vegetables, and Animals; for whereas the Image 41 (page 46) former does happen through an agglutination of congeled waters, as I have said; the latter is performed by means of juices that insinuate and spread in the vessels and fibres, that Animals and Plants do consist of. Metals do differ from other Minerals in being malleable, which the others are not. They are counted seven, Gold, Silver, Iron, Tinn, Copper, Lead, and Quicksilver, this last is not malleable of it self, but is so mingled with the others; and because this is thought to be the Seed of Metals, it is numbred with the rest. Astrologers have conceited that there was so great an affinity and correspondence between the Seven Metals before named, and the seven Planets, that nothing hapned to the one, but the others shared in it; they made this correspondence to happen through an infinite number of little bodies that pass to and from each of them; and they suppose these corpuscles to be so figured that they can easily pass through the pores of the Planet and Metal they represent, but cannot enter into other bodies because their pores are not figured properly to receive them; or else if they do chance to get admittance into other bodies, they can't fix and stay there to contribute any nourishment; for they do imagine that the Metal is nourished and perfected by the Influence that comes from its Planet, and so the Planet again the same from the Metal. For these reasons they have given these seven Metals the name of the seven Planets, each accordingly as they are governed: and so have called Gold the Sun, Silver the Moon, Iron Mars, Quicksilver Page 47 Mercury, Tinn Jupiter, Copper Venus, and Lead Saturn. They have likewise fancied that each of these Planets has his day apart to distribute liberally his Influence on our Hemisphere; and so they tell us that if we work upon Silver on Munday, Iron on Tuesday, and so of the rest, we shall attain our end much better than on other days. Again they have taught us that the seven Planets do every one govern some particular principal part of our bodies; and because the Metals do represent the Planets, they must needs be mighty specifick in curing the distempers of those parts, and keeping them in good plight. Thus they have assigned the Heart to Gold, the Head to Silver, the Liver to Iron, the Lungs to Tinn, the Reins to Copper, and the Spleen to Lead. Thus you see in short what some of the most sober Astrologers do fancy concerning Metals, and they draw consequences from hence, which 'twould be too long here to relate. I have told you what the soberest among them say; for nothing can be so absurd as what some of them would have us believe. 'Tis no hard matter to disprove these conceits, and shew how groundless they are; for no body ever yet got near enough to the Planets, to satisfie himself whether they are really of the same nature with Metals, or whither any Effluviums of bodies do fall from them to us. Nevertheless if we could be satisfied that Experience did confirm what these persons have offered to maintain, we might then have some reason to think there were some likelihood in their Image 42 (page 48) doctrine, although their principles were found to be altogether false; but in truth there's nothing to confirm their Opinion, and we find it every day plain enough, that the Faculties and Virtues are utterly false, which they do attribute to the Planets and Metals; the Metals indeed are of good use in Physick, and excellent Remedies may be drawn from them; but their effects may better be explicated by Causes nearer at hand than the Stars.  CHAP. I. Of Gold. GOLD is most esteemed among the seven Metals, because it is more perfect, more weighty, and is thought to receive the influence of the most glorious body among the Stars, which is the Sun. It is also called the King of Metals, for the same reason; it is a matter the most compact of any, malleable, unequal in its parts; insomuch that Pores of different figures are observed in it, when it is viewed with a good Microscope. Gold is found in Mines in several places, both in Europe, and other parts of the world; it is usually attended with Water and very hard stones, such as are extream hard to dig; there are likewise Page 49 with several stones that contain particles of Gold, such as are called Golden Marcassites, the Lapis Lazuli, and Lapis Armenus. Gold will spread under the hammer more than any other Metall; it is beaten into leaves exceeding fine, for the use of Gilders, and to be used occasionally in Physick; they will easily mix in compositions, and with powders. Covetousness that has always prevailed on the minds of mankind has not left the Chymists without continual hopes of making Gold by their Art, they have conceited that the production of Gold was the End that Nature always aims at in all her Mines, and that she's hindred in her design, as oft as she produces other Metals which are called Imperfect. And upon this fancy they have spared no time, nor pains, nor cost, in exalting and perfecting these other Metals, and turning them into Gold; this is that which they call the Grand Operation of all, or the search after the Philosophers stone. Some of them to compass their end do make a mixture of these metals with such other matters as serve to purifie them from their grosser parts, and work their Preparations with great fires, others do put them a Digesting in Spirituous liquors, in imitation of Nature that always uses a gentle Heat in her Operations, and so do reduce them into a state of Corruption, to draw thereby their Mercury, which they think to have the aptest disposition to make Gold. Others again do search after the seed of Gold, in Gold it self, and these make no doubt to find it there, as the seed of a Vegetable is more likely to be found in the Vegetable it self Image 43 (page 50) than otherwhere; in order to this they open the body of Gold by proper Dissolvents, then set it a digesting either by a Lamp-fire, or the heat of the Sun, or that of Dung, or some other degree of Fire, to be kept all along at an equal height, and such as is nearest to a Natural heat, and this to draw out the Mercury of Gold; for they are perswaded that if they could once obtain this same Mercury, sowing it in the Earth, it would bring forth Gold, as certainly as a seed does a Plant. Another sort of these men do take wonderful pains to find out the seed of Gold in Minerals, as in Antimony for example, thinking there's a sulphur and Mercury in it as like to those in Gold as can be. Others hope to find it out in Vegetables, and things that come from them, as in Honey, Manna, Sugar, Wine, Rosa solis, Rosemary, Spleenwort. And others pursue after it in Animals, and in their Gums, Bloud, Urin. But the most Curious and delicate of all, who think all the rest but Fools in comparison with them, do hunt after the seed of Gold in the Sun, and in the Dew; for the wisdom of Astrologers has found out that the Sun is a Body all of Gold melted in the Center of the World, and Coppel'd by the fire of the stars that environ it about; nay they dare affirm that this same Gold when it was a purifying did sparkle as Gold does in the Coppel. I should never make an end of this subject, if I should speak of the labours, and pains, watchings, vexations and frettings, and especially the cost these unfortunate men do plunge themselves into, in following their several fancies; they are so Page 51 extremely prepossessed with the conceit of becoming Rich all of a sudden, that they are altogether uncapable of any sober admonition, and they shut their ears to any thing that can be said to disabuse them; so that all other Philosophers, that are not besotted with their fantastical opinions, are by them thought and called Prophane, reserving to themselves the name of the only True Philosophers, or Philosophers paramount. But the saddest consideration of all is, to see a great many of them, who have spent all the flower of their years, in this desperate concern, in which nevertheless they pertinaciously run on, and consume all they have, at last instead of recompence for their miserable fatigues, reduced to the lowest degree of poverty. Penotus will serve us for an instance of this nature, among thousands of others, he died a hundred years old wanting but two, in the Hospital of Yverdon in Switzerland, and he used to say before he died, having spent his whole life in vainly searching after the Philosophers stone, that if he had a mortal Enemy he did not dare to encounter openly, he would advise him above all things to give up himself to the Study and Practice of Alchymy. This man did indeed at last perceive his error and folly, and did acknowledge that he had spent his time most unfortunately and idly; but there are few men who prove so ingenuous as to do so; for they think that their honour is concerned in maintaining whatever error they have once openly defended, and they are quite ashamed to have it believed, that they had laboured in vain, so long, and spent their substance in an enterprize Image 44 (page 52) that had not good probability of success. Many of them to avoid such reproaches, and to make the world believe that they have found out some realities, and especially to engage some particular person, they have designs upon, to joyn with them in the pursuit of their projects, have contrived a great many cheating Legerdemain tricks, some with the pretended Powder of Projection, others with their Aurum Potabile, some by fixing Mercury with Copper, or Verdegreese, lastly others with Cinnaber, which they turn into Silver. They say for themselves that their Powder of Projection is the Seed of Gold it self, which seed has the faculty of multiplying or encreasing the Gold, when some small quantity of it is used. And to give a proof of their skill, they put some melted Gold over the fire, then they cast a little of their powder into it, they stir about the matter with a rod of iron, or some other metal, then they cast their Gold into an iron mold, and it proves to have received a considerable augmentation. At first this Experiment surprizes strangely the spectators, and they are ready to cry out, a Miracle, a Miracle. Then some are greedy to buy this Powder of Projection, but the Artist will not part with it, unless he is paid dearly for it. The purchaser thinks he has now got the Bird sure in the nest, he runs in haste home to make multiplication of his Gold, he melts it, flings in the powder, stirs the matter about, lastly, he observes the same circumstances he had seen observed before, but at last finds that his Gold has made no increase Page 53 of its weight. Then he thinks he failed in some thing that was to have been done, and so begins the Operation again, once, or twice, but all in vain, he poor man can make no Augmentation, and finds too late that he has been wretchedly imposed upon. Now the mystery of this egregious knavery was thus: He that stirs the matter, is privately provided with several small pieces of Gold, to convey dextrously into the Crucible, or Coppel, at different times, so cunningly that none of the Assistants does at all perceive it; but when he finds that he is too narrowly observed, and foresees that it will be too hard for him to slip in any more Gold to that which is melted, without being discovered, he then takes a rod of iron or copper, in the end of which he has inlaid Gold so as it may not be discovered, and then stirs about the melted Gold with this artificial rod. The copper or iron melts, and with it the other Gold mixes with the rest, and so makes an Augmentation. Now if any body demands what is become of the end of the rod, he answers as plainly enough appears, that it is separated into dross, for copper cannot mix with the body of Gold. And if we should examine further into the Powder of Projection, we should find that it is only Quick-silver in Powder, or some such matter, that consumes away by the heat of the fire, or else turns into dross. Their Aurum Potabile which they crack with so loud, and which they sell at so dear a price, is commonly nothing else but a tincture of some Vegetable or Mineral, whose colour comes near to that of Gold, and because this Tincture is prepared Image 45 (page 54) with some spirituous Menstruum, it sometimes causes a breathing sweat. Now this diaphoretick effect they never fail to attribute unto Gold, which yet generally is no occasion of it. This same cheat of theirs is none of the least that they use to get by, for in point of Medicins, abundance of people prove extreme credulous, and especially when an �niversal medicine is talk'd of, such as they pretend their Aurum Potabile to be. Now I shall shew in the sequel, that the business of Aurum Potabile is in reality a mere Chimaera. They prepare their Mercury by fixing its body with Verdegreese, and thus they prepare a matter that comes very near to the colour of Gold; for the Verdegreese, which is a kind of Copper does give the Mercury a yellow colour, and for fear it should not be coloured high enough to their purpose, they colour it with Turmerick, or some such thing of the like quality: and now they will needs perswade the world that they have performed the feat, even of making Gold; but if a man will never so little examine this pretended Gold by the Coppel, the whole flies away in fumes, as quicksilver does commonly use to do. Now if after such trial a man tells them, that their Gold is all gone into the air, they answer for themselves, that indeed this Gold had not received its last Fixation, but that the main business of it being thus atchieved, they make no doubt by working a little longer upon it they shall soon find out the way of fixing it wholly, and bringing it to its last perfection. But again, if they could fix their matter so as to make it resist and undergo the Coppel (which is a thing in a manner impossible) still they would Page 55 not be able to maintain their Assertion that they had made Gold; for there are several other trials that their matter must be able to pass, such as the dissolution by Aqua Regalis, the Depart, the being malleable, the weight of its substance, without all which qualifications it can never be properly called Gold. Moreover they have a way of turning Cinnaber into Silver, and this contrivance is full of curiosity. And thus they use to do it: They stratifie Cinnaber grosly bruised in a Crucible, with Silver in grains: they set the Crucible in a great fire, and after some time for its Calcination they take it off, and pour the matter into a bason, and then they shew the Cinnaber, pretending it to be turn'd into true Silver, although the forefaid grains do remain in the form they had before. Hence they conclude the possibility of Transmutation of metals, because the Mercury of the Cinnaber is turned into Silver, whereas the Silver did remain as it was before. This Experiment amazes people much, and it is hard to see those same pieces of Cinnaber, which were put into the Crucible before them, chang'd from Mercury into pure silver, without inclining to believe an Augmentation of this last metal; nay, many conclude that there remains no longer doubt of it. And men continue possest with this error, until some body has the curiosity of examining the granulated silver, and then the abuse begins to be discovered, for it is found to be exceeding light, and if it be prest between the hands, it crushes in pieces as easily as membranes. The Augmentation comes to be no longer believ'd, Image 46 (page 56) when the grained pellicles are weighed with the pieces of Cinnaber, for the whole weighs no more than the silver in grain did before it was put into the Crucible. Lastly, it must of necessity happen (which appears very strange) that the Mercury does first Amalgamate with the silver, that it conveighs this silver into the pieces of Cinnaber, and then being evaporated over the fire, it leaves the silver all alone. I could here relate divers other subtle inventions of Alchymists, by which they too often impose on such as have plenty of mony, to make them become fellow-partners with them in their Operations; but I should prove too tedious on this subject, I have only toucht upon them by the by, in order to disabuse such men as are prepossest with an opinion of the Transmutation of metals. Although I cannot absolutely deny, but that some certain Artist, by a particular method, might have got the way of making Gold heretofore, nor that some body may be as lucky in time to come; yet there is more appearance of Impossibility than possibility in the case, because of the small knowledge that any of us have of the Natural Composition of this mixt; for seeing that Gold as well as Silver is drawn from Mines environed with Waters, it is very probable that these Waters do bring along with them some Saline Principles that congele and incorporate in Earths of a particular composition, and whose Pores are disposed in such a manner as 'tis impossible for Art to imitate. Nevertheless in order to make Gold, a perfect knowledge of the Salts that the Waters of the Mines do convey, is very requisite as well as the Page 57 disposition of the Matrixes or Earths in which they do congele. Wherefore a man must be soundly prejudiced, before he can believe that by the help of artificial fires, he can concoct metals so as to turn them into Gold. As for the Mercury which men pretend to draw out of Minerals and Metals, and which they believe to be the seminal principle of Gold, it is a thing meerly imaginary; for first of all, it is a great question and may be doubted, whether there be any Mercury in those metallick matters wherein it is sought after, but if we should suppose it in them, what reason shall we have to make it be the seed of Gold? we can no ways find that Mercury is able to produce Gold, nay further, as I said before, the growth of metals and minerals is quite of another nature than that of Vegetables. Now say they, the seed of Gold is communicated unto all bodies, and that it does abound in the Universal Spirit. And because Manna, Dew, Hony, are impregnated with this Spirit, that Gold may by Art be drawn out of those substances. We grant unto them, that the Universal Spirit does contain an Acid which serves towards the production of Gold, because the acid waters or salts which do enter into the composition of this metal, do proceed from the Universal Spirit; but if you go to call this acid a seed, it will prove to be the seed of all other mixt bodies as well as that of Gold, and there's no more reason for thinking that the Universal Spirit does abound in the seed of Gold, than in the seed of the grossest metal, or the most unuseful plant, or the most contemptible of animals; so that we may conclude, that to spend Image 47 (page 58) ones time in making of Gold, seems properly to lose it by working in the dark, and I find that Alchymy has been very well defined to be, Ars fine arte, cujus principium mentiri, medium laborare, & finis mendicare, an Art without any Art, whose beginning is Lying, whose middle is nothing but Labour, and whose end is Beggery. Gold is a good Remedy for those who have taken too much Mercury; for these two Metals do easily unite together, and by this union or Amalgamation the Mercury fixes, and its motion is interrupted. This is plainly enough perceived in such as have received the Frictions with Mercury; for if they do but hold a piece of Gold in their mouth a little, it will grow white by the vapour of the Quicksilver. Gold taken inwardly is thought to be a most potent Cordial, because Astrologers tell us it receives its Influence from the Sun, which is as it were the Heart of the world, and by the communication of those Influences to the heart, it serves to fortifie and cleanse it from all impurities; upon which ground a great many Operations have been invented in order to open this Metal, and separate its Sulphur from its salt. Moreover this Operation by way of bravery is called Aurum Potabile, because this salt or this Sulphur dissolving in a Liquor, can be taken by way of Potion: And because this Aurum Potabile can be thought to be distributed into all parts of the body, they fancy it can drive out every thing that interrupts the Functions of Nature, that it can free him that takes it from all fear of any Diseases for a long time, and can prolong life. Page 59But this Opinion is built upon a weak foundation, and Experience does not confirm any of these glorious effects; for what assurance can we have, or what Evidence is there, that the Sun is such a great friend of Gold, or that it bestows more Influence on it, than on other mixt bodies; it is a thing that can never be prov'd, and we fee that the Sun casts its light and heat in general upon all bodies, without making any difference. Who can understand, that the Pores of Gold are so disposed, as to have a greater facility of retaining the Suns Influences, than other metals or things? This will be full as hard to prove as the other. But though we should grant Astrologers this supposition concerning the Suns Influence on Gold, the consequence they draw from it, that therefore it Fortifies the heart, would be ne're a-whit the truer; for all that we are able to apprehend in Gold is, that it is a most compact and weighty body, the union of whose Principles is extraordinary close; which is proved from hence, that no Art can instruct us to dissolve it Radically, so as to separate its salt, and its sulphur. This Gold being beaten into the thinnest Leaves that can be imagined, and taken inwardly receives not the least change in our bodies, and is voided the very same it was before, excepting when Quicksilver has been taken beforehand, for it unites with that, as I have said. Wherefore we must conclude, that if Gold has received more Influence from the Sun than other Metals, yet it is never the fitter to dissolve in our Bodies, nor to produce those rare effects that are talkt of. Image 48 (page 60)I know that stories are told to prove, that Gold does communicate virtue to the bodies of those who have taken it, and that it loses in the body some of its quantity; and among other stories 'tis said, that several persons, who had fed upon Capons, nourished with a Paste made of a mixture of Vipers flesh and Gold together, have been cured that way of several Diseases; but there's a great deal more reason to attribute this effect rather to the Vipers than Gold; for we know by experience that Vipers taken inwardly without any thing else, do use to produce divers sensible effects, whereas we observe none at all in Gold, when 'tis given alone. As for the diminution they imagine of Gold in bodies, they prove it by their gathering together all the Excrements of those Capons, and Calcining them, for they could obtain again but the fourth part of the Gold that was used in the Paste the Capons had fed upon. But this proof is as weak as the former; for the Excrements of the Capons being full of a Volatile Salt, that Salt may have Volatiliz'd and carried away the greatest part of the Gold during the Calcination, after the same manner as we see several Volatile liquors to sublime Gold. I know well enough by my own Experience, that there are such Volatiles as are able to sublime Gold; for having one day mixed three ounces of Gold with about three pounds of matter consisting of divers Volatile ingredients, I put the mixture about a month afterwards into the Coppel, and the Gold appeared very resplendent in the middle of the mixture; but blowing, as we use to do, in its purification, I was astonished to see it Exalt away by little and little into the air, until there was not a grain of it left. Page 61Thus no body can be assured that Gold did nourish those Capons; but besides, though some of it should be dissolved in the body, as it does in Aqua Regalis, which is very hard to conceive; though some of it should exalt, nay though some should plainly glitter in the Chyle, here's no proof nevertheless that it produces such wonderful effects. Now although I have asserted that Gold taken alone does not receive any change as for health, yet I value very much several preparations of Gold made with Spirits; for 'tis these Spirits that give certain determinations to Gold according to their nature, and make it operate as it does. When I speak of Aurum Fulminans, I shall give an instance of what I now say.  Purification of Gold. To Purifie Gold is to separate from it the other Metals which are mixed with it. Put as much Gold as you please into a Crucible, make it red hot, and when it begins to melt, cast into it four times as much Antimony in powder, the Gold will presently melt; continue a strong Fire, until you perceive the Matter to sparkle. Then take your Crucible out of the Fire and knock it, that the Regule may fall to the bottom. Break it when it is cold, and separate the Regule from the dross that remains a top of it. If you have a mind to save your Crucible, pour out the matter that lies in Fusion into an Iron Mortar made like a Founders Mould, which you shall have heated a little and greased before-hand, then strike about Image 49 (page 62) the Mortar with pincers, till the matter settles in a Mass. Let this Mass cool a little, then flinging it out, separate the Golden Regule from the dross. Weigh this Regule, melt it again in a Crucible over a strong Fire, and when it shall come to melt, throw into it by little and little three times as much Salt-peter: continue a good strong Fire, that the matter may remain in Fusion, and when the Fumes are all gone, and it appears clear and clean, cast it into your Iron Mortar warm'd and greas'd as I said but now, or else leave it in the Crucible that you shall beat while it is cooling, for the separation of the Regule from the Dross that remains a top, and your Golden Regule will prove perfectly pure.  Remarks. The ordinary way of purifying Gold is the Coppel, in which the same method is used that I shall speak of in the Purification of Silver. But the Coppel not being able to separate Silver from Gold, recourse is had to another Operation, that is called the Depart. Melt three parts of Silver with one part of Gold, in a Crucible over a good Fire, and when this mixture is in Fusion, cast it into cold water, and it condenses into Grains, which being dried, a separation of the Silver from the Gold is made by the means of Aqua fortis; for this Menstruum dissolves Silver very well, but the Gold remains in powder at the bottom of the Vessel, for the Page 63 reason that I shall relate in the Chapter of Aqua Regalis. The Dissolution of Silver is poured off by Inclination, then the Powder of Gold is washed to be made sweet. But it often happens that some particles of the Silver do still remain united with the Gold, so that this Purification cannot be said to be altogether perfect. There is another method of Purifying Gold, to wit, Cementation, which is thus performed. Stratifie in a Crucible thin plates of Gold, with a dry paste, that is called Cement, in which the Salts Gemma and Armoniack do enter; cover the Crucible, and having made a fire round about it, Calcine the matter for ten or twelve hours with a violent heat, that the Salts may eat and consume the impurities of the Gold: but nevertheless they often leave it still impregnated with other Metals. The Purification at Gold by the means of Antimony is better than any other; for there is nothing but Gold that is able to make resistance against this devourer; it often eats some portion of it, but never leaves it in any other Metal. You must remember to lay a Tile under the Crucible, for fear that the air which comes by the Ashhole, should happen to cool the bottom of the Crucible. Gold presently melts as soon as Antimony is cast into the Crucible, by reason that Antimony contains some Saline Sulphurs, which do encrease the force of the Fire, and do separate the parts of this Metal; it is then that the more porous and volatile part uniting with the Antimony, one part evaporates away in Smoke, and the other remains fixt in the Dross. Image 50 (page 64)The sparkles which toward the end do fly out of the matter do proceed from some Particles of Antimony, which finding themselves intangled in the Gold do use violence to get out. Then take your matter off the Fire that it may lose none of its substance, and pour it into an Iron Mortar as I said before. After this the Regule is melted once more, and Salt-peter cast into it to absorb or receive all the Antimony that may yet remain, and so by this means you have a Regule as well purified as may be, and even that of four and twenty Caratts, if there be any such Gold. A Carat of Gold is properly the weight of one Scruple, or four and twenty grains, and four and twenty Caratts make an ounce. If you take an ounce of Gold, and find that it loses not a jot in the Purifications that may be made of it, this is called Gold of four and twenty Caratts; if it be found to have diminished but one Caratt, then it is said to be Gold of three and twenty Caratts; if it loses two Caratts, then it is Gold of two and twenty Caratts, and so of the rest. But it is commonly held that there is no such thing to be found as Gold of four and twenty Caratts, because there is none but contains some small proportion of Silver, or Copper, purifie it as much as you will. Red Gold is the less valuable, because it contains the more Copper, which gives it this colour; the Yellow is the better, and it ought to remain Yellow, even whilst it is in the fire. A Caratt of Pearls, Diamonds, and other precious stones, is but four grains.    Page 65 Amalgamation of Gold with Mercury, and its reduction into an impalpable Powder. To Amalgamate Gold is to mix it with Quicksilver. Take a Drachm of the Regule of Gold, beat it into very thin little Plates, which you must heat in a Crucible red hot in a large Fire; then pour upon it an ounce of Quicksilver revived from Cinnaber, as I shall shew hereafter; stir the matter with a little Iron-rod, and when you find it begin to raise a fume which quickly happens, cast your mixture into an Earthen Pan fill'd with Water, it will coagulate, and become tractable; wash it several times to take away its blackness; thus you have an Amalgame, from which you must separate the Mercury that you find not united, by pressing it a little between your fingers in a linnen cloth. The Gold retains about thrice its weight in Mercury. Now to reduce this Gold into Powder, you must put this Amalgame into a Crucible over a gentle fire, the Mercury will evaporate into the Air, and leave the Gold at bottom in an impalpable Powder.  Remarks. Mercury doth easily penetrate Gold, and insinuating into its Pores makes a soft matter that is called Amalgame; it doth the same with other Metals Image 51 (page 66) too, except Iron and Copper, which are too ill digested to receive its impression. The Amalgamation of Gold is useful to Gilders, for so it is easily extended upon their works.    Aurum Fulminans, called Saffron of Gold. This Operation is a Gold impregnated with some Spirits, which cause it to give a loud crack, when it is set over the Fire. Take what quantity you please of Gold beaten into thin plates, put it into a Viol, or Matrass, and pour upon it by little and little three or four times as much Aqua Regalis compounded after the manner I shall shew in its proper place. Set the Matrass upon Sand a little heated, until the Aqua Regalis has dissolved as much of the Gold as it is able to contain, which you will know by the ceasing of the ebullitions, pour your solution into a Glass-vessel of five or six times as much common Water. Afterwards drop into this mixture by degrees the Volatile Spirit of Salt Armoniack, or the Oyl of Tartar made by Deliquium or Solution, you'l find the Gold precipitate to the bottom of the Glass. Let it alone a good while to settle, that all the Gold may fall down, then pouring off the Water by Inclination wash your powder with warm Water, till it grows insipid, and so dry it in Paper at a gentle fire, because it is apt to fire, and the Powder would fly away with a terrible noise. If you use one drachm of Gold, you will obtain four scruples of Aurum Fulminans well dried. Page 67Aurum Fulminans causes sweat, and drives out ill humors by Transpiration. It may be given in the Small Pox from two to six grains in a Lozenge, or Electuary. It stops Vomiting, and is also good to moderate the activity of Mercury.  Remarks. The Plates of Gold are made use of in this Operation, that its dissolution may be more easily performed. You must pour the Aqua Regalis by little and little, to avoid the great effervescency that might be able to drive it out of the Matrass. The effervescency proceeds from the violent division of the particles of Gold by the Aqua Regalis; for when it finds no more bodies to act upon, having divided the Gold into as many parts as 'tis possible, the ebullition ceases, and though the Gold doth all remain in the Aqua Regalis, it becomes so imperceptible to us, as it seems the Water hath not changed from what it was before, it appears so very clear and transparent. Indeed the solution has received a Golden colour, and becomes yellow. The dissolution of Gold is a suspension of this metal in Phlegm, made by the edges of Aqua Regalis. For it is not enough that the Aqua Regalis does divide the Gold into subtle parts, but it is further requisite that its edges do hold up the Gold, as if it were like so many Finns, otherwise it would always fall to the bottom in a powder, though it were never so subtle. Image 52 (page 68)Now 'tis objected that the particles of Gold should fall to the bottom of the liquor, because they being joined to the points of the Aqua Regalis they are become more heavy than they were before; for the union or adhaesion of two bodies does cause a greater weight, than when the two bodies were separated one from the other. I answer, that we ought to conceive the particles of Gold being suspended or held up in the Phlegm by the acid points, much after the manner as we do conceive very well, that a small piece of metal fixed to a staff or a plank, will swim with the wood in the water; for although the small piece of metal sinks to the bottom when it is alone, yet it swims when it is affixed to the wood; the acid edges are bodies exceeding light in comparison with the particles of Gold, and they have likewise their superficies, more extended, and consequently do take up more room in the phlegm; this is that which holds them up, and causes them to swim. The Oyl of Tartar, or the Spirit of Salt Armoniack is used for the Precipitation of Gold, because both those Liquors do contain an Alkali Salt, which being mixed with Acids must cause a Fermentation. Now in this Fermentation the parts of Aqua Regalis that held up the particles of Gold do grow weak, and having no more force to retain them longer, they must needs precipitate by their own weight. Perhaps some may find a difficulty in comprehending how the Volatile Spirit of Salt Armoniack should come to weaken the Aqua Regalis, that is it self compounded of Salt Armoniack; but Page 69 there will be no difficulty at all, when they shall consider that the force of the Aqua Regalis doth not so much depend on the volatile part of the Salt Armoniack, as on the Sea-salt, that is in good store in it united with the Aqua Fortis; for Sea-salt, or Sal Gemma, may be substituted very well in the place of Salt Armoniack for making Aqua Regalis, as I shall observe hereafter, speaking of the composition of this Water. It may be also enquired here, why the Dissolvents do quit the bodies they held before in Dissolution, to betake themselves to some other: for example, why the Aqua Regalis leaves the Gold it was impregnated with, to give way to the Alkali Salt. This question is one of the most difficult to resolve well, of any in Natural Philosophy. Nevertheless, I'le give you my opinion of what can be said most sensibly on this Subject. I do suppose that when the Aqua Regalis hath acted upon the Gold, so as to dissolve it, the points or edges that enabled it to do so, are fixed in the particles of Gold. But seeing that these little bodies are very hard, and consequently hard to penetrate, these points do enter but very superficially, yet far enough to suspend the particles of Gold, and hinder them from precipitating. Wherefore if you would add never so much Gold, more, when these points have seized upon as much as they are able to joyn with, they cannot possibly dissolve one grain more; and it is this suspension that renders the particles of Gold imperceptible. But now if you add some body that by its motion and figure is able to engage the acids enough to break them, the particles of Gold being left at Image 53 (page 70) liberty will precipitate by their own weight. And this is what I conceive the Oyl of Tartar, and Volatile Alkali Spirits are able to do. They are impregnated with very Active Salts, which finding bodies at rest do presently move them, and by the quickness of their motion do shake them so violently, as to break the points by which they were suspended; these fragments of little points being thus disengaged from the Gold, are still keen enough to act, and they have action enough remaining to pierce and divide violently the parts of Alkali Salts, which are much more soluble in their nature than Gold, and this occasions the Ebullition which presently happens when these Spirits are poured upon the Dissolution. These edges then being thus broken, two things must follow thereupon. The first is that the remaining Aqua Regalis is rendred uncapable of dissolving any more Gold, because it hath no more power left of making a penetration. The second is, that the precipitated Powder of Gold is impregnated with some part of the Dissolvent, by reason that the sharpest part of these edges remains within it. Experience teaches us both the one and the other: to wit, the force of the Aqua Regalis is quite destroyed for dissolving any more Gold, and the precipitated Powder hath drawn along with it some Spirits that are so closely lockt up, that though it be several times washt in warm Water, they cannot possibly be disengaged from their hold. And this is evident, when it is put upon the Fire; for the great Detonation, or noise that it makes, cannot proceed from any thing else, but the inclosed Page 71 Spirits which violently divide the most compact body of Gold to get out quickly, when they are forced to it by the action of Fire. I can here explicate by the by, after the same manner, the action of a certain Powder, consisting of three parts of Niter, two parts of Salt of Tartar, and one part of Sulphur. This Powder being heated in a Spoon to the weight of a Drachm, gives as Thundering a noise as a Cannon it self. Now the fixt Salt of Tartar causes in this Powder what the Gold did in the other; that is to say, it retains the Spirits of Niter and Sulphur so lockt up, that they cannot be separated without violently breaking their Prison; and this is that which makes such a noise. Aurum Fulminans taken inwardly causes sweat, because the heat of the Body volatilises it, and drives it through the Pores. Now if the Pores are very open, it will only cause an insensible transpiration: but if they are closed up by the coldness of the weather, so that it must remain some time before it passes; the vaporous humidity which bears it company, dissolves upon the skin into what we call sweat. Some think the Gold contributes nothing at all to these transpirations, and that the spirit of Niter alone being forced by the heat of the body to pass through its Pores causes all the action. But I conceive it is more likely that these spirits do carry along with them some parts of the Gold, with which they are so intimately mixed. And by this explication may be better comprehended, how so small a quantity of spirits is able to produce sweat; for suppose there passes through the Image 54 (page 72) Pores one grain of Gold, and two grains of spirits, these spirits being as I may so say, armed with the grosser parts of Gold, will be better able to conquer the resistance that shall oppose their passage, than if they were separate; after the same manner as a good piece of Timber that is driven along by the stream of a River will strike with much more violence against the Arch of a Bridge, and endanger it much more, than a single Wave would be able to do, though never so swift. There are two sorts of insensible Transpirations, one hapening at all times, as well in health as sickness, and the other in a Burning Feaver, or else sometimes upon the taking a Sudorifick. The first Transpiration is insensible, because the vapour which passes continually through the pores is yet in so small a quantity, that though it does dissolve in a moisture upon the skin, it is not perceived at all. The other is caused by a great motion of the Spirits which drive the humours through the pores of the body after a rapid manner, and whereas at that time the pores become very open, and the skin is heated more than ordinarily, the vapour passes away through the skin without condensing upon it. But if once the rapid motion of humours begins to slacken, then the sweat appears, and begins to be felt; and this does happen in Agues, for during the great heat of the Ague, men do not sweat at all, but only in the declination of the fit; because then the skin somewhat cools, the vapour condenses into a moisture, which we call sweat; wherefore sweat may be said to issue from a middle degree of heat, between the first insensible Transpiration, and the second. Page 73Most men think that there goes out more moisture in the time of the sweat, than by the insensible Transpiration which is made during the height of the hot fit; but they seem to be mistaken very likely, for it may easily be conceived, that there should be a greater disposition in the vigour of the fit, than afterwards in the declination, by reason that at that time the heat is greater, and so more able to impel forth effluviums. Distillation in a Retort will confirm what is here maintained. For if you make only a moderate fire under the Retort, the moisture which rises out of the matter will distil drop by drop, because the vapours cooling and condensing in the neck of the Retort do resolve into a liquor; but if you make a great fire in the Furnace, so that the neck of the Retort comes to be heated too much, all the moisture is driven in a meer vapour, and there appears not the least humidity in the neck of the Retort. I have already said, that Gold doth repress the violence of Mercury, because it doth Amalgamate with it; but Aurum Fulminans doth it much better, for being Volatile it is more easily carried through all the body, and fails not to find out the Mercury, wheresoever it lies. We need not fear lest Aurum Fulminans taken inwardly, and heated by the stomach, should cause such a Detonation there, as it does when set over the fire in a spoon; for so much the more moisture as comes to it, so much the less noise does it make. Now it can't be question'd, but there is liquidity enough in the stomach, besides the liquid vehicle 'tis usually given in. There is no need Image 55 (page 74) then of calling in the acids of the stomach, as some do, to unite with the salts of Aurum Fulminans, and drive them out of the body of this Metal: for besides that the most clear and disinterested Explications and such as fall most under our sense, ought always to be preferr'd, 'twould be too hard a matter to maintain that; 'tis true if you wet Aurum Fulminans with the spirit of Vitriol, or Salt, or Sulphur, the Fulmination is thereby hindred, but this happens from the acids fixing by their weight the Volatility of those Salts that remain in the pores of the Gold. In the Chapter of Gold I could reckon up several other Preparations that have been invented, but because they are out of use, I shall not swell this Book with an account of them.     CHAP. II. Of Silver. SIlver hath the second place among Metals, it is a very compact body, more smooth and polished by nature than Gold, and its Pores are more even upon the surface. it is malleable like Gold, but will not so easily yield or extend under the Hammer, and is not so weighty. It is called the Moon, as well from its Colour, as from the Influences our Forefathers thought it Page 75 received from the Moon. Many properties are attributed to it against Diseases of the Head; but these pretended Virtues seem to have no other foundation than the imagination of Astrologers and Chymists, who were of the opinion that the Moon had a great deal of correspondence with the Head. There is no need I should enlarge in confutation of this opinion, experience every day teaches us that it is a pure abuse. Silver may be also given like Gold for Diseases caused by too much Mercury; for they suffer an Amalgation very well together. Whereas there is no certainty, that ever there was drawn out of Gold or Silver any thing that deserves to be called either a Salt, or Sulphur, or Mercury, I have not at all followed the method of Authors, who will needs explicate the differences which are to be found in these Metals, by more or less, of one or two of these Principles. I am contented to relate only that which may be known in Gold and Silver, and I think it better to say little of a thing, and be able to prove my assertion, than form grand Ideas of things that are very doubtful.  Purification of Silver. To Purifie Silver is to separate from it the other metals with which it is mixed. This operation is done by the Coppel after the manner following: Take a Coppel made of the ashes of Bones or Horns, cover it and heat it gently in the coals, until it grows red-hot, then cast it into four or Image 56 (page 76) five times as much Lead as you intend to purifie Silver: let the Lead melt, and fill the sides of the Coppel, which is soon done; then cast your Silver into the middle, and it will presently melt. Lay wood round about the Coppel, and blow it that the flame may reverberate on the matter, the impurities will mix with the Lead, and the Silver remain pure and clean in the middle of the Coppel, while the Lead being fill'd with the drossie parts of Silver lies on the sides like a scumm, that you may gather up with a spoon, and this is that which is called Litharge, which according to the degree of Calcination it hath endured, becomes of divers Colours, and sometimes is called Litharge of Gold, and sometimes Litharge of Silver. If you leave it in the Coppel, it will pass through its Pores. For you must observe that the Coppel being expresly made of ashes deprived of Salt, is very Porous; you must continue the Fire till there rise no more Fumes. This Preparation cleanses Silver from all other Metals, except Gold, which resists the power of the Coppel. You must therefore have recourse to the Operation I described, when I spoke of the Purification of Gold; for Aqua fortis dissolves Silver, but not being able to penetrate Gold, leaves it in a powder at the bottom. Pour off then by Inclination the dissolution of Silver into an Earthen pan, wherein you shall have laid before-hand a plate of Copper, and ten or twelve times as much common Water. Let this mixture lie still for some hours, and when you find the Copper covered all about with the Powder or Precipitate of Silver, and the water becomes Page 77 blue, Filtrate it, and you have that which is called Aqua Secunda: It is good to make the Eschar fall in Chancres, and to consume proud flesh. Dry the powder of Silver, and if you desire to keep it in an Ingot, melt it in a Crucible with a little Salt-peter. If you steep a plate of Iron some hours in the Aqua Secunda, the Copper which made it look blue will precipitate according as the Iron dissolves. If you Filtrate this dissolution, and put a piece of the Lapis Calaminaris into it, the dissolv'd Iron will fall to the bottom in powder, and the Stone will dissolve it. If you Filtrate this water, and pour upon the Filtration drop by drop the water of fixt Niter, the Lapis Calaminaris will precipitate. Lastly, if you Filtrate this water too, and having evaporated a part of it, set the rest a Crystallizing, you'l meet with a Salt-peter that burns like the ordinary sort.  Remarks. The Coppel is an Earthen Vessel that resists the Fire, made like a dish: it is fill'd with a Paste made of ashes that have lost all their Salt, such as those of Bones; which lose all their Salt while they are a burning, because it is so Volatile: a hole is made in the middle to let in the matter that is to be Coppel'd, and so the Vessel is set a drying. You must put Lead into the Coppel, in proportion to the impurities that are in the Silver; commonly they put four times as much. That which is here called Impurity is nothing else but some Image 57 (page 78) parts of other Metals, that superficially adhered to the Silver, when it was taken out of the Mine. These Metals do mix much better with Lead than Silver, because the Lead is full of Sulphureous porous parts which readily engage and receive other Bodies. On the contrary Silver hath Pores exceeding close and strait, and can neither be penetrated nor unite with these Matters but only superficially; so that in the Fusion they do separate and only slide over this Solid body. It is also remarkable that the hardness of Silver, and strait contexture of its parts do hinder the Fire from melting it after the same manner as other Metals, that are more porous; and this is the reason it remains unmixt among them. Silver melts much sooner by being put into melted Lead, than if you had endeavour'd to melt it alone in the Crucible, because Lead contains many Sulphureous parts that are very serviceable for the Fusion of Metals. The flame is made to Reverberate on the Silver, to drive all Heterogeneous substances towards the sides. That which is called a Caratt in Gold, is a Denier, or penny weight in Silver, and thus an ounce of Silver well purified is of four and twenty penny weight, which make 24 times 24 grains. Now this ounce of Silver must lose nothing at all upon trial; but if it should lose one penny weight in the Coppel, the Silver then is said to be that of 23 penny weight, and if it loses two scruples, or penny weight, it is but of 22 Deniers, and so of the rest. There is no Silver to be had of 24 deniers, no more than Gold of 24 Caratts, because there is Page 79 always some mixture with it, use what diligence and application you please in its purification. Plate-silver contains one part of Copper to 24 parts of Silver, and the Coppel-silver contains but a quarter of a part of Copper to four and twenty parts of Silver. The Depart, or parting of Metals, is when a Dissolvent quits the Metal it had dissolved, to betake it self unto another. Thus when Copper is put into the Dissolution of Silver, the Aqua fortis leaves the Silver, to fall upon Dissolving the Copper; and the reason of this is, because the Copper-particles do so stir and shake the edges of the Dissolvent, as to make them let go their hold. Iron precipitates Copper, Lapis Calaminaris precipitates Iron, and the Liquor of fixt Niter doth so to the Lapis Calaminaris for the same reason; but you must observe, that Iron does not precipitate all the Copper, nor the Calaminaris all the Iron, no more than the Copper did precipitate all the Silver: and the reason of this is, that the points of the Aqua fortis having entred more deeply into the great pores of Copper and Iron, are much the harder to be broken by bodies of this nature; but because the liquor of fixt Niter does contain an Alkali much more active than the others, it precipitates all the Lapis Calaminaris, and all the Iron and Copper which did remain dissolved. I shall in the sequel of this Book describe the manner of preparing the Liquor of fixt Niter: the Salt that it contains reunites with the Volatile Spirits of Salt-peter that were in the Aqua fortis, insomuch that the Salt-peter revives again.    Image 58 (page 80) Crystals of Silver, called Vitriol of the Moon. This Operation is a Silver opened, and reduced into the form of Salt by the acid points of Spirit of Niter. Dissolve one or two ounces of Coppel-silver in three times as much Spirit of Niter; pour forth your dissolution into a Glass-Cucurbite, set in a gentle Sand-fire; evaporate about the fourth part of the moisture, and so let the rest cool without stirring it, it will turn into Crystals, which you must separate from the Liquor, and after you have dried them, keep them in a Viol well stopt. You may again fall to Evaporating half the remaining Liquor, and set it a Crystallizing as before. You may repeat these Evaporations and Crystallizations till all your Silver has turned into Crystals. This Vitriol of the Moon is used to make an Eschar by touching the part with it. It is also given inwardly for Dropsies, and for Diseases of the Head, from two unto six Grains, in some Specifick Water: it purges gently. These Crystals might be prepared with Oyl of Vitriol, instead of Spirit of Niter, for inward use.  Remarks. You must put your Silver purified by the Coppel into a Viol or Matrass large enough, and pour upon it only as much Spirit of Niter as will serve to Dissolve it; now that comes to about three Page 81 times its weight. Indeed you may use Aqua fortis instead of Spirit of Niter, if you please, in this Operation; but I rather chuse Spirit of Niter, because it is found to act with more celerity than Aqua fortis. You may read in their proper places the description I have given you of them both, and the Remarks I have made upon them. Place your Vessel in Ashes or Sand, a little warm for to hasten the Dissolution. When the acid Spirits begin to work upon the Silver, an Ebullition presently rises accompanied with a very considerable heat, because these sharp edges do break those obstacles that hindred their entrance, and violently force their passage. It is this great motion, and impetuous dispersion of parts, that produces the heat and ebullition, and by rarefaction of the Spirit of Niter sends forth through the neck of the Vessel a Red fume or vapour, that you must be very careful to avoid, as a thing very unwholsom, and prejudicial to the Breast. The Smoke and Ebullition do remain until the Silver is all of it dissolved, after which the Liquor becomes clear and transparent but a little bluish. If the Silver which is dissolved, were perfectly purified from Copper, the solution would no more be tinged than Spirit of Niter, but because there is none to be found so perfectly pure, it always tinges a little. The solution of Plate-silver is much bluer than that of Silver purified by the Coppel, because the Plate-silver contains more Copper than the other, as I said before. So that the purer the Silver is, the less blue is the solution. A little of it is evaporated, that the rest may Crystallize the easier, for that which evaporates is little better than a kind of Image 59 (page 82) insipid water, the Silver still retaining the Acid fixt Spirits. Now you must observe in all Crystallizations not to leave too much moisture, for fear of weakning too much the Salts, and so hindring their Coagulation. Nor must you leave too little moisture; for the Crystals not finding room enough to extend themselves in, would confusedly fall one upon another. These Crystals can be dissolved in Water like Salt, their strength depends on the Spirits of Niter that are incorporated with them: wherefore they weigh more than the Silver did that was employed; and it is these Spirits which pierce and gnaw the flesh on which these Crystals are applied, when an Eschar is to be made. It is likewise they which cause that Fermentation of humours by which they purge, when these Crystals are given inwardly. The Liquor in which they are dissolved to be taken, and the moisture of the Stomach do serve to correct their acrimony. If you have a mind to revive these Crystals into Silver again, you must only put them into hot Water, and lay therein a plate of Copper. They will then dissolve, and the Silver precipitate to the bottom in a White powder, that is to be washed and dried; afterwards melting it in a Crucible with a little Salt-peter, it will return into Ingots of the same weight as before.    Page 83 Infernal Stone, or perpetual Caustick. The Infernal stone is a Silver rendred Caustick by the Salts of Spirit of Niter. Dissolve in a Viol what quantity of Silver you please, with three times as much Spirit of Niter; set your Viol in a Sand fire, and evaporate about two thirds of the moisture; pour the rest as it is hot into a good German Crucible, that must be large enough by reason of the Ebullitions that are made in it. Place it over a gentle fire, and let it alone till the boiling matter sinks quietly to the bottom of the Crucible. Then encrease your fire a little, and it will come to be like Oyl: pour it out into an Iron mould a little oil'd and heated, it will presently coagulate or harden; after which you may keep it in a Viol well stopt. It is a Caustick that will remain for ever, provided you don't let it be expos'd to the Air. This Stone may be made of Copper instead of Silver, but will not keep so well; because the Copper being very porous doth suffer the Air to enter easily and dissolve it. If you use an ounce of Silver, you'l obtain an ounce and five drachms of the Infernal stone.  Remarks. The Effect of this Stone proceeds from the Corrosive Spirits of Niter, which do remain incorporated with the Silver. It is more Caustick than the Crystals I now spoke of, though compounded Image 60 (page 84) of the same ingredients. The reason of it is, that in the Evaporation of the Spirit of Niter, the sharpest part remains at last; and it is that which gives this strength to the Infernal stone. But in the Crystal there's a much weaker Spirit, as being impregnated with watry parts. When you boil the solution of Silver, you must take care to keep but a gentle fire, for the matter easily rarifies, and rises over into the fire; or else it spirts some drops upon the hand of the Artist, which make it smart grievously, and fetches off the skin, because this liquor is not only very corrosive in it self, but has the assistance of fire to make it the more burning. You must likewise often cast your eye into the Crucible, especially towards the end, that so soon as the matter is observed to cease boiling, and gets the form of an Oyl, you be ready to cast it into the mould, for if you should then leave it longer in the fire, the strongest Spirits would evaporate, and the stone would not be so corrosive. If you would melt the Crystals of the Moon in a Crucible, and boil the Liquor till it come into the consistence of Oyl, and afterwards cast it into the Iron mould, you would have an Infernal stone like this I have described. When Plate silver is used to the making the Infernal stone, an ounce of Silver gains but three drachms in augmentation, but using fine Coppel-silver, you'l get five drachms. This augmentation of weight does proceed from the sharp acids of Spirit of Niter, adhering to the body of silver, but the difference of the increase lies in this, that the Coppel-silver having narrower pores than the Page 85 other does retain the acids better, and the stone is thereby the stronger, as I have found by experience.    Tincture of the Moon. The Tincture of the Moon is a dissolution of some of the more rarified parts of Silver made in Spirit of Wine whetted by Alkali salts. Dissolve in a Matrass upon Sand a little warm two ounces of Silver with six ounces of Spirit of Niter. Pour the dissolution into a Cucurbit, or other Glass-vessel, wherein you shall have put a quart of Salt-water well Filter'd, the Silver will presently precipitate in a very white powder. Let it lye a while that all the Powder may fall, and then pour off the water by Inclination. Wash your Powder several times with Fountain-water to take away the Acrimony of the Salts: dry it upon paper, and put it into a Matrass. Pour upon it an Ounce of the Volatile Salt of Urine, and four and twenty Ounces of the Spirit of Wine Rectified with the Salt of Tartar, after the manner I shall shew hereafter. Stop this Matrass with another: that is to say, let the mouth of the one enter into the neck of the other, and this is that which is called a Double-Vessel. Lute well the junctures with a wet bladder, and digest the Matter in horse-dung, or some such gentle heat, for a Fortnight, during which time the Spirit of Wine will have got a bright Sky-colour. Unlute your Matrass, and Filtrate the Liquor through a Coffin of Brown paper, and so keep it in a Viol well stopt. Image 61 (page 86) You may use this Tincture for the Epilepsie, Palsie, Apoplexy, and other diseases of the Head. It is also used in Malignant Feavers, and all other Diseases wherein it is requisite to drive out the humours by Perspiration. The Dose is from six to sixteen drops in a convenient Vehicle. There will remain at the bottom of the Matrass a Calx of Silver that may again be revived by means of the following Salts. Take Eight ounces of Niter, Two ounces of Crystal powdered according as I shall shew hereafter, so much Tartar, and half an ounce of coals; Powder them all, and put it by little and little into a Crucible heated red-hot, a great Detonation will happen, after which you'l find the matter melted, pour it into a warm Mortar, and let it cool, you'l have a Mass that you must powder, and mix an equal weight of it with so much Calx of Silver. Melt this mixture in a Crucible over a strong fire, and the Calx will revive into Silver: take your Crucible out of the fire, and break it when it is cold, then separate your Silver from the salts.  Remarks. This Operation seems at first to favour the opinion of those who hold there can be a separation of the Principles of Silver: for, say they, what is it can give this blue colour, after that the Silver hath been a long time digested with the Volatile Salt of Urine, and the spirit of Wine Alcoholized, but an inward sulphur of the Silver that Page 87 separates from it by the means of this sulphureous Liquor, and mixes with it, much after the same manner as we find these sorts of Menstruums usually dissolve the sulphur of Vegetables, Animals, and Minerals, and let alone their terrestrious and saline parts? But when we consider this Tincture a little nearer, we shall find it to be nothing but a dissolution of some part of the Silver it self, that hath been volatilized by the salt of Urine, and afterwards united with the spirit of Wine; so that if you draw off, or revive this dissolved Silver, there will remain no longer a Tincture, and this is the way for you to do it. Pour your Tincture of the Moon into a Glass Body, cover it with its head, and fit a Receiver to it, lute the junctures close, and distil in a Vaporous Bath, about half the moisture, and you'l have a Liquor as clear as spirit of Wine. Put your Cucurbit into a cool place, and leave it there two days without stirring it, you'l find little Crystals on the sides, pour off the Liquor gently, which hath now lost much of its Sky-colour. Gather your Crystals, and continue to distil and crystalize the rest of the Liquor, till you have recovered all that is in it. Mix all your Crystals, dry them, and weigh them; and if you have half an ounce of them, powder them, and mix them with six drachms of the matter I described for reviving the Calx of Silver remaining in the Matrass: put this mixture into a Crucible, and covering it with a tile, light a strong fire about it, to put the matter into fusion; then taking it off the fire, and letting it cool, break the Crucible, you'l find the Silver at the bottom, which will be fit for the same Image 62 (page 88) Operation again, when you please. Note that all the Liquor which was drawn by Distillation, is as clear as common water: wherefore I conclude that the Colour did consist in the dissolution of Silver it self, and not of its sulphurs, as some have thought. You must cut the Silver into little pieces or plates, that it may dissolve the more easily. The Salt-water must be made of an ounce and a half of Salt dissolved in a quart of water: this salt precipitates the Silver, because it engages the points of the dissolvent, and shaking them violently about makes them let go the hold they had with other bodies. I shall speak more at large concerning these kinds of Precipitations in the Remarks which I shall make upon White Precipitate, and shall then explicate the reason why Sea-salt, which is an acid does precipitate that which another acid had dissolved. I shall likewise answer the objections which have been raised on this subject. Silver may be also precipitated by means of a Copper-plate, as I have said already. It is very indifferent which way you please to Precipitate it, for it is done for no other end, but to reduce the Silver into a very fine powder, for an easier dissolution. The Precipitate of Silver made with salt, or Copper, waxes brown in the drying, and though dried in the shade, which doubtless is by reason of some small proportion of Copper that it contains. If you have dissolved an ounce of Coppel-silver, and precipitate it with Salt or Copper, you'l draw an ounce and three drachms of Precipitate well washt and dried; this augmentation does proceed Page 89 from a remainder of the points which were broken in pieces, and yet do still remain in the pores of the metal; for these pores being very small, they do but hardly let go what they have received into them. There is no need of distilling a part of the Liquor, that the Tincture may be the stronger, as some have presumed to write: for on the contrary, it causes a Crystallization, which diminishes both its colour and strength, for the reason I have given before. The effect of this Tincture for Diseases must rather be attributed to the Salt of Urine, and spirit of Wine, than to the Silver; for they are not only able to fly into the Head, and open obstructions there, but assisted with the Natural heat do open the pores of all the body, and drive out ill humours by transpiration. The portion of Silver which remains at the bottom of the Matrass being impregnated with volatile parts would fly into the Air, if it were melted alone without the addition of something else; wherefore the abovementioned matter is added to it, that being of a very fixt nature may weigh it down, and hinder it from flying away.    Diana's Tree. Take an ounce of Silver, and dissolve it in three ounces of spirit of Niter, pour your dissolution into a Matrass, wherein you shall have put eighteen or twenty ounces of water, and two ounces of Quick-silver. Your Matrass must be fill'd up Image 63 (page 90) to the neck; let it lye still upon a little round of straw in some convenient place for forty days together, during which time you'l find a Tree spread forth its branches, and little balls at the end, which represent their fruit. This Operation is of no use at all in Physick, I have here described it only to please the Curious.  Remarks. These branches do proceed from the spirit of Niter, which being incorporated with the Silver and Mercury do form divers Figures, according to the room and moisture it hath to expatiate it self in. For if you should put to it but ten or twelve ounces of water, nothing but a kind of Crystals in great confusion would be able to appear. On the contrary, if you should use too much water, nothing would then be seen besides a little precipitated powder. You must let the mixture lye still for forty days together, because the spirit of Niter being very much weakned by common water is able to work but very slowly. If the matter should happen to be removed, the figure would quickly fall into confusion, but would recover it self again, if you let it lye still long enough. This Preparation is best performed in a cool place, being properly a Crystallization. This Operation may be fitly compared with the manner of Generation and Nourishment of Plants in the Earth; for if the seed abounds with too much moisture, the spirits which serve to ferment and dilate its parts, will be rendred so weak, as Page 91 not to be able to act, and so nothing can be produced; if on the contrary there should prove too little moisture, the spirits not finding room enough to expatiate in, would either continue imprisoned or evaporate into Air, and so be ineffectual. But when there happens to be a fit proportion of water in the Earth, then the spirits gently moving about do insensibly expatiate themselves, and do rarifie and sublime along with them the substance of the seed, from whence Vegetation doth proceed. But to return unto our Operation. If you should desire to separate the Silver from the Mercury, shake the whole together, and having poured it out into an earthen Vessel, make it boil for half a quarter of an hour, then let it cool a little, till it becomes little more than lukewarm; pour upon it a quart of water by little and little, in which you have dissolved two ounces of Sea-salt, and a white Precipitate will fall down; pour off the water by Inclination, and dry the Powder. Then put it in a Retort placed in a Sand-furnace, and having fitted to it a Receiver fill'd with water, give a small fire at first, then encrease it by degrees till the Retort grows red-hot, and your Quick-silver will distil drop by drop into the water; continue the fire till nothing more will distil; let the Vessels cool; pour the water out of the Receiver, and having washt the Mercury, dry it with linnen, or the crum of bread, and keep it for use. You'l find your Silver in the Retort, which you may reduce into an Ingot, by melting it in a Crucible with a little Salt-peter in a great Circular fire.     Image 64 (page 92) CHAP. III. Of Tinn. TInn is a Metal that comes near unto Silver in colour, but differs very much, in the figure of its Pores, and in the solidity and weight. The name of the Planet Jupiter is given unto it, and it is thought to receive its particular Influence from it. It is a malleable substance, and very easie to put into Fusion. It will not all of it quite dissolve in Aqua Fortis, as some have affirmed, but some part will remain undissolved, which shews it is compounded of different parts, and that its Pores are of a different figure. A virtue hath been attributed to it against the Diseases of the Liver and Matrix, but this quality is only imaginary, experience in no wise evincing the truth of it.  Pulverization of Tinn. Tinn being of a malleable nature, cannot be reduced into a Powder after the usual ways of powdring. Therefore I'le give you a method how to do it easily enough. Melt in a Crucible what quantity of Tinn you think fit, and cast it into a round wooden box, that has been rubb'd within on all sides with a Page 93 piece of chalk, enough to whiten it, cover this box, and presently shake it about, until your Tinn is become cold, and so you'l find it converted into a gray powder. Lead may be Pulverized after the same manner.  Remarks. The wooden box must be round, because that figure is the most proper to shake a thing in; and the clefts of the box must be joyned together as close as may be; and but little of the Tinn must be put into the box at a time, that the parts may be the better able to separate and fall into a powder, by means of the motion or agitation. Indeed the thing may be done without rubbing the box with chalk, but by this means the melted Tinn is hindred from burning the box, as it otherwise would. Now though this Operation may seem to be of no great use, nevertheless it will be found to be of very good use, in order to prepare several Operations upon Tinn. For by this means it will easily mix with Salts, and other matters.    Calcination of Tinn. To Calcine Tinn is to reduce it into the form of a Calx, by the means of fire. Put Tinn into a large earthen Pan unglazed, place it in a Circular fire, the Tinn will melt. Stir it with a Spatule, until it is reduced into Powder; Image 65 (page 94) continue a great fire to it 36 hours, and stir it from time to time, then take it off the fire and let it cool, and you'l have a Calx of Tinn.  Remarks. I use an unglazed earthen vessel, because the Lead which makes the varnish might mix with the Tinn, and so hinder the purity of it; a Pan is the figure that's proper for this Calcination, for being able hereby to spread the matter about with a Spatule, its Sulphurs fly away the more easily; insomuch that Tinn may be as well Calcined in such a vessel in six and thirty hours, as in four days time in a Crucible; the stirring it does likewise serve to drive out the Sulphur.    Salt of Jupiter of Tinn. This Operation is a Tinn penetrated by acids, and reduced into the form of Salt. Take two pounds of Calcined Tinn, put it into a Matrass, and pouring upon it distilled Vinegar to the height of four fingers, set it a digesting in Sand, for two or three days, shaking the vessel from time to time; afterwards pour off the liquor by inclination, and adding more distilled Vinegar to the matter remaining, digest it as before, decant the liquor, and repeat the adding new distilled Vinegar, and digesting it, three or four times more: then Filtrate all these impregnations and evaporate them in a glass Body in Sand to the Page 95 consumption of three quarters of the liquor, let the remainder cool, and then remove the Body, without shaking it, into a Celler, or such like cold place, to lye still three or four days, and you'l find Crystals formed on the sides of the Body; separate them from the liquor, and evaporate some more of it, put that which remains into a Celler as before, and you'l find new Crystals; continue these evaporations and crystallizations; until you have drawn all your Salt of Tinn, which you must dry in the Sun, and keep in a Viol. This Salt is desiccative, when mixed in Pomatums; it may also serve for Tettars. Those who do not concern themselves to have this Salt in Crystals may evaporate all the moisture of this dissolution, over a small fire, and they will have a Salt remain to them as good as the first.  Remarks. This Salt is only compounded of the acid part of the Vinegar, incorporated into the Tinn after the resemblance of Salt, but if you should destroy these acids, the Tinn would resume its former shape. I shall shew the way of this Revivification, when I shall treat of Salt of Saturn, both being performed after the same manner. If the Calx of Tinn had not been well Calcined, and dispossest of some quantity of Sulphur, the acidity of the Vinegar would never have been able to dissolve it, because it would have been presently shockt in the supple yielding parts of Image 66 (page 96) the Sulphur without a capacity of acting; for that an acid may be capable of dissolving a body, it is requisite that the pores be fitly disposed, so that it may preserve its motion some time in which it may make its jostles. You may separate one part of the impregnation of the Calx of Tinn, and pour upon it the Oil of Tartar per deliquium, and you'l have a Magistery of Tinn, because the Oil of Tartar which is an Alkali destroys the acid which kept up the Tinn dissolved, and forces it to let go its hold; you must wash this Magistery, and dry it, it serves for the same uses as that which I shall describe hereafter, but there is but little Magistery got by this preparation. If a man would persist to Calcine the Calx remaining in the Bolt-head, and put more Vinegar to it, it would at last all dissolve, but the Operation would be too tedious.    Sublimation of Tinn. To Sublime Tinn is to raise and Volatilize it by means of a Volatile Salt. Take one part of Tinn, and two parts of Sal Armoniack in Powder: mix them well together, and put your mixture into a strong earthen Cucurbite, that is able to endure the fire, and whose two thirds at least do remain empty; fit unto it a blind Head, lute the conjunctions exactly well, and place your Vessel on the grate in a small Furnace with an open fire, but only open so as that the fire can pass through the Registers, and for Page 97 ""hat end you must stop up the top of the Furnace with Bricks and Lute"

Image 2 (unnumbered page) Unnumbered page THE PUBLISHER TO THE Reader. TO keep the Reader from being at all surpriz'd at the Date of the Title-Page, I must inform him, that a good part of the ensuing Tracts were Printed off, and in my custody, the last year; and the rest had come out with them divers moneths ago, if the Noble Author had not been hinder'd from committing them to the Press by the desire and hope of being able in a short time to send them abroad more numerous, and by his being hinder'd to do so partly by Remove, partly by the want of some Papers that were odly lost or spoil'd, and partly by the sickness of himself, and divers of his near Image 3 (unnumbered page) Relations. And some of these Impediments do yet suppress what the Author intended should have made a part of the Book, which now he suffers to be publish'd without them, though divers of his Papers about some other particular Qualities have been written so long ago, as to have lain for many years neglected among other of his old Writings: Which that he may have both leasure and health to review, and fit for publication, is the ardent wish of the sincere Lovers of Real Knowledge, who have reason to look on it as no mean proof of his constant kindness to Experimental Philosophy, that in these Tracts he perseveres in his course of freely and candidly communicating his Experiments and Observations to the publick, notwithstanding the liberty that hath been too boldly taken to mention them as their own by some later Writers; as particularly by the Compiler of the Treatise, entitul'd Polygraphice, who in two Chapters hath allow'd himself to present his Reader with alove Fifty Experiments, taken out of Unnumbered page our Authors Book of Colours, without owning any one of them to Him, or so much as naming him or his Book in either of those Chapters, nor, that I remember, in any of the others. Nor did I think this practice justified by the confession made in the Preface, importing, that the Compiler had taken the particulars he deliver'd from the Writings of others. For, this general and perfunctory acknowledgment neither doth right to particular Authors, nor, by naming them, enables the Reader to know, whether the things deliver'd come from persons fit to be credited or not: And therefore, since 'tis but too likely, that such Concealment of the Names, if not Usurpation of the Labours of the Benefactors to Philosophy, will prove much more forbidding to many others to impart their Experiments, than as yet they have to our generous Author; it seems to be the Interest of the Commonwealth of Learning openly to discountenance so discouraging a practice, and to shew, that they do not think it fit that Possessors of useful pieces of Image 4 (unnumbered page) knowledge should be strongly tempted to envy them to the Publick, to the end onely that a few Compilers should not be put upon so reasonable and easie a work, as by a few words or names to shew themselves just, if not grateful. But not to keep the Reader any longer from the perusal of these Tracts themselves, I shall conclude with intimating onely, that what our Author saith in one of them concerning the Insufficiency of the Chymical Hypothesis for explaining the Effects of Nature, is not at all intended by him to derogate from the sober Professors of Chymistry, or to discourage them from useful Chymical Operations; forasmuch as I had the satisfaction, some years since, to see in the Authors hands a Discourse of his about the Usefulness of Chymistry for the Advancement of Natural Philosophy; with which also 'tis hoped he will e're long gratifie the Publick.   Page 1 ADVERTISEMENTS Relating to the following TREATISE. TO obviate some misapprehensions that may arise concerning the ensuing Notes about Particular Qualities, it may not be improper to adde something in this place to what has been said in another See Tracts about Cosmical Qualities, &c. to which is prefixt an Introduction to the History of Particular Qualities; Printed at Oxford 1""""1. Paper in reference to those Notes, and consequently to premise to the particular Experiments some few general Advertisements about them. And I. we may consider, that there may be three differing ways of treating Historically of Particular Qualities. For either one may in a full and methodical History prosecute the Phaenomena; or one may make a Collection of various Experiments and Observations whence may be gathered divers Phaenomena to illustrate several, but not all of the Heads or Parts of such an ample or methodical History; or (in the third place) one may in a more Image 5 (page 6) confin'd way content ones self to deliver such Experiments and Observations of the Production, or the Destruction or Change of this or that Quality, as, being duly reason'd on, may suffice to shew wherein the nature of that Quality doth consist, especially in opposition to those erroneous conceits that have been entertained about it. Of the First of these three ways of treating of a Quality I pretend not to have given any compleat example; but you will find, that I have begun such Histories in my. Specimens about Fluidity and Firmness, and in the Experiments, Observations, &c. that I have put together about Cold. The Second sort of Historical Writings I have given an Instance of in my Experiments about Colours; but in these ensuing Notes, the occasion I had to make them having obliged me chiefly to have an eye to the disproval of the errours of the Peripateticks and the Chymists about them, I hope I shall not be thought to have fallen very short in my Attempt, if I have (here and there) perform'd what may be required in the Third way of writing Historically of a Quality; my present Design being chiefly to give an Intelligent and Historical Account of the Possible Mechanical Origination, not of the various Page 7 Phaenomena of the particular Qualities succinctly mentioned in these Notes; though, my secondary end being to become a Benefactor to the History of Qualities by providing Materials for my self or better Architects, I have not scrupled to adde to those, that tend more directly to discover the Nature or Essence of the Quality treated of, and to derive it from Mechanical Principles, some others (which happen'd to come in my way) that acquaint us but with some of the less luciferous Phaenomena. II. That you may not mistake what is driven at in many of the Experiments and Reasonings deliver'd or propos'd in the ensuing Notes about Particular Qualities, I must desire you to take notice with me, what it is that I pretend to offer you some proofs of. For, if I took upon me to demonstrate, that the Qualities of bodies cannot proceed from (what the Schools call) Substantial Forms, or from any other Causes but Mechanical, it might be reasonably enough expected, that my Argument should directly exclude them all. But since, in my Explications of Qualities, I pretend only, that they may be explicated by Mechanical Principles, without enquiring, whether they are explicable by any other, that which I need to prove, is, Image 6 (page 8) not that Mechanical Principles are the necessary and onely things whereby Qualities may be explained, but that probably they will be found sufficient for their explication. And since these are confessedly more manifest and more intelligible than substantial Form"" and other Scholastic Entities (if I may so call them) 'tis obvious"

Before they are used, they are to be kept in water, and the place is to be rubbed with nitre, clay, or to be scarrified, and anointed with bloud. They being first put into warm and clean water, and then cleansed, using tepid oile, that the parts may not be cold, and if they are to be fastened to the hands, or feet, they are to be thrust into the water in which they are; and if there are but few to be used, their tailes are to be cut off with a paire of cisers, for then they draw bloud, till salt, nitre, or ashes to be cast upon their mouthes, afterwards a cupping glasse is to be applied to draw out the poyson, else the part is to be fometed Image 4 (page 276) with sponges: And if the parts shall water after, manna, cumin, or meale may be sprinkled on them, applying wool afterwards with a little oile; and if the bloud shall continue still to issue out, apply lint or spiders webbs with vineger: Or burnt galls, or a new spung with tarre, binding on a paper moistened in vineger; but in the long parts, ligature may serve. Here note that leeches draw not from deepe parts, but the uppermost: And they are to be used in such bodies that feare the incisions of scarrifications, or in such parts, in which cupping glasses cannot be used, by reason of their smalnesse, gibbosity, or inequality: And leeches are to be taken away, when we think they have drawne half the quantity that is to be taken away, & the rest is to be let pass, and the part after is to be fomented and warmed, and the flux to be stopped by things astringent and emplastick. They may be applied by a reed also, & removed by hot oile put upon their mouths, they are useful against subcuraneous diseases, as ringworms, &c. And in the remission of diseases, symptoms, paine, griefe, swellings and heat, that the matter may not be more attracted, sometimes they may be applied to such parts as will not beare bloud-letting. Albuc. The best are those in sweet waters, not redd, the great headded, black, green; such causing apostumes, faintings, fluxes of bloud, feavers, laxity, and evil ulcers: Those also are bad, that live in ill waters, black, dirty, or stinking; but the best live where Froggs doe, having two lines of the colour of arsnick, round, liver coloured, and like the Mouse taile, red bellied, & green backt, if from running waters: In Germany they preferre the greater, greenish, and black spotted, Avic. They are to be kept a day before use, having what was in the squeezed out, & having a little bloud then given to the; then they are to be taken in a sponge to wipe off their viscosity, and to be put into clear water, being stung with a nettle, to cause them to vomit. They may be made to fasten, by milk, and to fall off by aloes, or vineger: and by vineger and salt, they may be made to vomit their bloud, and then the parts are to be fomented with warme water: And after the place may be stopped by lime, ashes, bole armoniack or aloes. They may be applied to most veines, as in venimous bitings, gangreens, ringworms, vices of the skinn, to the foremost and hinder part of the head in lethargies, in the melancholick epilepsy to the spleen, influxions and paines of the head to the parts behind the eares, and coronal future, in madnesse behind the eares, in rhewms of the eyes to the forehead, Alex. Ben. and to the gums in the toothach, Trot. to red places in the face. Cael. Aurel. To the neck and throat in the quinsey, to the Page 277 liver, in the hardnesse thereof, and dropsy: To the spleen for its griefes, to the loines for the satyriasis, to the hemorrhoids in the melancholy, putrid feavers, head-griefes, dyspepsy, transpiration hindred, in continual feavers; & they then may be stopped with the white of an egge and hares furre, to the ankles for the menses and inflammation, so for the gout. Marcel. Aet. Their ashes are a psilothron, and if putrified in black wine they make the haire black. Their powder given causeth mutation of feathers. If swallowed they cause a rejection of thin bloud. Diosc. If they stick to the mouth of the ventricle they may be removed by drinking of brine, the leaves of laserwort, or beets, with vineger, or snow water with oxycrate, nitre gargled with water, or shoomakers black with vineger: Or cold water held in the mouth with meale of lupines, with purges, also salt, and Sea water. Gal. Or garlick, onions, leekes, dittander, greene nep, vineger with butter; birth-wort with salt, and the suffumigation of the wall Louse, so Florent. glasses of water applied to the mouth, the meale of gum dragant ashes, or wormwood blowed in, or with instruments. If in the nostrils use errhines and purgers, the same serve for brutes, especially rue with vineger. Absyrtus used hot oile with wine. The Crocodile useth the bird Trochilus. Rond. The leech of the Sea boiled in old oile helps the paines of the eares, with that of almonds or chamomile it helps the paine of the hemorrhoids, in wine it helps wounds of the nerves, it helps convulsions, and the alopecia burnt with vineger: Jonst. They are generated of putrid matter, & they appeare in May; when they fasten on the body they leave not off, till they are full, except pulled to pieces. They move by the taile and mouth. If put into a cane they goe out backwards, and through a very narrow passage.   Locust. Locusta.  P. They live in Russia, Syria, and Italy. M. Of herbs, corne, and flowers. N.  in non-Latin alphabet 	. Arab. Gierat.  in non-Latin alphabet 	 Diosc.  Locust. Aldrov. T. Many did use them for food. V. Diosc. Their suffumigation helps the difficulty of urine, especially in Women, so Image 5 (page 278) Plin. and Avic. The same helps the hemorrhoids, their dung helps the panus and morphew, their feet help warts, Plin. and the leprosy with Goats dung, and expell the stone. Avic. Twelve graines of their eggs, with a little dry myrtle, drunk, help the dropsy. Rhas. Given without leggs in wine they help against all venimous bitings. Diosc. That without wings drunk in wine, helps the bitings of Scorpions; some say, that worne about the neck, they help quartans. Gaudent. Mer. And if they swimme in wine they shew its not adulterated, so Gras-hoppers. Jonst. They ware eaten formerly, by the Ethiopians, Africans, Syrians, Persians, Arabians, and Lybians, and now in the East and West Indies, as also by John the Baptist. Albert. As for the description, their head is like a horses, and they have six feet, they are generated of putrefaction in a dry time, and by coiture. Their fume is an amulet.   Louse. Pediculus.  P. Their place is sufficiently known, to every one. M. They live of flesh and bloud, and the like. N.  in non-Latin alphabet 	. Pedunculus. Gall. Poulx. Hisp. Peojo.  Louse. Schrod. T. V. They are eaten by rusticks to help the jaundise, and atrophy; put into the meatus they provoke urine, provoking the expulsive faculty. Some put them into the eyes, to eate off wefts. Jonst. If breeding in the heads of those that have been long sick, they prognosticate health. They are begotten of hot and moist matter, especially pituitous bloud; for the bilious and melancholick killeth them, so gall applied; and chiefely about the emunctories they are produced. They often arise from the eating of basil, chestnuts, figgs, radishes, parsley, dates, and fume of the wood of aloes. The remedies against them, Diosc. are garlick boiled with organy, or coriander, Plin. So the seeds of staphic agria, mustard, garlick with vineger and nitre, and radish oile, using them outwardly: So the slough of Serpents, seed of tamarisks, and water of radish leaves, inwardly. Also barbery leaves, and quicksilver and oile of roses, worn on a girdly about the belly.    Page 279 M.  Moth. Blatta.  P. They live almost every where, chiefely in mills. M.

In oile they help the eares. The soft boiled in oile help warts. Those living about mills, having their heads pulled off, help the leprosy. Diosc. Those in bake houses, stamped with oile help the paines of the eares. The stinking sort with pisselaeum, help uncurable ulcers, botches, also eating ulcers, scabs and whitlows: Diod. Also the jaundise, and orthopnoea with rosin, and honey; applyed they draw things out that are fixed in the body. They may be gathered together by moth-mullen. They may be kept from bee-hives by sharp sumes, and setting a candle neere them in the evening: they may be kept from bookes, they being irrigated with sharp alum, or nitre. garments are defended from them by lavender flowers, or rosemary, mints, wormwoood, staechas, and watergermander, Jonst. also by oile of spike. They help against deafeness and paine of the eares: With old wine, honey, pomegranat pills, apples, tarre, and onion juyce.    O.  Oxeflie. Tabanus.  P.

Pliny saith that the worms of which they are generated worn help against feavers, and they were used for the same purpose by the Magitians. Jonst. As for their Image 6 (page 280) description, their body is long, divided chiefely into three parts, they are of a blackish colour, with six black feet, in other things they are like the Cynomyia.    P.  Pismire. Formica.  P. Almost every where, in England and other places. M. Of fruits, seedes, and Serpents. N.  in non-Latin alphabet 	. Murmos. Frugilegae. Gall. Formie. Hisp. Hormiga.  PIsmire. Aldrov. T. In some places in the Indies they eate them with pepper; but they are rather to be abominated in this respect. V. Plin. The greater and winged stamped with a little salt, help the psora, leprosy, and red pimples. Some say that five drunk help all bitings of field Spiders. Those that have wings taken in oile of elder, and applied to the genital, cause strength in venery; the same are used in the Booke of secrets attributed to Gallen. Plin. Beares eate them against the hurts of Mandrakes, and nauseousnesse. Plin. Their eggs help dulnesse of hearing: Stamped with flies they make black the eyebrows. Rubbed on the cheekes of Boyes, they keepe them from roughnesse. Arnold. Vil. unc. 2. of their eggs, with the juyce of henbane, and batt's bloud cradicate haire, if used twice or thrice in a day. Nightingals use them as physick, when they are sick. Plin. The ant-hils applied help botches, and gouts, &c. Schrod. The best are those that live under resiniferous trees. T. They are hot, dry and cause venery. V. Their acid smell doth much cherish the vital spirits. Their hills heate and dry, and strengthen the nerves: therefore they help the palsey, hysterical passions, and the cachexy. The oile of their infusion causeth coiture: the liquour made of them in an oven, is a good ophthalmick remedy, helping the suffusion of the eyes. They generate pustuls by biting, and their eggs drunk cause flatulency and paine of the belly. They may be driven away by bitumen, sulphur, and tithymal; so Jonst. The destilled water of them causeth vomiting, Gesn. and helpeth fevers. A bath made of them expels the stone. Brunfels. applied with salt, eggs, and axunge, laying a cloth Page 281 betwixt they help the sciatica, Marcel. they help the itch; Albert. and dissipate flatulencies. Non. They helpe cornes and tumours. Their description is needlesse. They generate in the winter, bringing forth little worms, which turne inte egges, which then bring forth in spring; when old they grow winged, and live not long after it. they live like a common wealth, & get corne, which they dry, and bite at both ends, that it grow not. They ware stones by their assiduity, and make beaten paths; and bury their dead, damm out water, and help one an other in the drawing of their burdens, Aet. The greater lead, and the lesser evaginate the corne, if dirty they cleanse themselves before they enter into their places. They teach the young to labour, the idle they expel, & when they carry in their graine it's a signe of soule weather. They cast up the earth over their dores, that the water may not enter in. They have three cells, in one they live, breed in the second and bury there, and keepe corn in the third.    S.  Scolopender. Scolopendra.  P. Their habitation is, in the bodies of trees. M. They live about the trunks of trees. N.  in non-Latin alphabet 	. Porcus lutosus. Multipeda.  SColopender. Aldrov. T. V. Their poyson causeth putrefaction. Diosc. The symptoms after their biting is bluenesse about the wound, putrefaction, and there's an itch over all the body. The remedy is salt finely powdered, with vineger, or wild rue applied. The place is to be fomented with brine, drinking birthwort in wine, wild time, or wild rue; also the seed and flowers of asphodil drunk in wine, Plin. Also the leaves of horsmint drach. 2. being drunk in wine, and mints, maiden haire, wild pennyroyall with salt, wild cumin, vineger drunk, childrens urine, salt drunk in vineger, the ashes of the Sea Crabb, and barley meale; but some of the Ancients preferre ashes kneaded with vineger, and penny royal, rue, and mints, drunk in wine. Jonst. Boiled Image 7 (page 282) in oile they take away haire. Their bitings are to be scarified. Muff. They differ as to their description, from the Gally-worm; as the Lobster from the Crevise.

So the ashes, gr. 6. being taken with the syrup of rootes, so the water injected by a Catheter, with the seed of Macedonian stoneparsly, with the tecolite, or stones of Crabs, so Card. Mes. So the oile used to the reines & privy parts, some adde the oile of bitter almonds, or round birthwort, gentian, galingal, and bark of the roots of capers. Sylv. It's used in remedies against poyson; and with spices it opens, incideth, maketh thin, cleanseth, and breaketh open, and breaketh the stone specifically. Varig. Some by the unction of the oile have been freed from quotidian feavers. That of Matthiolus, used to the pulsatile veines, as in the temples, hands, feet, and region of the heart, repeted thrice in an houre, frees from all poysons, within the body, that corrode not, also from the bitings of Vipers, aspes, or any venimous beasts, also it cureth and preserveth from the plague: It killeth all inward worms, and helpeth all paines of flatulency, or cold, especially of the ventricle, the confection of Damascen, also breaketh the stone. Gal. The Scorpion helps those that are bitten by the Viper. Plin. Stamped they help the poyson of the Stellion. Stamped and taken with mulse, they help the jaundice, also often applied with rose vineger they help the gout, and inflammations. Aldrovand reporteth also other uses hereof, which are superstitious. Schrod. They provoke urine; their infusion in oile of bitter almonds, drunk, helps the collick and stone: The compounded of Mesue, helps the paines of the reines also, venimous bitings, paroxysmes in feavers used to the back, and helps paines of the eares. Pon. Their sanguine oile, mightily helps nephritick paines used Page 283 outwardly. So, Kief. Jonst. As for their description, they are of a soutish colour, oval forme, with little eyes, eight feet, & two arms. They touch only the pilous parts. Whe they goe they goe trasversly. They love the shade, they sting not if not trod on, they seeme friends by their head, whe they strike with their taile; & in Aethiopia those that tread on their excrements, have exulcerated feet. Their poyson is very troublesome, and is worst at midde day & in summer, and its counted incurable after the eating of basil. The symptomes are inflammation, hardnesse, rednesse, and paine of the part, inequal temper, sweat, trembling, swellings in the groin, flatulency of the belly, and distorsion of the face, &c. The remedies are worm-wood, sowthernwood drunk in wine, amomum, bishopsweed, aniseed, garlick, birth wort, asphodil, assa foetida, atriplex, blites, marigold, calamint, centaury, ground ivy, coloquintida, cyperus, galbanum, barley and flowerdeluce: Balsam, myrtle, rose, bramble, bayes, frankincense & vine.

Applied they help the wounds of the Sea-Dragon, and Scorpions, also against all poysons, drunk, by byting, or blow, being drunk in broth. Veget. The fume helps against pestilent diseases, so Myrepsus useth them Image 8 (page 284) with other things. Turnebus useth them as a psilothron with scolopenders, nettles, and nitre. Rond. With restharrow it helps the rupture of the peritonaeum, so Jonst. As for the description, they voide their excrements by their mouth, and have a hard skinne: they wander about the Sea as the polypus, and they presently digest their meat, being of a fiery nature.   Silk-worme. Bombax.  P. They are in the Indies, and other places. M. Of mylberry and elme leaves. N.  in non-Latin alphabet 	. Vermis laniferus, Schrod. Ser.  Silk-worme. Aldrov. T. They feed birds fatt, and make fields fertile: the German souldiers did sometimes frie and eate them. The silk is temperate, and strengthneth the heart, therefore it's used in the diamoschum, confection of alchermes, and cordial powders when crude: Serap. It's to be cutt into small parts with a paire of scizers, then tosted at the fire. Hal. Or its to be baked in an oven. Vincent. If burnt it mundifieth wounds, strengthneth, and and cleanseth the teeth with salt; in wounds of the head applied to the dura mater, it strengthens the braine, and preventeth putrefaction, especialy the dyed.

Therefore they are often used Page 285 inwardly against the cough, phthisick, spitting of bloud, and other affections of the lungs, also against heate of the liver, and collick paines. Used outwardly they ripen and break the anthrax. Applied alone or with the gall of a Bull, they consolidate wounds, especially of the nerves; & they cure ulcers, chiefely of the leggs. They ease podagrick inflammations, & the belly of the hydropical, & they make the hernious hydrocele to fall; applied to the forehead they help the hemorrhage. Their spume helps fistula's. Their shells powdered help the stone, and dry and consolidate clefts in the hands. Their fatt swimming on broth when cold, helps rednesse of the eyes, and paines; and applied to the forehead with the white of an egge, it stopps defluxions to the eyes. Their salivous mucus which they vomit out when pricked, is emplastick, therefore it gleweth, and intercepts defluxions to the eyes in frontalls. Their water distilled in May or October, helps such as are atrophick, it strengthning the liver: used outwardly it serves as a fucus for the face. Their ashes dry, incrassat, and help chaps and roughnesse. S. Closs. Their liquour with salt helps paines of the gout, and helps warts after scarrification.

Used inwardly to provoke urine, gr. 3. or 4. may suffice with such remedies as may correct their poyson, and outwardly with such things as may mitigate their acrimony. H. They are not to be given to those that have incurable diseases; or a scirrhus of the bowels. Those that are hot beare the use of them worse, than those that are cold: and the weake than the strong. Some cast away the feet, and head, others the head and body. Hippocrates rejected the head, feet, and wings, using them in a potion against the dropsy, sc. 3. in water; but Galen used them whole, some count their wings alexitery. If taken Image 9 (page 286) whole they draw out heate, ulcerate and corrode. They are used to maturate and open ulcers. Their powder with Goats bloud, or mastick taken in wine helps swellings of the body, used fasting; Diosc. And the dropsy, so applied also. Their powder made by adustion, with the gumme of cherry trees, to make it more wholsome, is used in diuretick electuaries, and apozems. Applied to the arme and shoulders, they strongly provoke urine. Plin. Applied to tetters with the juyce of grapes of the wild vine, and fatt of a sheep or Goat, they cure the same: Applied with tarre they help the alopecia, the skinn being prepared with nitre, and they not being suffered to ulcerate deepe, applying the heads of Mice with their galls, and dung, with hellebore and pepper. Galen also useth them in his fifth booke de comp. med. secundum loc. for the same purpose, and the leprosy. Plin. Used with the wild vine they help warts, and draw out things fixed in the body with barley meale. Gal. Used in cerots and plaisters they draw off scabbed nailes, Plin. They help the gout. They are now used in phoenigms in like diseases and paines of the joynts, and humours sticking in parts, which cannot be resolved by emollients, attenuants, discutients, or attrahents: being finely beaten and applied, or made into a cerot: Or one part thereof, with three of stamped mustard-seed, and six of the pulp of figgs, and sharp leven: Blisters also may be drawn, with black sope, and common salt. an. made into a plaister, which being opened, and some fart or lenient remedy applied, the exulceration will not be dryed, till all the humour is drawn out of the part affected; thus may humours be drawn out, that are deeply setled in the body, and great paines eased. They also helpe white pustuls of the face applied with vineger, the itch, wild scabb, and running sores, also cancers boiled with oile to the thicknesse of honey, it then mollifying, ripening and opening ulcers. Hippocrates used them to eate flesh in ulcers. They provoke urine and the menses, therefore he used them in many diseases of Women that arised from obstructions, as to open the womb, cause conception, in the strangling of the womb, paines, mother, secundine, and other inward griefes, as the jaundice, &c. l. de nat. Mul. de steril. de morb. mul. de intern. aff. Gal. Stamped and drunk with the root of the white vine, they kill worms, Matth. Taken they help bitings of a mad Dogg.

Three or foure drunk help those that are bitten by the Phalangium. They help cornes in the feet. Their harmes may be seen in Parey, l. 20. c. 28. C. The best are those that have luteous lines in their wings: Fatt, little, broad, and pilous: Found amongst corne. They may be killed by drowning in vineger, and then kept in a pot. They serve as meate to Vipers. Schrod. They are corrosive, and therefore they are used in vesicatory plaisters. They are very hurtfull to the bladder, in so much that used outwardly they exulcerate it. They are used by some to destroy the foetus and as a philtron. Galen used their wings and feet as an antidote against their poyson; but now the wings; feet, and heads are throwne away, and the body only used. Their oile drawn by the spirit of wine is lithontriptick. Jonst. They are to be used very warily in physick; they are poysonsome if taken in a great quantity, and cause paine in the bowells from the mouth to the privities; they exulcerate the bladder, and inflame the next parts: they cause pissing of bloud and flesh, often the diarrhaea, dysentery, syncope, and alienation of minde, and in the mouth the taste of pitch is perceived. The remedy is milk of Women, Goats, or Cows, taken every houre, and clysters with fatt broth, and emollient oiles, oile of lillies, and almonds fresh, taken in a sorbile egge, oile of dropwort, and purslain. Also oile of quinces, vineger of squills, earth of Samos and the Armenian, triacle and mithridate with things that refrigerate, resist erosion, and ease paine, with vomiting. Aldrov. They also cause nauseousnesse, and the vertigo, and ill taste in the mouth, by reason of vaporous humours in the stomach and liver adust by intense heate, and so the right side is most troubled. The remedy after vomiting is oile, or the decoction of the head of a Goat, Hogg, or Lamb, boiled with line seed; also fatt broths largly taken, using the proritation of the finger after it: And clysters of milk: Also crude and fresh butter. Diosc. Clysters of rice, barley, mallows, lineseed, fenigreek, or roots of marsh mallows, taking nitre with hydromel: Wine with pine kernels, seeds of cucumbers, mulse, or Goose fatt. Cels. Alheale with milk, or galbanum Matth. The seed of fleabane, quinces, and mallows. The syrrupe of water lilly-flowers, and violets: Also of poppies, lettuce, purslain, the juyce of cucumbers, the cremor of the seed of lettuce, poppies, cucumbers and citruls, with the water of violets, and winter Image 10 (page 288) cherries, purslain, oile of white poppies. Baths of marsh-mallows and gourds. And for the dysentery fatt broths, oile omphacine, roses, with plantain water in clysters. For inflamed parts, barly meale with mulse at last: Eating the flesh of Hens, Kids, Pigs, that are fatt, with lineseed, & drinking muste: And using the Electuary of Matthiolus and Dioscorides, Merul. They may be driven away by the fume of Cows dung and galbanum. Their description is needlesse, they are bred of humidity by exsiccation on leaves, of ashes, or the white rose, &c.

Boiled in oile of roses and put into the eares it helps quartans. So Plin. The long and white having slender feet, if stamped in old oile olive, help white spots in the eyes; so with oile, or used alone in wool, or with saffron. Plin. That called Lycos helps spitting of bloud. Some count that those carried in a box cause foecundity. Pliny useth the cobwebs of the flie spiders to cure the epiphora. Gal. Their webbs help cutaneous wounds and ulcers, as upon cutts by knives; but the white and pure doth constipate and coole: put upon fresh wounds it keepeth them from sa""ies and cleanseth fresh spotts. Diosc. Plin. It helps inflammation"

IT was the saying of the wisest among men, (high & mighty Prince) In the multitude of people is the Kings honor, but in the want of people is the destruction of a Prince. And for this cause as well the Law of God, as the constitutions of men haue hembd in the furious affections of vnruly and disorderly persons, lest to the detriment and danger of their neighbour, they should runne at randome beyond the rules of reason, in murthering and massacring him whom the Almighty had made according to his owne image and holinesse. Now as there is no crime so enormious, but it may be masqued with the mantle of Image 3 (unnumbered page) some vertue: so is there a sort of people who purchasing to themselues credit, with the too-too credulous multitude, doe vnder a plausible pretence of health, not onely sucke the substance from the deluded multitude, but often precipitate their bodies into Charons boat. Of whom a learned late Writer said well, that these people were more pernitious to a Common-wealth, then the common cut-throats by the high-way sides. All which offenders are not a little encouraged, by the ordinary inspection of vrines, as it is at this day not without great preiudice to the publique, euery where practised. Amongst many who haue stood in the gap against this abuse, none hath handled this subiect more plainly and to better purpose, then this present Author, whom for this cause I haue of a stranger vndertaken to make a Free-denizon, and to speake the language of this Land. As for my selfe, silence had beene more secure, and more safe for me to haue kept within the harbor, then to launce out into the deep and tempestuous Sea of mens censorious humours. But all the barkings and snarlings of the most enuious Momes & Zoiles being weighed in the scales against the publique good, will bee found too light, being especially shrowded vnder the wings of so mighty a Maecoenas as your selfe. Neyther is it any new thing that great Princes haue beene affectioned fauourers of Physicke, and Physitians. Hence haue we the name of Mithridates daign'd vnto a noble Physicall compounded Unnumbered page Antidote: of Gentius the Illyrian king to the hearb Gentian: of Lysimachus to the hearb Lysimachia, &c But that I may come yet a little neerer, it is recorded that one of your Highnesse Ancestors, and sometimes King in the Northerne part of this Iland, composed certaine physicall Canons. And another King of the same descent is recorded to haue attained to that skill in curing of wounds (a branch of Surgery, being it selfe one of the parts of Physicke) that many noble Families of that Kingdome hauing from him acquired this skill, haue with their inheritances transmitted the same to their Successors. But hath not our bright morning starre, the purchaser of our peace, of whom your Highnes hath his being, and on whom the eyes of the European Princes are now set, as in other Arts and liberall Sciences, so likewise in this Profession, manifested so profound knowledge, as one would thinke the oracle of Aesculapius had beene committed to his custody? And as the great Commander of this Vniuerse hath singled you out for a Successor to so great Countries and Kingdomes; so doe I not doubt but he will make you such a patterne of pietie, and endue you with so noble and heroicall vertues, fit for so high and mighty a calling, as the after-ages shall haue cause to blesse the memory of your name. And if names (howsoeuer of no validity in themselues) doe yet often call to minde the noble vertues and heroicall exploits of our Predecessors, and incite vs to a laudable imitation of the same: of what name shall we finde more magnanimous and Image 4 (unnumbered page) couragious Champions, and better acquainted with the affaires of Mars and Minerua? Amongst many I will single out but three, which shall serue in stead of many moe. The noble and heroicall exploits of that euer-renowned worthy Champion Charles Martell deseruing eternall memory, the famous Tours can yet testifie; whereas aboue three hundred and seuenty thousand of the miscreant Saracenicall nation, did affright not onely France, but euen Italy it selfe, and the Pope notwithstanding his triple Crowne, with all his Clergy, was not a little amazed; and yet were by this valiant Champion vtterly ouerthrown, leauing their dead carkeises for a testimonie of his triumphant victory. It would be too tedious to relate the rest of his heroicall acts and exploits, as well against the fore-named Nation, as many others also. But if I should enter vpon the acts of him who descended lineally out of his loynes in the second generation, that noble Charles, called, and that not without cause, Great, as he was not in word but in very deed also, I scarce should know where to beginne. And howbeit his famous acts against the Saxons and Saracens, and sundry other nations, together with the managing of the Westerne Empire, were great and glorious: yet were they farre inferiour to his other acts in planting and propagating true pietie; witnesse the foundation of so many Churches and religious places, with rents and reuennues alotted for the maintaining of the seruice of the Almighty. So farre did this magnanimous Unnumbered page Monarch differ from the iudgement of the ascrilegious Church-robbing Great-men of our dayes. What shall I say of his singular loue to letters and learned men? witnesse the founding of the two famous Vniuersities of Paris and Pauie. As for his religious life in priuate, his constant and carefull performance of the duties of pietie, they are but seldome to be seene in Princes of that eminency and might. So that of him I may iustly say that he deserueth to be paralleld with the greatest Princes, and to be enrolled among the Worthies of the world. Another great and mighty Charles the Christian world hath of later dayes produced: I meane that famous Emperour, the fift of that name, the glory of the Austrian House. Whose valiant exploits against both Christians and Infidels, together with the captiuating of the French King had made his name and fame immortall: if hee had not too basely abandoned himselfe to the performance of the will and pleasure of the Pope and his Shauelings, especially those lawlesse Locusts, I meane the Loiolites, the Pharisies of our age, and in blind zeale bathed his Blade in the blood of his most faithfull and trusty Subiects: whom therefore God suffered to be pursued by his owne Subiect Maurice Duke of Saxony, by whom also hee was forced to yeeld to such conditions as did much offuscate the splendor of his former victories. And would to God that great Henry of France of famous memory, hauing taken warning by the attempt which lighted on his teeth, and not being Image 5 (unnumbered page) circumuented by the soft and woolly words of that cunning Coton, had not suffered those infernall Furies euer to take footing any more in that famous Kingdome of France, then perhaps, had wee not had these fires of dissention kindled, nor heard that one Subiect should vnsheath his sword to bath it in his Christian brothers blood. And I hope that the Princes and Potentates of the Christian world will now learne to be wise, and to bee warned by other mens harmes. But to our Charles againe, I thinke it may well bee said of him as of Dauids Worthies, that he was honourable among many, yet attained not to the former two. But one thing yet worthy remembrance in this worthy Prince I cannot passe by; that when as that scarlet Whore, by her fawning and flattering demeanor, had drawne the affections of this Prince towards her, & according to her accustomed changeablenesse and mutability (especially when greater gaine is offered) shewing him a tricke of her old trade, in entertaining another louer: this generous Prince not able to digest so hainous iniuries, did captiuate the triple Crowne, sacking the seat and City of this abominable Beast, and discharging the Papall authority through all the Spanish Dominions, left worthy president to all posterity, that the Kingdome of Spaine, as well as her neighbour Nations, could make a pretty shift without the Papall power. In these three Worthies all manner of morall vertues, as also whatsoeuer concerneth either military or Martiall discipline, together with the Unnumbered page practices of piety and peace are liuely pourtraied and painted forth vnto vs. And our vndoubted hopes & presages of your Highnesse are such, that one day the very extract and quintessence of such heroicall vertues shall plainly bee seene to haue taken vp their seat and habitation in your selfe; the ripe fruit whereof shall be reaped not by this Iland only, but by the whole Christian world, when God in his owne appointed time shall call you to sway the Scepter of these hereditary Kingdomes. Now your Highnesse accustomed clemency and courteous entertainment of learning with the labours of the learned, haue emboldned me, howbeit the meanest among many more able and sufficient then my selfe, to present vnto your Highnesse these my rude labours; the which not my selfe alone, but many more of refined iudgement, haue thought fit to publish for the good of the publique. Let it therefore please your Princely patience to accept of this first part of the first fruits of my labours, vntill the second part may see the light of the Sunne, which likewise longeth for, and relieth vpon the patronage of so great a Prince; beseeching your Highnesse to accept of it, not according to the worth, but the will and good affection of him who doth present it. Thus did our gracious God in the building of the Tabernacle, accept as well of Goats haire and Badgers skinnes, as of siluer, and gold, and precious stones, scarlet, purple, blew, and fine linnen. And the poore Widowes mite was accepted of according to the bountifulnesse Image 6 (unnumbered page) of her mind. The mighty Monarch Artaxerxes also accepted kindly at the hand of Sinetas the Persian his entertainment with a cup of cold water taken out of the Riuer Cyrus. Now being conscious to my selfe, that my good and forward affection is nothing inferior, hauing no better gift for the present, I hope this my paines shall find no worse entertainment at your Highnesse hands. And thus shall I pray for your Highnesse happy and prosperous estate; with the abundance of all good things in this life, and endlesse happinesse in the life to come: and shall euer remaine Your Highnesses most humble, affectionate and dutifull seruant, for euer to be commanded, I. HART.   Unnumbered page To the courteous READER, GEntle Reader, if euer errors in any Art proued pernicious, I thinke none of meane capacity will deny that in the faculty of Physicke they are not of the least annoyance. Amongst many others, the abuses committed in the iudgement of diseases by the inspection of the vrine onely, haue beene so great and so many, that for the subduing of the same is required the helpe of some mighty Hercules. Amongst diuers others who haue opposed themselues against the sayd errors and abuses, none haue more fully, and more pertinently handled this subiect then this our Author. And because the vulgar sort of people is most subiect to be ensnared, and most obuious to euery error, my chiefe ayme and end therefore hath beene, as much as in me lyeth, to free them from imposture and cozenage, by communicating to them this Treatise in our owne vulgar tongue. It cannot indeed be denied that vrines haue for many yeares beene most basely abused. If I should say that in this Kingdome this abuse hath not a little beene improued, I thinke I should say nothing besides the truth. Witnesse so many ignorant Empirickes, women-physitians, with a many of our saucy Surgeons, and many moe, who by their pretended and supposed skill in the Image 7 (unnumbered page) 1 page duplicate	 Unnumbered page 1 page duplicate	 Image 8 (unnumbered page) inspection of vrines, doe assume vnto themselues a lawlesse liberty of encroaching vpon that profession wherein they were neuer instructed nor trained vp. But at this I doe not so much maruell, but rather to see some of the Tribe of Leui, who should sound out with their voyces like Trumpets against all sinnes, to be themselues inuolued in this sinne of Couetousnesse. For whatsoeuer other pretence they make, it may plainly appeare, that it is nothing else but a ""arment of figge leaues which will neuer couer their nakednesse.

Image 2 (unnumbered page) Unnumbered page TO THE Most Serene and Mighty MONARCH, WILLIAM III. King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland. Great SIR, I Bring to Your Majesty a small Work, a Series of Prescriptions in the Medical Art, yet possibly the Greatest in its Kind, for Excellency and �sefulness, that ever any Age produced: A Collected Summary of the Choicest Secrets in Physick yet known; and what all the Professors thereof acknowledge as a Spontaneous Product from the �niversal Stock of Experience. I have Accomodated it for the Advantage of all Your Majesty's Subjects, and made its �se as �niversal and Easie, as the Medicaments themselves are General Image 3 (unnumbered page)and Good: Had not the Necessity of such a Work, prevailed with me, I had never put my Hand to this Plough, nor troubled Your Majesty on such an Occasion. Be pleased therefore, Sir, to cast Your Favourable Eye, on the State of the Profession of Physick, and in particular on this Book, which thro' your Benignity cannot go without its hoped for Effects; for that thro' Your Royal Favour, it will not only live now in Estimation and Respect, but stand as a Signal to future Times of Your Majesty's extraordinary Goodness, frustrating the Designs of evil Men. You have, Sir, rescued us not only from the Jaws of Lions and Paws of Bears, the brutest of Beasts, but from the Insuperable Chains of Popery and Slavery, and from the Dreaded Tyranny of Eternal Slaves, the Barbarous French: And restored our dearest Liberties, ravisht from us by �surpation and Violence, thro' the Malice and Deceit of Treacherous and Ambitious Men; who not only ruin'd the Publick by their Follies, but Unnumbered pageprecipitated themselves from the highest Acme of Glory, to the fathomless Abyss of Dishonour and Contempt. Thus, Sir, becoming the Glory of the Diadem, and the Majesty of Crowned Heads, You will out-do Royalty it self; and by Your Magnanimity, build such Monuments of Honour, which the Result of utmost Ages shall never deface, nor eternal Times ever wear out or alter. Were my Abilities to write your Character but equal to the Greatness of Your Spirit; and could I but scetch out a faint Idea of Your Glorious Actions, I'd write in Everlasting Lines Your Immortal Life, and depict upon the Curtains of Eternity, not the Shadows of Royalty but the perpetual Substance thereof, powerfully Arm'd with unlimited Goodness: A Prerogative that no Prince upon Earth, but Your Majesty, can justly Claim. May Heaven therefore continue the Success of your Arms; and Victory attend You wheresoever You go: May you subdue Tyrants by Your Sword, and vanquish the Image 4 (unnumbered page)Terrible of the Earth, trampling under Your Feet the Destroyers of the World: and being filled with the Spoils of Your Enemies, May You lift up the Standarts of Justice and Truth, and by Your �nresistable Power introduce Peace to your People And that a Prosperous Conduct may attend You with Honour and Glory, thro' a long and happy Reign, is the perpetual Prayer of Your Majesty's most Loyal And humble Subject, WILLIAM SALMON.   Unnumbered page THE PREFACE. I THE Original Author of this Book was the Eminent and Learned Dr. Bate, a Man who in his Station had been Physician to Two Kings of England, and a Protector; and of such Approved Skill in his Profession, that to make any Descants thereon, would be to draw a Vail over his Lustre, and blemish that Excellency, which in this following Work, gives a convincing Proof, that he was one of the greatest Masters of his Art in the Universe. II. His Arcana and Prescripts were Collected, as they appear in the Latin Copy, by that ingenious and indefatigable Gentlemen, Mr. James Shipton, who had the Happiness of preparing and making the greater part (if not all) of them up: And by whose Care and Industry the World became blest with such a valuable Production; which exceeds in its Benefit and Usefulness to Mankind, (we speak it without Flattery) all the Dispensatories this day extant, in what Language soever. III. Thus came out the first Edition, with general Applause, which meriting so well in the World, Mr. Shipton was pleased to make us happy with a Second, wherein he added above One hundred more of Dr. Bate's Recipes, and the Arcana Goddardiana, from the Authors Autograph, who being a Learned Man, and they no mean things, advanced very much the Value of the Book: So that in a very few Years, there were sold of the Latin Copies to the number of (at least) Six thousand. IV. The Work obtaining thus exceedingly upon the Publick, as having the general Liking and Approbation of all the Learned World, more especially of the Gentlemen Image 5 (unnumbered page)of the Profession: And among the number of the rest, falling into my Hands, upon view thereof, finding it so vastly to exceed in Usefulness and Learning whatever had been yet extant of that kind before; and that it was entertained among Professors of Our Art (of what Quality or Education soever) with no common Friendship or Reception: It made me consider it a little farther; and to draw an Argument from its general Usefulness and Entertainment; That if whilst it wandred thro' the World in an unknown Tongue (as to the Vulgar) and was a Stranger, it became so desirable and acceptable; how much more, if we indulg'd it, by making it a Free Denizon, or Native of our own. V. Upon these Considerations, I immediately fell upon the Translation, which I hope you will find done with all Faithfulness and Sincerity: And whereas the Arcana Godd. were for the most part Nominal, without exhibiting their Preparations: We have in this English Edition, added them at large, and intersperst them for the Benefit of all the Lovers of this kind of Learning. VI. And whilst we were doing this, that we might yet lay a farther Obligation upon the Generous Lovers of Art; we have added to this Impression, the much esteemed Goddard s Drops, and Russel's Pouder (neither of them in any printed Work before) the former of which was one of the accounted inestimable Jewels of K. Charles II. The other that Fam'd �niversal, which for these twenty five Years last past has obtain'd a general Reputation, from the East to the West-Indies, and in a manner thro' the whole World. You have also the Emplastrum Febrifugum, which, tho' as to its Composition, it is a very simple thing, and whilst not published, hugg'd as a great Secret, yet truly valuable as to its Vertues, for that it has scarcely been ever known to be applied without the desired Success; nor did I ever use it in vain. And to these we have added near half an hundred more, of considerable Recipes, out of the Collectanea Chymica, and other valuable Authors. VII. We have not here given you a bare Translation only, but besides that, a large Comment upon each particular (as the Nature of the Subject would admit, or did require) more especially upon all the Chymical Processes, which Unnumbered pageare many, and the most excellent, selected out of a large Farraginous heap; and made choice of from mighty Strength of Reason, and a long Series of Experiences, which has exceedingly added to their Credit and Reputation. VIII. These We have almost every where searcht out, from their Original Fountains, and where need required, given a clear Explication of the Process it self, and added as a Supplement (to make the Work the more absolute and compleat) a Rationale upon the same. And farther, We have examin'd the Prescripts and Opinions of the most Learned Authors who have wrote thereof: Shewing, either their Processes at large, if new; Or, the particular Circumstances wherein they chiefly differ, if material; and so representing as it were in a Glass, a Summary of all that has been hitherto written of this kind. IX. As to the Authors made use of in this Book; tho' we cannot have the Vanity to obtrude a vast Catalogue or Heap, as is usual with several Writers of Books (possibly many whom they never lookt into, to consult, but for Ostentation they enumerate) yet we think it necessary to give an Account of the Chief of those We were Beholden to, that we may put Our Artist into a Capacity to make a more exact and satisfactory Judgment of the following Discourses. X. The Chief of those We consulted in this Undertaking were either of the more Ancient; as, Paracelsus, Crollius, Hartman, Libavius, Beguinus, Sala, Faber, Mynsicht, Grulingius, �ntzer, Quercetan, Mylius, Sennertus, &c. Or of the Modern and more Late; as, Riverius, Schroder, Hofman, Horstius, Rolfincius, Marggrave, Maets, Le Mort, Ludovicus, Ettmuller, Junken, Tachenius, Glauber, Le Febure, Thibaut, Charras, and Lemery, with some others of lesser Note, whose Performances in this kind (for so much as they wrote of) have been admirable above all the rest of their Fellows. XI. This being thus compleated, you may in a little time expect the Second Part of the same, which is now in in the Press, viz. Our Officina Chymica, or Chymical Shop; being a compleat Body of Chymistry in all in its Parts: Wherein Image 6 (unnumbered page)you will find Explicated, 1. The Principles of Natural Bodies, in their received and genuine Sense. 2. The Fornaces and Instruments of the Art particularly described with their Figures in Copper Plates. 3. The Operations of Chymistry per se, abstracted from the Preparation of any set Medicine. 4. The Preparation of Metals and Minerals deduced from all the Operations of Chymistry. 5. Lastly, The Preparation of certain Vegetable and Animal Substances, according to all the more late Discoveries or Designations. XII. But from hence one Objection arises to be obviated, viz. That I have treated of many things in this Dispensatory, that I had handled formerly at large in my Pharmacopoeia Londinensis and Doron, and therefore might very well have been omitted here. To which I answer, 1. That this is another Man's Book, and my self but the Translator thereof; so that I could by no means with Justice and Honour have gelt the Text, or obliterated any part thereof, without a manifest Wrong and Injury to the Author. 2. That I have done no otherwise with respect to the aforenamed Books, than Schroder did with his Quercetanus Redivivus when he wrote his own Dispensatory. 3. That notwithstanding this seeming Repetition, or reiterating of the very same thing sometimes, you may possibly in this meet with that which is new concerning it, not contained in the other Books, which may recompence the Labour and Pains of a second Review. XIII. If any of the Gentlemen of the Profession, think, that in this Work or any other, we have done them Wrong or Prejudice, in discovering to the Vulgar, many of the Arcana of Our Art: We hope (as a Recompence for the same) to make them amends again, in divulging several other Secrets, which the most of them were wholly ignorant of before. However as a general Answer to this Objection, We think, that all particular Interests should sacrifice to the general, and that the Publick good ought ever to be preferred before the Private how dear and valuable soever. XIV. It is my Opinion, that the Art of Physick is not any particular Man's or Societies proper Right, more than anothers; but that every Man has an equal share in the same. But 'tis like Gold and Silver, he that wins it, or takes pains for it, shall have it. And as in one, every Man Unnumbered pagehas a Right by his Wit and Industry, to get Gold, if he can, and having got it, to make use of it; so in the other, every Man has a Right to study Physick if he pleases; and having once made himself Master of the Knowledge of it, has as great a Right to use it as we. Nor can I see ought, which may entitle any one particular Person to an Original Interest in it, more than it can another, whatever some self-ended Men may pretend to the contrary. XV. It is generous to do good to Mankind; and the more voluntary is is, the more acceptable. For my part, I owe so great a Friendship to all the World, that I wish every Man understood the Art as well as I do. And I should be content upon the Condition, that it would please the most Good and Infinite Being, to bless the Sons of Men with a perpetual State of Health, to seek out some other way of living. And as Health is the most valuable of all Earthly Happinesses; so I am of Opinion, all other Interests should vail to it. He can be no good Man, who desires to build up his Fortunes from the Miseries and Calamities of others; or to raise an Estate upon the Necessities of the Mean, and the Ruins of such as want Bread. XVI. For this Reason sake, I have for these Thirty Years together exercised my Art (as well as to live by it) as a necessary piece of Charity. I know no poor Creature that ever came to me, in my whole time, that once went from me, without my desired help Gratis. I have not only given them my Judgment or Opinion concerning their Diseases and Distempers; but if curable and Poor) have supplied them with all the Medical Necessaries for the whole Cure, till they became perfectly well, without demanding or requiring one Penny for it afterwards. And I have accounted the Restauration of such poor and wretched Creatures a greater Blessing to me, than if I had gotten the Wealth of both the Indies. I can't so well express my self concerning this Matter, as I can conceive it; but I am sure I should have been more pleased, and had a greater Satisfaction, in seeing such a helpless Creature, restored to its desired Health, than if I had found a very valuable Treasure. XVII. There are several Hundreds in this Great City, can bear me witness to this Truth. And for all the past Image 7 (unnumbered page)Good I have done in those Cases; as I can never repent it; so I resolve to continue it; for I certainly know, that I have had the signal Blessing of God attended my Endeavours for it: For which, (with all humility) I here publickly acknowledge his Goodness; and blessing his most merciful Hand, with bended Knees give Thanks for the same. Nor shall I ever desist the doing of what I have for thus many Years done in this kind, but am resolved thro' the Assistance of the most good God, to exercise the same Charity, and as largely extend it, to all the Poor and Miserable, who shall please to make use of it, whilst I have my Sense and Reason, and draw Breath upon Earth. XVIII. I have begun to render the Arts of Physick and Chyrurgery with their Appendices, the Materia Medica, Anatomy and Chymistry into English; and in doing of which, by this present Work, and Thirteen or Fourteen other Books, I have made a considerable Progress already; and intend not to desist, till I have fully made them in all their parts, compleat and intire. 'Tis every English Man's Birth-right, and an unspeakable Wrong to endeavour the keeping it from him. XIX. Nor do I know why any should be offended with me for thus doing, since it is but what Hippocrates and Galen, Celsus and Paracelsus, with hundreds more, all did, writing the System of Physick in their own Languages. Yea, and it is what the French (out of an Ambition of Glory) do at this day. I am sure we are their great Admirers in most things, and Ape them in whatsoever is vitious and ridiculous: And why we should not imitate them in a thing of such an essential Good I know not; unless you would oblige us to follow them only in their Vices, and eschew them in their Vertues. XX. I know that I have many Enemies in the World, and that the publishing this Work will create me many more, and those powerful ones, and malicious too: But I have overlookt all this, and have directed my Eye to the Recompence of Reward. If herein I have serv'd my Country and Generation, I have what I aimed at, and I am sure I shall have along with it the Defence of him, whose Mercies are over all his Works, and the Blessings of the Poor and Needy.

Byfield, M.D.",1699-01-01,,"""Image 1 (unnumbered page)  A Short Description and Vindication Of the True Sal Volatile Oleosum. OF THE ANCIENTS: Wherein 'tis prov'd The Great Medicine of the Spirits; And consequently, An Universal Remedy. By T. BYFIELD, M. D. LONDON, Printed for R. Cumberland, at the Angel in St. Paul's Church-yard, 1699. Price Two Pence. Image 2 (unnumbered page)    Unnumbered page A Short Description and Vindication Of the True Sal Volatile Oleosum. THE Errors about this Noble Medicine are so many and so gross, they deserve not to be refuted. But the disparagement done to Learning thereby, as well as Damage to the Healths, and Lives of Persons, has concerned me in the Preparation and Vindication of it. All the Learned Masters of Chymistry, who have treated of this Celebrated Medicine, have declared the Subject to be the Salt of Nature alone; altho they have obscurely wrote, concerning its Discovery and Preparation, which has precipitated many into very great Errors; who not knowing the Subject, busie themselves about other things, altogether unfit for this Work. But if they wou'd consider, what this Salt is in its own Nature, and what Qualities it hath, and so comparing the Qualities of their Compositions, with the Qualities of this Salt of Life, the Thing it self wou'd discover what is Truth, and what not. Image 3 (page 4)  Take a Description of it in these Particulars:  1. The Subject of the true Sal Volatile Oleosum, must be only one thing; For, Oleosum is opposite to Macrum, as Fat to Lean. 2. The Virtues and Powers of the Superiors and Inferiors, are concentrated in it. 3. It containeth in it self the Vital Fire. 4. 'Tis incombustible, and despiseth the Violence of the Flames. 5. 'Tis both Volatil and Fixt. 6. It containeth the three Principles of Nature, in the highest Purity; viz. Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury. 7. 'Tis of great Splendor, Ponderosity and Tenuity. 8. It contains the Vital Tincture of the World, in Potentia. 9. 'Tis the very Spring of Radical Moisture. 10. 'Tis only one Clean, Bright, Fat, Salt.  I know there are many, who will not approve of this Description of our Medicine, especially those who are employ'd about divers Mixtures and Compositions, which they call by this Name, altho they have nothing of the Nature and Virtues of the true Medicine. But such wou'd do well to consult the Ancient Philosophers, who expound the Principles, and their occult Operations. Then the certainty of this Salt wou'd be evidently known, by shewing Sulphur residing in it, in the form of a Subtil, Thin, Illuminating Oil, of an Ethereal Quality. And Mercury as the Aereal Humidity, and the inseparable Companion of Sulphur and the Medium to conjoin it with the Salt. And the Principle of Coagulation is the Salt, wherein is secur'd the Mercury and Sulphur, for it is call'd, Domicilium invisibilis seminis. Page 5  So you have the three Principles of Nature, all in one Saline Body. But Salt is always reckon'd first, by Chymists, because, whoever has the true Universal Salt of the World, has Mercury and Sulphur included. You must be very wary in the Choice of your Salt, for it is of most profound search, and differs much from all other Salts. Avicen discoursing of this Medicine, says, Salia cujuscunque generis sint, nostrae Arti sunt contraria, excepto Sale Naturae. Sal Naturae in centro Elementorum, qualificatione Astrorum, per Spiritum Mundi, absque ulla cessatione, generatur, & radiis Solis & Lunae in ma"""" Philosophico gubernatur. Arnoldus. But Morienus gives the Receipt: Spiritus �niversi dicitur Sal Spirituosum, & illud Sal extrahitur mensibus vernalibus, Sole ad nos redeunte: Illud ipsum Sal ex rore Majali colligitur, ex eoque fit & conficitur Medicina �niversalis. If your Salt be right, in the Anatomy of it, you'l see a certain Subtil, Shining, Transparent Oil, (which is the Oleosum of the Medicine) full of Active Virtue, and containing the Vital Fire of the World; But most Temperate, Equal and Similar to Life in Man. For the Natural Heat, or Fire in Bodies, is that Vital Flame, which forms its own Body, and is nothing else but the Spirits, or Fiery Life in Creatures. And this Fire, or Life, which preserves Beings, must be cloathed with such an Essence, as can pierce and penetrate all Bodies whatsoever; for where it cannot penetrate, it cannot quicken and illuminate. The Sun by its Fire doth excite and quicken every Image 4 (page 4) 1 page duplicate	 Page 5 1 page duplicate	 Image 5 (page 4) 1 page duplicate	 Page 5 1 page duplicate	 Image 6 (page 6) thing upon Earth: So the Fire which is proper an"" peculiar to every Creature does preserve in it Life. For we find that when our Heat or Warmth begin"" to decrease in its wonted Activity, we grow Dull� Cold and Unactive; and when it ceaseth altogether we Die and Perish. It may be observ'd in declining Age, when Natural Heat abates, that a cold Phlegmacy and rawness abounds with a crude Earthiness, and such Persons have often fresh insipid Urines, for want of the Salt of Life, which is inseparable from the Volatil Living Fire. Experience shews that wheresoever our Fire is strong, Salt abounds, as in Sweat, Urine, &c. The Salter any ones Sweat and Urine is, the more lively and vigorous he is. So that Salt is the consequent of Fire. Wheresoever Salt is, there Fire is also, whether it be in Air, Earth, Vegetables, Animals, &c. Some of the Ancients have called the Sun the Salt of the World. For which reason 'tis probable, the Greeks call'd Salt ��� and the Sun -����. The Romans called the Sun Sol, and Salt Sal, representing the likeness of their Natures, by the likeness of their Names. 'Tis said Mark 9. 49. Every one shall be salted with Fire. And this Fire, or Life, which is in the Salt, is properly that, which preserves the Creatures from Putrefaction: For when this Life hath once left the Salt, we are told, Matth. 5. 13. That it is good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trod under Foot by men. Every Creature hath its vivifying Spirit or Fire, and stands in need of a Spiritual Nutriment, which is plentiful in the Air, and to be attracted in the Form of a tender Oily Salt. And since Spirit of Blood is a fine Volatil Salt, what more similar and uniform, than the Salt of Air to that of Blood. Page 7  But 'tis from the Sulphur and Mercury contain'd in the Salt, that it becomes capable of Production; for with them the Volatil living Fire insinuates it self most intimately with its influential Virtues giving Splendor and Spirit to the Salt: Thus it becomes agreeable to all Creatures for the sustaining of Life, and those Bodies that are most impregnated with it, are in a better State of Health and Vigor. Besides 'tis the true Vital Ferment of Bodies, and Root of Radical Moisture; For by the Action of the Fire upon the Principles, is generated the Balsom of Nature and Seminal Spirits, and these are coagulated in this Salt of Nature, which is the Soul of the Earth and of all other things. If the Earth were depriv'd of this Salt, it wou'd want the Power of Sprouting and Budding. It is the only Subject under the Concave of the Moon, in which the Virtues as well of the Superiors, as of the Inferiors, lye concentrated, and out of which alone by the Chymical Art, our Learned Masters prepar'd their true Sal Volatile Oleosum. And not from the Lean, Impoverisht, Caustic Salts of any Bodies whatsoever, in Conjunction with Oils, Spirits, Perfumes, &c. after every ones Fancy, wherewith the World does so abound. For at this rate may be made 1000 sorts. Whenas there is but only one in Nature, viz. A Clean, Bright, Fat, Virgin-Salt, which open'd by Art, shews a transparent white Sulphur, or Oil, that is of so great Moment; For in the white, lyes the incombustible red Sulphur, which cloaths the Fiery Life of Beings, and is the Spring of indelible, Vital Tincture. I have chose to give this Salt, thus open'd, for the more easie mixing with Liquors, and its readiness to be assimulated. Besides 'tis a demonstration of its Oilyness, which manifests the Medicine and a piece of Art. For the Body is wholly Saline, and by an easie heat I can lock up the Mercury and Sulphur again, and represent Image 7 (page 8) an intire Body of Salt. So you have the three Principles of Nature in Unity. This is a great Secret, and a branch of oceult Philosophy. Honest Avicen, in very poor Latin, writing of this Medicine, says thus, Qui ergo scit Salem & ejus solutionem, Ille scit verum Salem Volatilem Oleosum Antiquorum Sapientum: Pone ergo tuam mentem super Salem, nec cogites de aliis, nam in ipso solo occultatur Medicina Vera. From what is said, 'tis manifest, that this Salt alone hath Vital Endowments, let it appear under what form soever. And so it becomes the genuine, adaequate Medicine of the Spirits, and consequently an Universal Medicine. In Man is a peculiar, vivifying, innate Spirit, which contributes both Light and Life to the Body; for conserving and sustaining the same. And it manifests its own exquisite Skill, (as Experience daily proves) in separating the pure from the impure, of all our Meat and Drink. This Spiritual Essence, the Active, Internal Agent in all Bodies, is often invaded by Diseasy Ferments, received from Meats, Drinks, Corrupt and Unwholsom Airs, &c. And very often no longer capable to suppress those Disorders, without the help of a Medicine naturally gifted, to cast a friendly Ray or Beam of Light, upon the discompos'd and darkned Spirit, by which it is enabled to expell what offends. And of such a Nature is our Medicine, Homogeneal to our Spirits, whereby they are kept undisturb'd, and Life and Health maintain'd. Our Natural Spirits are Volatil Oily Substances, therefore by Sympathy they are delighted and refresht with our Volatil Oily Salt. Spirituum Oleaginitas consistit in Sale Oleoso Volatili. Page 9  That which Fabricated the Man, must be the Conserver of that Frame. Diseasy Powers aim at nothing else but its Destruction. Yet no morbifick Power can exist in the Body of Man, where the Spirit of Life stands clear and undefil'd. As is apparent in a Pestilential Season: In some Bodies the Spirits being clean and strong, remain untouch't, and no Venom introduc't. But in others the Spirits being not so clear, or strong enough to defend themselves, admit of Pestilential Airs, and so form the Disease: Yet if timely assisted by Natural Remedies, easily and readily expel the same. When the Spitits have any Diseasy Impress, by the means of a generous Medicine, they can rectify their own defiled Air, and illuminate and restore the discomposed Spirits to their pristin State, so that no Disease can long abide. In Sacred Scriptures we read that Elisha, at the request of the Inhabitants of Jericho, intending to heal their Venomous Waters, went not to the Streams, but to the Fountain it self, and there cast in Salt. So ought every Physician in his Administration of Remedies, to respect the Fountain or Original, not the Streams or Effects of Diseases. For That, by which a Disease is form'd, is That, to which the Remedy ought to be apply'd. A true Medicine relieves the Natural Spirits, d""bilitated or disturb'd"
